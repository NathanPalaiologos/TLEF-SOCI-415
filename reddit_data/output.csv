author: Tall-Jackfruit7375
text body: To start things off I ll explain my current living situation and the double life I kinda live My dad works in a city 2 hours away from the one my mom and rest of siblings live in I ve decided to move with him and my younger sibling for a better fit uni for me And i regularly visit my mother and siblings with my dad and brother every weekend My dad is a severe narcissist I won t get into depth as it s too much but if I were to describe him with a few words they would be cold careless unemotional extremely selfish and only cares for himself very manipulative The scary thing about this guy is he doesn t show any of this at all he is nice and doesn t shout or physically abuse I had to pick this out of him by situations that happened between him and my mother and I am an extremely analytical person so over the years I ve noticed his habits body language his words of choice what he does with problems between me and my siblings or problems in general I ve diagnosed him as a narcissist He fits all of narcissistic traits perfectly Recently Him and my mother have had a strong fallout where he almost cut her off and he accused her of things And also said things to her such as go to fucking hell and threatening with divorce he also attempted to kick her out the house This was all done verbally and very coldly That pretty much tells you the type of person he is Moving on to my family I ve always had problems severe with my mother she s extremely religious I am too but not as extreme and she s caught me with stuff that completely changed her view of me My privacy was crossed aggressively I was hated so bad But eventually those problems with her faded away and my relationship with her is improved I think she still invades my privacy but in secret whenever I visit on the weekends by looking through my phone and such Both my sisters don t like me that much even though they don t say it the first one I used to be very close with but used me and manipulated me and also treated me horribly so I ve cut her off but not directly The second one I was never close to but she talks to me and treats me as if I m 10 and doesn t care about me at all and I ve gotten into a few fights with her And this is a simple situation that happened between me and them recently a month or two ago to give you an idea of how they are casually with me It was the evening maybe 4 6 pm They walked in on my room striked up convo with me as I was using an iPad that I had saved up for myself over the range of a few months Everything was fine and we were chatting and laughing suddenly it turns into them severely attacking me verbally by questioning why I even got it the first sister was telling me I was ruining their chances of my dad buying things for them and devices by telling them to do the same as me the iPad was a used gen 10 in pink 64 gigabytes it was extremely cheap which my dad is aware of I kept explaining to them that he would never as he knows it s cheap and he wouldn t just not buy them devices because I bought myself a very cheap device to play games and watch shows on I was described as stupid dumb selfish and a little kid It happened aggressively and it was done in 2 5 minutes worth of speaking After that I left my room and cried and I went to my mother to tell her about this they came and it turned into a big fight of me crying the first sister lying about everything and accusing me of being manipulative and a liar also playing the victim to my mom Second sister was involved too but not as much After this there was tension and she attempted an apology a week after Anyways many more situations happened between me and my family over the course of these months And my mother is someone who s easily influenced but I ll get to that result later So after explaining each one of them and situations that happened between them and me or just them I hope it gave you an idea to why as what I m about to say is happening to me I ve been excluded by the family they go out together and don t tell me my father left this week for my sister s graduation and didn t tell me till the day before and it was on a school week I couldn t do anything or come or book a seat for the graduation my two sisters and my mom and father went out and I was left alone with my little brother who is too young to notice doesn t care and doesn t know in the community we re in And they went out for dinner and such Also my mom has been constantly ignoring my messages never calling me and I d literally beg her to reply but she wouldn t answer me at all and she doesn t care at all Whenever I arrive in the weekend I m welcomed with a hi while my brother and father are hugged and sat with My sisters don t text me nor care about me at all and I have a strong feeling my mom and them are talking about me because this is how they are when they severely shittalk me and exclude me so it s confirmed for me due to a constant pattern I ve never done anything bad to them or did anything that affected the family I ve always been hated for situations and experiences that happened to me as a child that I couldn t control I AM IGNORED AND HATED FOR SITUATIONS THAT ONLY AFFECTED ME THAT I COULD NOT CONTROL There is so much more that they have done to me that I could not describe even if you gave me a 100 years to tell you what I said was only the tip of the iceberg and I don t want to say anymore as it s extremely late right now and I don t want to cry in this cramped apartment I have no genuine friends only people I sit with that go out without me I only have my partner that I am very very close to that my family can t and doesn t know about he helps me so much but we re gonna becoming long distance for 2 4 years soon and he s already dealing with his own family problems that are much stronger than mine He is literally the only thing I have I am helpless I ve given out I cry everyday and I am so fucking confused and shaky I don t know what I can do I hate my life and I wish I could have a proper mother or father figure I cry about how nice my professors are to me I cry about meeting my friend s families I ve had two male teachers that I ve horribly cried in front of due to my problems Please do not make this weird as no boundaries were crossed and I am an extremely assertive and strong person but it doesn t show due to how I m explaining my life situation they are extremely caring people who have supported me in the smallest ways and I will be telling my future kids about them one day The first prof I ve opened up to about my hate for the people around me and how my friends are and I ve cried in front of him really bad when my dad threatened to drop me out due to my grades and he helped me out He s also pulled me out of lectures a few times due to him noticing my state But I never shared much The second prof I am not as close to but I ve cried in front him after class due to a group project and he noticed that I was extremely sad and anxious I am genuinely tired of life I want to find friends even if it s online just to bond with and be close with and there for I struggled with so much more I want help and someone to talk to and I want to know ways I could improve my life by myself such as hobbies and more I game a lot which helps me and I m very close with my sweet partner which id die for And I also cry which helps or go on dinner dates by myself and bike around at night or I make myself a nice iced matcha But I need more help I need opinions and advice or literally anything Say what you want I am genuinely in desperation and I want hope in life and someone to show me my first step to greatness and happiness",,,

text body: So it was a normal outing and we were on the car ride home My dad was driving i was riding shotgun and my mom and brother were all in the back My mom urged my brother to lean on her shoulder but he refused and slammed his head back into the car door window where he was originally trying to doze off My mom yelled at him scolding him for the attitude My dad told her to leave him alone and mom didnt have any of it She started going on and on about how none of us followed anything that she said and doubled down by saying it was in my dad s blood My dad raised his voice yelling that she didn t always have the right to boss us around My mom yelled back and at this point my brothers eyes got teary as i glanced back My dad then said that she was using us as an instrument to flex on other people especially parents at school since we were doing well academically That was the tipping point My mom got extremely mad and started blabbering about how badly we treat her despite having given all her life to raise us The car got quiet then after a while she erupted into screaming and tears and started yelling at my dad to let her off the car when we were not even a quarter of the way home She started to try and shove my brother aside to open the door in a car moving 140kph opened it for a moment and almost managed to jump out This was when i started to realize that this was a really bad situation as i hear my brother and mother crying as they struggle My mom was sobbing and yelling about how we treated her and that we never cared about her In a moment of anger and annoyance i bursted out confessing the many times i tried to kick the bucket after making her cry My mom had no reaction and was still sobbing Then just when i started to tear up i heard my dad speak in a soft shaky voice Please dont think like that You are all i have i dont want to lose you I cried Really fucking hard He held my head closer to his chest as he quietly sobs The person i see as the strongest man in the world who i idolize beyond anything is in his most vunerable state That broke me I never saw him cry or even show a hint of sadness after it was a quiet ride home This was the first time my family got into any sort of argument and so everyone was shaken This morning the day after i awoke and went to get breakfast in the kitchen I saw my dad staring blankly into nothingness while eating I didnt know what to do so i went back to my room and traced my face onto my pillow with tears My mom doesnt talk to us anymore and swears she never will I had to tear up the house to find my documents so i could go enroll and before i left i tried talking to my dad who still has not touched his eggs No reply When i came back he called me into my room He bought me a birthday gift I had nothing left in me in order to shed tears so i just hugged him for a really long time He is the only person that greeted me out of my whole family I will hold him closer to my heart than anyone else in this shithole of a world",,,

text body: Long story short my sister in law has always struggled with her mental health because of growing up with an abusive mother She s never really dealt with it or sought help Covid happened and she s basically spiraled ever since First off she became very sick with covid in 2020 and soon developed a phobia surrounding covid to the point of to this day she will not leave the house or go inside any public buildings She never worked in the first place because of her anxiety She forced my brother to find a remote job She home schools their kids They don t go to the grocery store No one is allowed in their house without a mask They will only see family at outdoor functions The kids have zero friends except their cousins who they can FaceTime My brother has never been the type to be controlled But he s basically a shell of a person at this point It hurts my heart for him and the children Anytime any of my family tries to talk to them about this situation my sister in law attacks us and freaks out My brother does the same He turns into a monster and acts like we re heartless and don t care about them They both need severe psychological help but we can t even suggest it or they freak out Their oldest daughter is 8 and she already is crying for help and wants to have friends and go places I have no idea what to do to help them It started out as they just seemed extra cautious because of covid but now I think it s a full on phobia of life itself They are in a bubble and won t let anyone in I fear what will happen to the children as they get older if they continue to be isolated Is there anything I can do or do they need to want help to get help I ve considered an intervention with my brother to try and help him see how much control she has over him but he just seems so tired and like he s given up trying to help her He just defends her",,,sibling

author: YoBoyFrank
text body: Sorry if this is long but at this point I m a bit desperate I feel like this has shaped my family dynamic for years I m also sorry if it feels cluttered I m not a native speaker Me 22M and my mother 45F argue frequently My mom tells me that sometimes I tend to be sarcastic and that I don t own my mistakes An ex also told me the owning mistakes thing in the past and I will address it later in this post she tells me that she feels like everything she tells me is wrong to me and I tend to dismiss it or mock her I know I tend to be overly sarcastic and have already encouraged her to point out this type of behavior when she s not feeling it So she tells me that she can never say anything to me because when she does I get mad at her But here s the thing I don t really get mad when she corrects me I m normally very receptive of criticism especially with friends and family it s always her tone and her yelling that I guess makes me go into defensive mode when we argue For instance yesterday I told her that I was worried about my gut health and wanted to see a doctor soon because of some changes I ve been noticing in my stool I said this in a calm way She started YELLING and scolding me because she had already expressed her concerns with my health she pointed out I was being very irresponsible with my sleep schedule and usually skipped breakfast but I ve been hitting the gym recently slept well lost weight and all that stuff has normalized a few weeks ago so currently I have a healthy lifestyle but she told me to go to the doctor to do a general check up for any deficiencies but I didn t really want to do it because I knew I was fine I also study medicine So when she started yelling at me I told her calmly to please tone it down she immediately said she wasn t yelling at me She told me she was mad because I told her this 2 days prior to our family trip But I just told her because I wanted her to know I didn t really wanted to rush a doctors appointment and was open to have it checked out later It was a heated argument and I am in disbelief because I don t think a minor health concern should trigger an argument of said caliber When she scolds me she says things that straight up aren t true like when she said she wasn t yelling or brings up mistakes of mine from the past I always feel the stupid need of clarifying things for her and this only ends up flaring up the conversation For some context I come from a very gaslighty family My grandmother literally always gaslights my mom and makes her feel guilty about stuff and I know my mother does the same when it comes to arguing but today she started crying and told me what I wrote in the beginning of the post she also said that my type of attitude was the same reason she fell apart with my dad divorced this comment on her part almost broke me but I stayed calm and just told her ok but I absolutely didn t feel like it was Am I in the wrong here If you re a parent have you experienced from your kids the sarcastic dismissive attitude my mom says she sees on me with your kids How could I change this How can I be more receptive when she shares her concerns with me and be less sarcastic Sometimes I just feel she warns me of obvious things and worries about me to the point of obsession which I don t think has ever been healthy productive during my upbringing How can I practice owning my mistakes Has anyone been in a family with a similar dynamic issues Feel free to ask any questions and thank you in advance TLDR Mom says I m too sarcastic and dismissive towards her but I just don t like the way she speaks yells to me how can I be more receptive towards her overly obsessive observations without hurting her feelings",22,Male,

text body: I already posted this in r africanparents under a different title but I haven t had any responses I 19F come from a very different family compared to a traditional or even a normal african home My parents are divorced which isn t abnormal as we live in the UK and my dad has 3 other kids from 3 different women I have a younger brother 16M whom I ve grown up with as we both have the same parents and I am not close to my 3 other siblings who were all born out of wedlock not important to me but he is an ex pastor and very devoted christian and my entire family are also christian s I am not but obviously this is very frowned upon who are 29M 22M and 1F My mum had no idea about my older brothers as my dad hid it from her and his entire family and he had abandoned them only occasionally sending money and speaking to them which of course isn t their fault My dad recently had another child 5 years after my parents divorced I find it hard to bond with my older brothers 29M 22M and this could be because they live back home in Africa and I had no idea about their existence until i was about 10 years old but even after my dad confessed we maintained minimal to no contact This includes my younger sister 1F who was basically a surprise baby He had gotten a lady from his church pregnant again absolutely frowned upon and they had hidden the pregnancy The only reason I found out is because a couple days after she was born I had visited my dad so he could give me a driving lesson and she the baby was in the house and he dragged me upstairs and made me hold her whilst taking pictures I was very uncomfortable and confused Recently my older brother 29M had told me he is getting married he has 3 kids 12M 8M and 6F and the lady who he is marrying has 2 kids of her own 15M 13M whom she had just before she graduated high school college sixth form I was asked if I would attend the wedding l gave a vague response as there is no set date and said If I can afford the plane ticket and if I am available I will try to be there But shortly after this he had begged me for money which I refused to give him as he has a history of alcohol addiction nevertheless I would not give him any money because I am a 19 year old living off of student finance I am living comfortably and have no complaints as it s exam season and I m just trying to survive this Chemistry paper if anything lol and I have vowed to myself that I will not be giving any relatives money I am no longer close to my dad as after my parents divorced when I was 12 he became a sh tty father there s a lot of stuff he did but l m not gonna get into it and I also realised he was just a horrible controlling and contradicting person I am at university so I want to make the next step in cutting him completely out of my life this includes his entire family all 9 of my uncles and aunts and their kids and potentially my half siblings as I have no emotional bond towards them This family stresses me the f ck out as everyday there s a new problem whether that s financial mental or physical FYI My dad s side of the family is sh t like they have their own problems which would take at least a century to explain They are mostly to do with money relationships marriages failing and cheating lying addiction issues lack of education judging lack of employment stealing lack of parenting people popping out babies like they are loans and grudges that have been held longer than Mount Everest has been considered a mountain On top of that they were incredibly rude and disrespectful to my mum Would I be wrong to cut them out of my life TDLR I am no longer close to my dad and at university so I am planning to cut him and his entire family out of my life However I have no idea if I am being too harsh on him and my half siblings even though we have no emotional bond Sorry for the long post _",19,Female,

text body: I want to put one of my many family dramas out there to get some advice and also to share because it s just too damn juicy not to So this story takes place many years ago Like early 2000 s I was a child when it happened and didn t find out until I was 28 Anyways The story told from my mom s perspective is that she my brother my sister my sister s husband BIL were all partying and drinking She didn t go into too much detail other than that her and my BIL hooked up My mom said she was drunk and blacked out and then he took advantage of her She said she couldn t move She couldn t stop him He raped her My sister didn t know about this until 10 15 years later when my brother talked my mom into telling her When my mom told my sister what her husband did my sister didn t believe her said she was lying and made it up and stopped talking to our mom My brother tried talking to her and tried telling her the truth and she didn t believe him either and stopped talking to him as well Not long after that I got a text from my BIL telling me that he misses me and asking if we can meet up and if he could take me out to dinner I immediately got the ick and told my sister about it I even had the texts to prove it She then got pissed at me and said that I made it up and that me our mom and brother were just trying to turn her against her husband She thought we were all lying It s been 10 years since she s talked to any of us It s killing my mom and myself She feels like she lost a child and I feel like I lost my one and only sister we were best friends I also lost a niece and nephew her kids and I since not speaking I ve had a daughter whom she s never met The story doesn t end here though in fact there s a prequel My sister met her husband when she was 16 and got pregnant A few years after having the baby they got married Another few years after that my sister was going through some papers in their office desk when she found a paper about child support with his name on it She questioned him about it and that s when he revealed to her that he had another child before he had one with my sister So for YEARS he hid a child from my sister When my sister found out she was devastated Now that the rats out of the bag he wants to be in the child s life Then my sister gives him an ultimatum She tells him it s either her or the kid he hid from her He told her that he couldn t pick between the two and when he told her he would leave her she agreed to letting the child come around So after hiding a child from her and lying about it to hitting on me and lastly raping our mother she is still with the guy She chose him over her own family and it s truly beyond me I miss my big sister and my niece and nephew more than anything I don t think her and my mom could ever make amends but I wish that she would reach out to me I don t think she ever would though It seems like she s on her high horse I ve tried reaching out to my niece who s in her twenties now She never texted back I never did anything to her or to my sister to deserve this I would think my niece would want to know our side of the story but I m beginning to think my sister has brainwashed her It s just shitty that she stayed with a man who s a liar and a rapist Just to add my mom and sister were super close Best friends The 3 of us were best friends We did everything together When my sister got pregnant at 16 my mom let her boyfriend move in with us and my mom helped raise the baby My niece grew up thinking I was her sister that s how close we all were",38,,sibling

author: Majestic-Might-4171
text body: It s hard to know where to start I wish I had more answers but I don t know how to help her next so here goes nothing My youngest sister is 24 years old and has struggled with depression for the last 8 10 years My family experienced a traumatic event where our dad committed suicide in our home unexpectedly with zero awareness he was struggling with his mental health This was before any of the mental health movements or any real knowledge of what mental health struggling looked like I went to therapy for 3 years and after that I was able to reflect and see that there were some signs especially with his attention to robin williams death After he left my mom became kind of a non parent and my sisters were still developing They were 14 and 16 at the time of his death and I was 20 I went into college and continued trying to help my family They ended up all going to college My middle sister has a very strong willpower and is doing well but our youngest hasn t spent time in therapy very much and has a very negative view of herself Any negative occurrences she finds a way to tie it back to herself and blame herself and almost self validate the way she thinks about herself My mom took her to get her brain scanned 2 years back my mom is Eastern European and doesn t understand mental health but believed maybe the scan would explain my dads death as well the scan came up that her brain no longer is producing Seratonin and they identified she was severely depressed Ever since then she has gone to see one therapist for maybe 3 sessions and saw a psychiatrist about getting anti depressants and I believe is still taking the ones they prescribed but I don t think just taking pills without working through and processing everything she is feeling is the answer She doesn t believe therapy works for her and it s just getting worse and worse I just need some advice on how to navigate this and I know I am leaving out plenty more but there s just no way to fully explain everything over the last 10 years I almost feel like the next step is to find a licensed psychiatrist therapist or someone who can point us in the right direction of what she needs to be doing And like sit with her and tell them our side too I just don t know what to do but I do know not doing anything will eventually end the same way my dad ended Any advice is appreciated",30,,sibling

author: CrimsonMeliodas
text body: Hi everyone I ve never posted on reddit before and this is an old account so I majorly apologise if this is very lengthy or is hard to follow I m 18F almost 19 and live with my mum 51F my stepdad 31M and my younger sister 9F I m currently a university student finishing up my first year in university and the problems with my mother keep stacking up but have gotten worse throughout my year in university I have chosen to stay living at home because of a few reasons these including I have to pick up my little sister from primary school every other week I have high functioning ADHD and am currently on a 3 year waiting list for medication and don t cope well with other people being within my safe space and have a hard time staying organised so my room is usually quite messy and unorganised I also have a medium distance girlfriend who has autism and doesn t cope well with being around multiple people she is unfamiliar with as it makes her uncomfortable so living at home allows me to see her often while minimising costs and makes it easier for both of us to see each other comfortably I want to also mention that my mum really likes my girlfriend and has no issue with letting her come over every month for a week or two her and my mum get along well and she encourages her to come over often so that isn t causing the issues I have As I mentioned I m a university student and the only income I get is from student finance and that s it I am physically unable to get a job because I have to pick my little sister up from her primary school every other week which means I need to be home to pick her up and babysit her for a bit until my mum comes back from work Furthermore I also need to then babysit my little sister on her school breaks which can last from a week up to 2 weeks and then 6 7 weeks in her summer break which will make me unable to get a job more than I already struggle I also must babysit her throughout the week when my mum and stepdad go shopping or go anywhere because my little sister doesn t like going with them anymore she just likes playing on her tablet all the time This means I always need to babysit her whenever they go anywhere and this happens often throughout the week I also have to skip quite a few of my Uni classes because they override the time slot that I have to pick my sister up meaning that I also miss valuable teaching time within Uni and basically have to skip an entire week of Uni to pick up my sister As I am only on student finance and am physically unable to get a job I only rely on my student finance which is extremely hard to manage due to my ADHD and how I must deal with all my personal costs with no financial help This is a problem because I have to constantly pay for prescriptions my glasses all my travel costs my girlfriends train fare when she sees me and my own when I see her all my clothes new utilities and etc Additionally I also pay 200 rent every month to live at my house This is meant to include all my food water bill and electricity However these are all met apart from the food part My mum usually pays for me to eat throughout the week by making meals at dinner time for me when it is group food otherwise I make food myself On weekends my mum doesn t cook because she says she can t be bothered because of work so she orders take out I have to pay for my own share within this take out Every time she orders it she pays for her my sister and my stepdad but she always asks me if I want to put in for a takeaway meaning I have to pay for my own food when she orders this This bothers me because I pay rent which is meant to include ALL my food her words but I have to put in for take out on a weekend because my mum doesn t prepare dinner If I say no then I get no food and she only orders it for them 3 and I m left with no food from the takeout These take outs aren t fancy either they re just your average take out that you d get from around the corner or something like that If I say no I then have to either order my own take out later on at night or I have to prepare my own food This bothers me more than it normally would because I do not possess very good cooking skills My mum has taught me no life skills even though I ve asked plenty of times when I was a teenager for her to teach me how to cook use the washer etc She refused She never helped me nor taught me She said she would and then never did Now that I m 18 she expects me to magically know how to do everything and know how to cook I can only make simple meals that you use an air fryer for or simple dishes like pasta or breakfast foods because I ve not been taught how to cook otherwise When I don t know how to perform these skills I am belittled for not knowing how even though she hasn t taught me when I ve asked For example when I didn t know how to turn our oven on she came in and sighed then said for fuck sake op how do you not know how to turn an oven on You re 18 now you should know how to do these things it s not hard I replied back saying I haven t been taught how to do it and I have asked before if you could teach me but you never did These comments from her are quite common too She says comments like that whenever I can t do basic skills because I haven t been taught how to do them Therefore I have to either spend a lot of money a month on take out food or I won t get fed or I have to deal with belittling while I make simple food which I personally don t find really fair I also have a challenging time saving due to my ADHD and find myself splurging on things that are to do with my fixations as I am a collector This never overrides my rent or anything like that I always have money saved in my savings for rent but paying for everything including leisure is a lot of costs and I spend a lot of money on replacing stuff that I need and paying for all the costs that come with being an adult I m not expecting her to help or give me any money to help me out as I m 18 it s my responsibility to manage my costs But as I pay rent I think it s only fair that if they are ordering food I should also automatically get my food too instead of paying my own share even though I also pay to live there Now feel free to criticise me on this opinion I m here to get advice after all I just personally think it s not fair I have also spoken to my girlfriend and she shares the same opinion as me and thinks it s not fair the way she treats me but I also want opinions from an outside perspective because my girlfriend might be a little biased as she doesn t really like my mum all that much because of how she behaves lol which I m not faulting her for at all Adding onto the leisure spending my mum also complains about how I spend my money and always asks me how much of my student finance I have left in a snarky tone if you can see what I mean haha This is usually when I buy something a little more expensive like a new figure for my collection or new clothes or something like that She usually asks that whenever I buy something expensive and makes snarky comments about what I buy and spend my money on If I go out with my girlfriend a lot she will make a snarky comment about my spending habits and belittle me for spending a lot although she has done research into neurodiversity and how it affects things like that due to my sister having autism I was only diagnosed recently with ADHD last August when my mum kept insisting it was autism for over a year when I told her years prior that I think it was ADHD She didn t offer to get me tested or anything like that when she believed I have autism she just kept correcting me when I said I think I have ADHD and told me I was getting obsessed with thinking I have it Her only reasons for believing I had autism was because I ve had a fixation on a video game ever since I was around 5 and because I m a picky eater Furthermore with the money complaining she complains when I try making plans with my friends or have any plans with my stepdad because she is going stuck with my sister so she essentially complains when she has to babysit my sister on her own meaning I have to spend less time with my stepdad because she complains about having to take care of my sister or she can t stand him being away from her for too long However when she has plans I am automatically expected to be free to babysit my sister I m expected to cancel my plans and make myself free to babysit my sister so she can have her plans This happens very often She cancels my plans because she doesn t have anyone else to babysit my sister and automatically expects me to be available for it meaning I have to babysit my sister for a whole day and usually for the entire night if the plans are staying at a hotel or being away with my other siblings This further solidifies why I can t have a job because I would physically have no time for the job due to how much I take care of my sister Adding onto the financial struggles I have gotten my last student finance payment which was paid at the end of April and I have had to spend 600 of that on a new PC My old gaming PC was very outdated as my brother gave it to me for free when he built his new one That PC is very outdated as he used it for gaming back when he was around 14 15 and he is now 22 The PC lagged on any game and made it EXCEEDINGLY difficult to play games such as Fortnite as I d lag just running around The storage was also getting full as I used that for all my Uni work and it only had around 400GB of storage I desperately had to get a new PC as my main hobby is gaming and I need one for university I spent 600 on my PC now because of how high end the PC is it has a lot of storage and it ll last me a lot of years My mum hasn t changed her behaviour although she knew I needed to buy a new PC She has just been complaining more about my spending and looming over me saying I need to make my student finance last until September I ve been offered no help with the cost of this PC which I didn t expect as it is a lot of money but I am still being asked to put in money for a takeaway every week and I have to pay for my own alcohol when I drink with them and get don t get offered any All other leisure s need to come from my own wallet which I understand however my PC has set me back a lot and I can t afford to keep up with all my expenses being 600 down and not being able to get a job whatsoever My sisters summer break is coming up too meaning I have to babysit her for the entire summer all week and I won t be able to get a job to support myself during this time making this a whole lot harder This is quite long now so I ll wrap it up with this last point My mum likes to humiliate me a lot and I m sure she gets a kick out of it I ll explain Since I have high functioning ADHD I find it extremely difficult to organise myself and to help with this I usually keep certain items like my wallet and such in a certain spot so I can always find it otherwise it s as if its disappeared haha I also have the very known floordrobe that most ADHD people have I would prefer not to have the floordrobe but I have no space in my drawers or wardrobe for most of my clothes because the wardrobe is taken up by her excess dresses which take up most of the area in the wardrobe meaning I ve got a huge lack of space in storage of clothing essentially meaning it has to end up on the floor My disorganisation means my room usually ends up very messy and I get executive dysfunction when it gets messy even though I want nothing more than to clean it My lovely girlfriend is such an angel as she helps me with this as she loves tidying up as it helps her de stress and she knows how much I struggle with keeping my space organised and tidy She won t judge and she helps me in anyway she can However my mum is the opposite and she humiliates and belittles me for how disorganised and messy my room can get sometimes She purposefully waits until I am out of the house to go into my room to purposefully get herself angry so she can send me very passive aggressive texts telling me how disgusting I am for my space and how I should be ashamed and humiliating me When I say she does this as soon as I leave the house I mean it An hour after I m out I ll check my phone and there will always be a text about how disgusting I am She purposefully goes in when I m not there just to rial herself up about it and if it s not when I m out of the house she makes snarky comments about my room and tries humiliating me that way It makes it worse that she purposefully tries to humiliate me in front of my girlfriend to belittle me and make me feel humiliated about my own space She will tell my girlfriend about my room and say to me she wouldn t like the state of your room when she sees it My girlfriend has reiterated multiple times to my mum that she doesn t mind whatsoever and likes helping me because she knows I struggle and that her helping me clean also helps her destress My mum replies to this saying I don t know how you can like going in there and dealing with it even though my girlfriend assures her that she struggles herself and likes helping me clean and organise When my brother lived with us he was worse than me He was your average gamer boy who didn t leave their room at all and was what people would call a basement dweller and I m sure you can fill in the blanks for how his room was Even then he was never as humiliated and belittled as much as I am even though I have a reason as to why I m like that and have shown multiple times that I don t want to have my space like that My apologises that this is long there is a lot to get out as it is a long story and there are a lot of details that I have left out of this post for conciseness I just want some advice and opinions on what I could do moving forward to try helping me deal with this as it has been difficult for me as it has just gotten worse as I ve gotten older All advice is appreciated and thank you so much for reading and any advice that is given I ll try answer as many questions as I can TL DR My mum makes it hard for me to manage my own funds within my household although I pay rent to live there as a university student I am unable to get a job to support myself due to taking care of my little sister for most of my time She also belittles me because of lacking basic skills how I spend my money and humiliates me because of my disability Any advice on how to deal with someone like this",18,Female,daughter

text body: My 29m brother 27m and I were never close but we used to get along quite well until he moved in with his girlfriend 28f They actually live with her parents in the countryside like an hour drive away My brother is in psychology school and his girlfriend doesn t work Things were still okay until I met my now husband 44m two years ago The first time I introduced my husband to my family my mom loved him immediately but I felt like my brother and his girlfriend were both uncomfortable After that they avoided us as much as they could and found silly excuses to avoid attending family gatherings When we got married last year they only came to the ceremony and left right after because they had a long drive home and they didn t come to the family party the next day without saying why It made me sad but it made my mom even sadder and she ended up crying in my arms on my wedding day not the kind of memory I want to keep Later last year my brother and I celebrated out birthday together we were born two years and one day apart and his girlfriend refused to come During dinner my brother announced that they were going to get married next year and that his girlfriend was pregnant No one said anything except my grandma who shouted how can you be so stupid or something like that Turns out my mom knew already She had told them that they should wait until they were independent and financially stable before having a baby and that s why the girlfriend didn t come to our birthday My brother didn t react but stopped answering his phone for months I had lunch with him once when he said that he was hurt by our grandma s reaction and that he wouldn t talk to her anymore until she would make the first step and apologize I said it was immature of him our grandma said what she thought like she always did and if he had a problem it was up to him to stand up for himself Anyway he didn t and he and his girlfriend didn t come for christmas even though our grandma called him to apologize I texted him that he was selfish and that he was hurting our mom he didn t answer He showed up to my workplace a few weeks later to ask me to apologize because I insulted him by calling him selfish Later my mom told me that he had called her to say that he felt rejected in the family because I took all the space and that his girlfriend and him were uncomfortable around my husband and me because we were too extravagant After that conversation it seemed that things were going a little better We had another christmas dinner in February that went well and my brother called me a couple times to catch up But their baby was born last month and it s like nothing changed I asked him to meet my nephew he refused and said he would call me when they got out of the hospital That was a month ago they went home three weeks ago and I haven t had any news since then When my mom asked if they needed anything they said she couldn t come to see them because they don t have enough chairs My mom only saw her first grandchild once Now she asks me to act like everything is okay because of my brother s sensitivity and that he doesn t talk to me because I scare him since our argument at christmas and my husband doesn t want to see my brother because of the way he treated us at our wedding I don t know what to do Should I keep trying to maintain some kind of bond I feel like I m chasing someone who doesn t want me in their life and it breaks my heart because he s my only sibling",29,Male,brother

text body: My sister 43f and I 40f are probably the closest of our 6 siblings I ve always felt we share a deeper connection compared to our other siblings and I ve always come to her with my problems However my current issue with her is difficult to discuss because it will hurt her Two years ago my sister had an online affair I knew about it but didn t encourage her to pursue it beyond online conversations They exchanged photos and she bought him gifts Though I suspected he was using her I felt powerless to say anything I knew she wouldn t listen The affair ended after a couple of months when her husband discovered it Since then our relationship has changed Recently while staying at her place to visit her and her children whom I m very close to we discussed what happened She implied that I should have done more to stop her from talking to this guy Her husband has also been distant believing I had an obligation to tell him about the affair She seems to blame me for not intervening but even when I did speak up like when I told her she was overreacting about this guy cheating on her with someone else she wouldn t listen I reminded her that they weren t in a real relationship and that he was likely trying to get money from her but she remained upset about the cheating During our conversation I learned that her husband had hit her several times after discovering the affair When I pointed out the irony of her husband expecting me to tell him about the affair while I m supposed to stay quiet about his violence my sister defended him saying she deserved it This shocked me deeply I don t know how to maintain our relationship anymore She s changed since the affair ended and her belief that she deserved to be hit disturbs me though I didn t show it at the time While I m close to her children and feel like their second mother I can t maintain the same closeness with my sister I don t want to cut ties completely but I can t be as close as we once were I m at a loss about how to move forward questioning whether I should have told her husband about the affair and whether I m somehow at fault",40,Female,sister

author: Head_Track_3523
text body: Hi Reddit I m looking for some honest advice or perspective on a family situation that s been weighing on me I have a younger sister she s 17 now and our relationship is really tense Recently she s been saying that I traumatized her growing up and that she resents me for it She gets triggered by almost everything I say or do and often lashes out at me with a lot of anger or rudeness When I try to address it her response is basically You caused me trauma so I have every right to feel this way and act this way toward you To be fair yes we used to fight a lot as kids I ll own that some of the things I said or did were wrong I was a kid too and I ve worked on myself since then I ve changed a lot and don t behave the way I used to I m not making excuses but I m not the same person I was at 12 or 15 What s hard is that it feels like she s weaponizing the past to justify her current behavior She expects to be treated like she s still 10 and can say or do anything without being called out But she s 17 now and I think she needs to start being accountable for how she treats people too I also suspect there s some jealousy at play My older sister and I are close in age so naturally we hang out more go to bars clubs events talk about things that are relevant to people in their 20s I think that makes my younger sister feel left out and it just adds fuel to her anger toward me What really hit me is that I overheard her talking to her therapist and she said she genuinely hates me What s kind of ironic is that I barely even live at home For the past 4 years I m usually away for university in another city far away and spent the whole of last year living in another country I barely had any communication with her during that time I m only back this summer because of an internship and even then I m working most of the time But ever since I got back she s been cold rude and constantly lashing out I m trying to be understanding but I also feel like I m being treated unfairly for things that happened years ago while any effort I make now gets dismissed I want to make things better but I also don t want to keep absorbing anger I don t think I fully deserve This is also the first time ever that she s bringing up that I caused her trauma and she s always constantly bringing up the past and getting angry over it Has anyone else dealt with something similar How do I show empathy without enabling hurtful behavior And how do I set boundaries with a sibling who sees me as a villain Any advice would be really appreciated Thanks for reading Edit final It seems like many people here have had really painful or even traumatic experiences with their own siblings Some middle aged commenters seem to think I m their bully I m still really young or that this is their story and it seems like they re taking that pain out in here I truly wish them peace and hope they re able to heal and this helped them get stuff out of their chest But my story is not like yours or the same scenarios To everyone else thank you for your advice I genuinely just want peace and in the future I don t want to have a bad or non existing relationship So I ll be having a conversation with my sister to understand her perspective and try to make things right I won t be checking or responding to this thread any further",,,sibling

author: Clear-Telephone-3212
text body: Trigger warning child abuse and SA I need advice regarding a complicated situation with my in laws Going to try to keep this as vague as possible for reasons that will become evident This will also probably be long because without all the context my dilemma doesn t really make sense It seems straight forward but it doesn t feel like it is All the context will help explain my various reservations One of my spouse s siblings is the outcast of the family This is a family where some of the siblings can admit their parents ventured into physically and emotionally abusive territory when they were younger I ve heard various stories from various people some of the siblings downplay it so I m not 100 sure about the extent of it but it was at least worse than your average strict religious boomer parent Bad enough that my spouse says other strict religious parents didn t want their kids spending the nights there Yet most of the siblings have a better relationship with their parent than they do each other In my opinion all of their kids need therapy Though none of them believe in it I won t say they re all bad people but I wouldn t be surprised if their all their exes started a support group I say all that to give some perspective on the one single outcast child They ve been rejected and shunned by their parents and their siblings just kind of followed suit over a decade ago when most of them were just becoming young adults Again being vague on purpose but it was a shitty reason to shun your kid It wasnt justified But like I said all the siblings need therapy and I have to have my guard up around all of them all the time so it s not like the outcast is the one innocent and well adjusted kid out of the bunch Before the ousted sibling OS from here on out tried to get back in contact with the rest of the siblings I was told stories portraying them as manipulative unwell and a pathological liar My spouse was honest about why the parents wanted nothing to do with them and it was a bs reason and I felt awful for them Considering the parental shunning and traumatic childhood the shitty behaviors I heard about made sense but I also took those stories with a grain of salt Biased storytellers and all that When I first met OS they were incredibly kind It was nice meeting and I was glad I could have a genuinely good relationship with at least one of my in laws They did share some problematic stories about family members like anecdotes about them being racist when they were kids but having known those specific people for a few years the stories didn t at all surprise me Not that they had been blatantly racist in front of me before but just things Id picked up on at some family gatherings So I believed them but also felt like they only shared the stories in an attempt to further alienate me from their family so they d be certain they d have an ally in me The way and timing the stories were slipped into conversation felt like they were weapoinizing a family history of racism against my race to manipulate me into being on their side not because they were genuinely trying to warn me or anything This pattern continued Whenever I said anything remotely positive about a family member OS had some sort of horrible story about them If I ever gave a sibling the benefit of the doubt even over something as small as not staying in touch enough after reconnecting OS would one up themselves with another anecdote of said sibling being a shitty person so that I couldn t possibly defend them Again these kids are all the product of their traumatic childhood so the stories were always believable But timing was just always convenient OS only pulled out these stories if it seemed like I wasn t siding with them or didn t dislike someone enough Like I said my spouse told me beforehand OS was a pathological liar and I did catch them in some lies occasionally Like pretending to be at a place to gain pity when they weren t even in the state They had told siblings they d been involved in covert ops or high profile assignments I d also caught them sharing private information I trusted them with with their estranged siblings they hardly spoke to so I know now they aren t the confidant they said they were and to keep myself guarded around them I took a big step back from talking to them but am still here if they need me And that is why I am struggling with this latest revelation OS recently told me one of their siblings sexually assaulted them when they were kids This is a sibling that recently has been really involved in the family and trying to bring everyone together They are the one sibling every other siblings gets along with They tried to reconnect with OS recently both were open to it but both said it didn t go well The Accused because OS was up to the same old shit and tried say they were involved in secret missions or whatever when they were catching up OS just said Accused Sibling AS was still a dick Following the usual formula OS told me the story about the assaulted after I had mentioned AS having a more active role in our lives which makes sense Finding out your loved ones are getting closer to your abuser may make you feel like you should tell them the person they re letting into their life is a monster In addition to OS being r ped idk if reddit requires censoring by their sibling they shared that they were punished when they tried to seek help from their parents as a child They said their dad called them all sorts of horrible things and then as additional punishment turned them over to the deacons I knew their dad was physically and emotionally abusive throughout their childhood He s mellowed out in his old age but the past abuse is why we don t really leave our children alone with him But what OS said is a whole other level That is dark and twisted and evil Based on what OS recently told me I obviously do not want my children around their grandparents or AS I asked OS if they d ever share this with their siblings and they said no and that I better never tell my spouse either which I completely understand and immediately told them it s not my trauma to share But what do I do when my spouse wants to know why I don t want their family around our kids Despite the abusive childhood they have a decent relationship with their parents and they have helped us out when we re in need and been great grandparents to our children My spouse is also closer to AS than they are to any of the other siblings If I put my foot down and say they re not allowed around our kids anymore for seemingly no good reason my spouse simply won t have it It Will probably result in a divorce because from their point of view I m just randomly deciding to permanently keep our kids away from their family If I betrayed OS s trust and told my spouse what they shared with me all hell would break loose There s a decent chance my spouse wouldn t believe OS due to their history of lying and manipulation If so they d probably be furious OS is accusing AS of such things and would probably tell AS or confide in a different sibling As a result OS would probably end up being confronted of verbally attacked harassed by at least one of their siblings That s not something any victim should have to go through The only way to keep the peace maintain my marriage and respect OS s privacy is to do absolutely nothing at all and let AS and their parents around my kids They re also our default babysitter on the extremely rare occasion we need one Obviously I m not comfortable with that I am unwilling to sacrifice my children s safety for anything or anyone I couldn t live with myself if something happened to them and it was completely preventable because I knew better So what do I do I feel like I only have bad options If the allegations are true I know my spouse with side with me and keep the kids far away But the truth of this family s history is so muddled and they were honestly too young when most of it went down to even have any idea of how dark their family history could be I want to be there for emotional support for OS but this secret the trauma they ve shared with me and my promise to keep their secret will probably result in the dissolution of my marriage And I also can t protect the kids from my in laws if we re divorced and sharing custody and it feels so selfish to think about it in those terms but I don t know what to do now TLDR Sibling in law shared they were assaulted by a sibling and church deacons at the invitation of their dad as a child They re also known as a pathological liar and pot stirrer so unsure if my spouse would believe me even if I told them but sibling in law also specifically told me not to How do I protect my kids from the alleged abusers without destroying my marriage for denying spouse s family access to kids for seemingly no reason Can t protect them if we re divorced",,,parent

each other says so when a possibilities presenting itself they take absolute caution for that to to happen because in their eyes a possibility is a reality and that possibility is high in their eyes no matter how low it s like it presents a threat someone presented with these suggestions I m scared of my own family what they will do to me if I show any further defiance anger is not tolerated that s the last thing you want to do in the household about being terminated I haven t done anything bad since 5th grade two years without anything and they say I m too violent I m too unstable I fight too many people it s been 2 years 2 years since I ever did anything I went past the radar but what I got in return was a slap to the face with insults that can make anybody commit suicide especially by your own family it hurts I understand the strict household it gets to a point where I think they don t understand me be thinking some criminals they think I m some bandit that s going to be homeless begging on the street smoking cocaine Our tradition is submission and absolute obedience towards elders no questions no nothing and anything interpreted as defiance will be thought as you being somebody in crime it s like you committed a felony I m not overreacting I m telling you what is happening from the past years I ve been here and I can only express this through messages as nobody else in my family would understand I don t possess the amount of Haitian words to express what I m feeling I understand strictness but when the strictness goes to the point where you are assuming that I m going to fight a police officer just because I refused to give a phone makes me really concerned that they would put more assumptions on me I just want to grow up faster and leave I want to become my own person I want to become my own successful person I m defiant of course there s no doubting yet I have taken multiple scoldings they got more harsh it has gotten to the point where I don t even listen to them anymore where did they get the new fighting a sheriff and me getting deported is it because what and the downside is there like I come from a Haitian household which is both a very bad thing and a very good thing depending on what type of parents you have they told me I was useless in Haitian they told me I belong in Haiti they told me I m already spoiled I m rotten I m nothing I belong in Haiti to eat s I m not even making that up I m not saying that out of furious they said it and I have nobody else to talk to inside I m asking what did I do wrong because this is all started they forced me to put on something it was really uncomfortable but they forced it on me anyways didn t allow me to express my emotions it was pent up they wouldn t understand it feels like the school s more home than my house at this point does it make any sense at this point if I m not needed or wanted why should I be here definition why not sending me to someplace else to not be defiant I always knew my family has a very toxic family when it comes to verbal abuse and my pants are the type of parents to take a defiant act as something that can make me go in prison in the future they don t acknowledge my anger they don t acknowledge anything the only acknowledge of how I m a selfish kid they don t find the deeper crevices they just see the surface as assumptions are made such as when I m in the future I m going to fight an officer and get arrested was there assumption because I didn t want to give the phone and because of that thought that I would slap them and punch them in the face they never see the real potential in me they just want me to die did I say that in a literal sense because they said that more times than I can count and my mom being the goody Two Shoes she is my mom would tell my family which is a fatal mistake to me because they grow up off obedience obedience is what they want they don t care how you feel I have to learn that the hard way you don t care what age I was they said I was crazy they said I was mentally unstable they said I can kill people and I was only 7 to 4 at the time I was different I was not obedient I was questioning when I told you they re verbal abuse was not holding back they said insults like I was a grown person although they did not do it when I seek advice all I got was go with the flow almost committed suicide was thinking about it one time I understand the need for discipline and respect but the words that they say to me is extremely harsh I wish they just understand me more there s some days I just cry internally as I go to sleep my mother can t say anything my family gives her the perception of I m a very bad kid that causes defiance I hope this message serves you well please just try to be as nice as possible even if it s hard you re not the only one out there peace out",12,,

author: Chubby-Labrador
text body: Looking to see if my feelings are valid and for advice for what I can say to my mom Shortened if you can believe it because 37 years of drama is a lot to type out My 33f half brother 37m has failed to launch into adulthood We were raised together by our mom 74f and my dad 81m who raised my brother as his own once they were married when my brother was 3 We were raised with the same opportunities We grew up in an affluent area went to great public schools and our parents had the funds to send us each to college without needing to take on debt He was never interested in school Flunked out his freshman year in high school parents sent him to a boarding school for troubled teens that he flunked out of after a year he went back to our local high school where he was kicked out for flipping a desk at a teacher was then sent to a neighboring high school where he didn t graduate My parents eventually held his hand long enough for him to get his GED when he was 24 or 25 He spent from age 18 to 30 living in my parents basement either living off of them getting social security or working an entry level job and either getting fired or quitting by not showing up At 30 he got his girlfriend who also lived in the basement pregnant The deal with my parents was that they would find a place to live before the baby was born They did not and brought the baby back to the basement to live My mom took the baby away in the first week when she heard my nieces mom screaming at her to shut up when my niece was crying My mom has a rental property about an hour from where they live Eventually they came to the conclusion that my brother and his girlfriend were not going to look for a place to live so my mom evicted her tenants from her rental property they fixed up the house and moved my brother and his family in when my niece was 6mo The deal was that each of them would pay my mom 500 per month in rent totaling about half of market rent for the area His girlfriend did not last long in the home before she left with the baby and started a custody battle My parents paid for my brother s lawyer and he ended up with full custody and his ex bounced out of his daughter s life and has never returned I believe he receives less than 100 per month in child support My niece is now 6 My brother is no longer working or receiving any income other than child support He spends his days sleeping and his nights gaming He said he cannot drive for Uber any more because his car is making a noise He has stopped paying his 500 per month in rent My mom has made several upgrades to his home to make it more comfortable for the two of them My mom pays his bills she does his yard work takes care of his mail and pays for my nieces babysitter She picks my niece up every Friday and takes her for the weekend and all holidays and drops her off at school on Monday She goes over every Wednesday to do homework with her she does her laundry buys all of her clothes and school uniforms pays for her health insurance and manages her doctors appointments she bathes her and does her hair on the weekends She spends every summer with my parents where my mom pays for her camp she spends winter breaks with my parents and goes camping with them on spring and fall breaks Santa knows to visit my parents house because that s where he can find my niece and my mom takes care of her birthdays My brother does not bathe her regularly make sure she changes her clothes or underwear does not make sure she brushes her teeth or hair or make sure she goes to bed on time He doesn t sit down to do homework with her or keep snacks in the house for her He recently said he thinks she can just come home on her own if she has her own house key and take care of herself while he s not home and she doesn t need supervision I have received alI of the information about my brother from my mom since around 2016 I RARELY speak to him I went NC LC after graduating from college Not because of his failure to launch but because he was emotionally and verbally abusive to all of us when I was growing up and did not stop when I moved back home after college so I left and went NC LC I speak to him when I see him rarely at my parent s house He was invited and attended my wedding and he is invited to my home every Christmas Eve He has been blocked on my phone and all forms of social media for years but I maintain a great relationship with my niece and talk to her multiple times a week when she s with my mom I also see her frequently when I go to my parents house I was talking to my mom yesterday and she said that she told him she would not be able to support two households for much longer She said she has no time for her own life or responsibilities She has said she would cut him off SEVERAL times in the past so I do not believe this time will be any different He knows how to get what he wants from her He knows she will never let him or his daughter be homeless and he is taking full advantage My husband and I are expecting our first baby in October and after our combined parental leave is finished my mom has agreed to watch our baby three days a week at my parents home My mom has a history of spending the majority of her time and energy focused on my brother and niece My brother and I each live an hour away from our parents in opposite directions She travels to my brother s house multiple times a week and has said I live too far away to visit She only comes over for Christmas Eve or Thanksgiving and cannot find my home on her own without getting lost We have lived in the same home for 7 years When I was getting married she did not want to help with anything other the finances they agreed to pay for my dress and the caterer In the past few years I have struggled with cancer and infertility and she never wanted to visit me in the hospital or help me through recovery She only offered to help financially which was very kind and we are thankful for they paid for our IVF medication after insurance Her justification for helping with our IVF meds was because she helped my brother buy a new truck that has poor gas mileage so he cannot use it for Uber When I asked if she could visit me in the hospital to meet our baby when he arrives she grimaced at the idea and said it depends on where I give birth When she found I would be giving birth less than 10 minutes from her home she said oh okay I think so I have a suspicion she will back out of helping us with childcare due to her being too busy managing my brother s life and raising my niece I grew up being extremely close to my maternal grandma and want the same experience for my kids I feel like they will never be a priority compared to my brother and my niece I also feel like I am responsible for my own relationship with my parents They do not reach out to me unless they need either my help or my husbands and they do not visit They come to me for all computer or phone help and ask my husband for any heavy lifting help they need They do not ask my brother for any help because he is so unreliable and annoying I do not want to be entirely responsible for my children s relationship with my parents if that makes sense I want them to want to be involved in my kids lives Am I right to feel like my parents mainly my mom s lives revolve around my brother and that he s taking advantage of them It feels like my parents have bounced me out of their lives because I have successfully launched into adulthood and they don t need want to worry about me I don t know how to verbalize my thoughts about their priorities and concerns about their relationships with my future kids not being important to them TLDR Brother has failed to launch and had a child Parents enable behavior and coddle to brothers every need OP feels like second thought after successfully launch into adulthood",33,Female,sister

133,Unemployed abusive father,"title: Unemployed abusive father
author: euphoric_reverie
text body: Hi everyone I don t normally post on Reddit but I just wanted to share my story about my family Unfortunately this might be a long one My dad lost his job soon after I was born leaving my mom to financially support the whole family For my entire childhood he did nothing except surf the web read write about his early life drink beer and criticize others He would often tell me that he quit his job so that he could devote his life to the upbringing of his children but that isn t true He got fired and he was emotionally and physically abusive He would always tell me however that he was a good father and that my life was easy compared to his He didn t let me brush my own teeth until I turned 11 He told me that if he let me do that I would have cavities in all of my teeth He would threaten me and also disable the wifi for the whole house if I didn t let him brush my teeth It sounds stupid but even if I did it on my own and told him he would tell me that he would need to do it too By the way I had to get 4 of my teeth filled when I was 7 When I was little about 2 years old my parents had maids take care of me while they were at work Around that time I developed very compulsive behaviors such as eating hair and other ones that I will not refer to I also stopped being able to sleep at night and even to this day I am afraid to go to bed I just turned 20 and I have been in college away from home for 2 years I have been suspecting CSA for a while because something is not right I ended up asking my father about this recently and he admitted that he had heard that some of the maids touched the kids in a very inappropriate way to get them to sleep My parents never bothered to investigate this When I was in grade 3 I suffered from terrible nausea I don t know why but around that time a boy in school had a crush on me and I liked him back I felt that it was so wrong because love in my family didn t mean warm hugs and kind words it was control The word love to me was when my dad cut my cookies in half because eating the whole thing was too many calories and he wanted me to be healthy And then behind my back he would eat the whole box in one sitting So I was terrified of this boy I remember he tried to hold my hand once and he would always walk back to class with me It was actually very cute But at the time I thought that he might hurt me like how my dad did so I didn t admit that I liked him I still have my diary from that year and the only page where I referred to my feelings was on the last one I said that I only liked him a little bit I read through the whole thing again recently and it just made me sad because I was just a child I was chubby I couldn t do math I wouldn t eat my veggies and I hated playing soccer but I just wanted to be loved like everyone else I would only get scraps of affection from my parents and I thought that it was normal Around this time I was unable to finish my dinner I would ask my parents if I could leave the table and I would go and sit in the backyard and cry I would also cry to my parents every night and tell them that I felt so sick They would ignore me Then I started telling them to just let me die That got their attention but they did not comfort me They are both very emotionally detached Instead they sent me to the doctor The tests came back and everything was normal So they sent me to the counsellor The counsellor told my parents that she suspected I had gone through trauma and asked if they wanted me to be screened for it My parents told her no our daughter doesn t have trauma and just left me to figure out my problems Although my dad was the controlling one in the family I was deathly afraid of my mom I would have recurring nightmares where there were three of her standing in our living room trying to chase me There would also be dreams where she would be in my room looking at me while I was sleeping and she only had half a face There was a mom at my elementary school who had the same haircut as her and I was terrified of her I would avoid her at all costs I hated the movie Coraline and I had to cover my eyes when I watched it My dad plotted my weight and height on a chart until I was 15 He did this with my younger sister too but she would always lie to him and he would never tell her that she was overweight As a teenager he would always tell me that I was overweight and that I would underperform in track and swimming because I had so much excess fat I had a BMI of 18 0 Looking back at old photos I was built like a stick too I had significant body image issues and disordered eating as a result of this I would make myself run 10km every day and I would skip breakfast and lunch I would never lie to him about my weight and height because he told me that he was doing it because he was a loving father But he never told me that he loved me or that he was proud of me He hit me multiple times throughout my life and was proud to announce it at famiIy gatherings or whenever my mom had friends over he has very few friends My mom stopped letting him eat dinner with her friends because he would usually say something rude about the cooking or drink too much The summer after I graduated high school and turned 18 I made more plans with my friends because I was moving to a different city for college I stayed out late one night because I was visiting the night market There were no boys there was no alcohol nothing wild at all just me and five friends buying as much food as we could with hardly any money I have always been a diligent student and I received many academic awards did well on all my AP exams and had gotten into a top uni for physics I had agreed with my parents that I might be back very late because it was a long commute back home I arrived home at about 2 AM and quietly went to bed I was texting my friend for about half an hour on my new phone My parents didn t allow me to have a phone until I turned 18 Up until the end of high school I had a designated screentime that was 5 6 PM every day I had to beg for extra time if I had homework or exams to study for I must ve been giggling to myself because I accidentally woke up my dad and he came into my room He immediately began looking for things to confiscate He would usually take away my laptop so I couldn t do my homework But that night for some reason I blurted out that he just couldn t take any of my things He came over to me and slapped me across the face Hard And then he walked out I felt that sting for a very long time and I will never forget the look in his eyes He didn t love me He wanted to hurt me Just two months prior to that I had shown up to the dinner table in a tank top and shorts Nothing scandalous at all it was normal attire for a high school girl who had just come back from her afternoon run My dad looked at me and told me that he couldn t bear to see me like that and told me to get out of his house So I got out I was walking around the streets for hours until my mom let me in when he was asleep When I went into the kitchen for a snack I hadn t had anything to eat I found that he had thrown away my dinner When I was 16 I had an argument with him which resulted in him grabbing onto my arm twisting it and dragging me across the floor He also broke a door in my house because I had locked myself in there due to being scared of him and he basically just kicked it down I have not been home for about a year I am now living alone in the city where I go to uni My sister was my best friend growing up and now we have not spoken because our relationship has been strained due to my poor relationship with my father He has never once hit her or slapped her I still text both of my parents I m not sure why I still bother with my dad I think that it is time to cut ties with him but I guess a small part of me is still looking for approval from him I know I ll never get it though My dad has a very detached way of speaking He never tells people that he is happy for them he never congratulates anyone for hard work and derives some sort of satisfaction from tearing others down I finished my second year of physics this year with a very strong GPA and I was offered my second research internship as well He told me to not get so complacent and that internships meant nothing He said that a monkey could do what I did He did not wish me a happy 20th birthday and I of course was never expecting him to do so because he forgot my 16th and also cancelled Christmas that year I am not joking he yelled at me on Christmas morning for waking him up I was downstairs cooking breakfast for the whole family and then told everyone that nobody could open presents I ve never forgotten his birthday I have bought him birthday gifts and Christmas presents I may be earning barely above minimum wage as a uni student who works full time in the summer but he has not worked for the past 20 years Just the other day I suggested to my mom that he seemed somewhat detached and rude over text and I said that not even my manager supervisor at work was that blunt She ended up telling him that which was not what I intended at all He responded like this to me I m going to cut back on the use of WhatsApp between us because Mom suggests you feel strongly that I am denigrating your activities I will go back to email which I feel suits my style better It s in the nature of WhatsApp that messages must be abrupt I can t pound out long messages with my finger and I suppose you find direct factual messages too rude or blunt That message is not obviously an abusive one but I just cannot help but feel that many people would have instead said Sorry I ve made you feel that way instead of blaming the mode of communication WhatsApp and suggesting that it s my issue for finding direct factual messages to be rude That s his normal way of communicating To this day I struggle a lot with socializing I have had many close friends in my life but I have had very few surface level friends I cannot make small talk for some reason and other people tend to see me as someone they can open up to Of course I am more than happy that people are comfortable speaking their mind with me I love to help my friends and make sure that they feel appreciated and listened to because I know exactly what it s like to cry extra loudly in my room and to have nobody come up to me and ask me if I m doing ok But I have recently been feeling very drained because many people use me as an unpaid therapist and sometimes I really just want to invite someone to grab a bubble tea with me I don t really want to unpack their childhood trauma on a casual Tuesday afternoon especially since I have been through things too Of course I want the best for them and I will support them but I ve basically reached my limit I have never been in a romantic relationship because I feel very insecure about my family background and I still feel like that little girl that I was when that boy liked her in grade 3 I feel nauseous I feel like I can t trust anyone I poured myself into my academics my job and my research into helping my friends and now I m just the girl who s too busy to do things that make me happy I haven t smiled in a long time I m very grateful that I got to leave home for uni and I would never go back but I m 20 I shouldn t be this stressed out I should be living But I m not I never go to parties I feel like I m not good enough to date I feel that nobody can really love me The worst part is that I don t even care sometimes I went years of being controlled monitored but not appreciated for being the messy imperfect kid that I was Only people at school saw it I ve tried therapy before without much success I was grateful that I got to vent to someone but I feel that I just didn t even scratch the surface of everything Sorry if this post seems kind of all over the place I wrote it all in one go and I just sort of let everything come out I just wanted to put it out here in case someone else has had a similar experience or can provide insight Thanks for reading TD LR My dad is emotionally and physically abusive He has been unemployed for my entire life and he controlled me by measuring my weight and height until 15 kicking me out of the house slapping me in the face criticizing my clothing not allowing me to have a phone confiscating my belongings and disabling the wifi for everyone at home",20,,

text body: I met my stepmom when I was 8 My parents custody agreement was I went with my dad Saturday 8am to 8pm It was supposed to be 50 50 but my stepmom threw a fit to my dad that once a week was more than enough I was actively being abused at home by my mom s bf and told my stepmom several times She d use what I said as drama When I saw her on the weekends with her two daughters it was rare She convinced my dad to switch his custody to once a month so they could have their Saturdays back Our one Saturday a month my brother and I we d just sit at his apartment all day I found out this was bc my stepmom said he couldn t waste money on us When I did see her we d go on an activity My brother and I would be neglected the whole time if my dad was there She d refuse to buy us food but get her kids food and say they couldn t share Through all of this everything she did she did with a smile and she had a way of making you feel bad for even asking When I was 12 I was rescued from my mom s home by my grandma Of course my dad s gf threw a fit about me living with them so I lived with my grandma for years hoping one day he d change his mind My grandma knew the issues with my stepmom and insisted I don t live with her But when I was 16 I was in a LDR and I thought if I moved with my dad I could finally have freedom to speak with him and see him in person I convinced my dad I could move in the summer after 9th grade He agreed I could continue going to my same school and he d drive me When she found out she came completely unglued Within a week of he being there she threw me out of the house a dozen times told me to unalive myself and I slept at the church up the street in the grass basically the whole summer When school started she would rage if my dad got up to take me to school or picked me up She said I needed to be paying for gas Bc of this I had to take the public bus Every week she was upset if my dad gave me bus money saying I should be working by now Same with lunch money She had a EBT card and even though she got tons of food every month for FREE she d write her name on everything saying I couldn t have it only her and her kids My dad would buy me the breakfast sandwiches once in a blue moon but she would end up eating them all She d call me selfish greedy and a liar constantly If she was upset with me she d take the cords to the WiFi box tv and my flip phone This became a regular thing and she d keep the cords in her car unless she was home Everyday I d do homework at the school library for hours and come home I d come home to an empty house with a note saying to clean the whole house And I d have to She s come home at 11 1am and do an inspection If one thing was out of place she d pound down my door and pull me out of bed As far as school if I stayed home that day i wasn t allowed to stay home ever She d come in my room screaming rip the covers off dump a cup of cold water on me and push me out the door throwing my backpack out on the ground The work around for this was I d have my bf call my school and call in so I could stay home without my parents being notified I d hide under my bed or leave to the public library for the day When I was working I d have to walk to and from work even though my manager expressed to me several times I needed a ride home as I was getting off at 10pm As far as clothes she said I was wasting the 20 cash I was allowed for back to school clothes mind you I d have to trek 2 hrs to the nearest target and back home jus to spend it while her children were given a 1500 allowance each for clothes My birthdays were ignored every year and she d convince my father to do nothing and I d be home alone all day I couldn t do any sports or have friends bc she d refuse to give me a ride My senior year I was never home Sleeping in my car friends house school or work 24 7 As far as food my two stepsisters were taken out to eat breakfast lunch and dinner seven days a week while at home I was expected to pick around the house and find whatever canned food I could eat Things change the last year of me being there because I got my first big girl job and I started working all of the time I would work 16 hour shifts on the weekends and on school days work eight hours When I finished high school she insisted that I should pay the market value of rent in our area and that she wanted about 2000 a month I would like to add that in addition to everything else that was going on I was doing 4 to 6 hours of chores every single day She refused to clean or make her kids clean insisting that I was home all the time mostly because I was never included in anything and if I was home I should be cleaning My long distance boyfriend came to visit me during this time and things didn t end up working out I was devastated because he was my way out of this house He was well over 18 had an apartment and we had plans that I was gonna move in with him once I finished high school Because of this she started really resenting me since she wanted me out the same day of graduation I evened up moving in with my now husbands family after explaining the situation Through all of this I was a straight A child extremely well mannered and never making trouble She two daughters are 18 and 23 now The older one is in and out of prison and a drug addict still living at home The 18yr old smokes parties and is a dropout I find it crazy the polar opposite we are and that I was always seen as the bad child My stepmom and I have been no contact for a few months I m 25 now and she s continuing to be disrespectful to not just myself by my in laws This branched off to my now toddler and I had enough Idk if anyone else had a stepmom like this but I m not the only one who s said she s not nice I

text body: I have been super close with my family my whole life Especially my mom and little sibling My little sibling as been my best friend since we re close in age and we ve just always been bonded When we d go out people were call us the duo They know everything about me they ve gotten me through so much and vise versa I moved out of my house about a year and half ago I moved 1 000 miles away to be with my long term partner It was a really hard decision but my sibling and I had a lot of really healthy conversations about it to make sure we d both be okay I try to visit my family twice a year I ve been lucky to visit them three times already thanks to a bonus trip Up until recently my sibling and I have been doing really good we have weekly calls to catch up we text everyday we are always sending each other tiktoks Things started to shift when they started to go into the dating scene They started flirting with a ton of people and even got into a really unhealthy relationship that only lasted a little bit I tried to have a conversation with them about how I was worried they were being reckless and maybe having some unhealthy habits They seemed really understanding and the conversation went great Suddenly though they stopped putting as much effort into talking with me They stopped reposting things on tiktoks about sisterhood they stopped telling me about people they re dating it s a fight to get them to call me when they do call they won t tell me anything about their life even if I try asking questions I ve been trying to plan a trip for them to come visit me because I ve lived here for a year and a half my family had never visited me suddenly they aren t sure they want to come down The thing that really pushed me over the edge was they recently reposted a TikTok about their new best friend It was about how their future kids will know her as the cool fun aunt even though they re not related This kinda stung because we had an on going joke we were the cool fun aunts for our current niece and we were a duo who would get her into trouble by giving her too much candy So for my sibling to suddenly be distant to me and to repost that about someone else kinda just broke me When I brought it to them trying to explain how it hurt they started acting as if I was dramatic and toxic for being jealous of their friend I tried to tell them I wasn t jealous and I was really happy they found a new friend to be with while I m away that it just stung but they continued to call me dramatic My mom did the same thing She even guilt tripped me by saying I should be happy they have a new friend since I decided to leave them and how they struggled without me I once again tried to explain it has nothing to do with the friend but rather the little efforts they are all putting in to see me or talk to me Now I feel like maybe I m being dramatic and if I should just drop it I don t know why but them reposting that aunt tiktok really felt like a knife in my back I watched it and laughed I even liked it before realizing it said even though we re not related and it wasn t about me TLDR My sibling and I were super close They suddenly started to put less effort into talking with me or trying to see me after I had a discussion on them being unhealthy in relationships They then went on to repost a TikTok that was an inside joke for us but about their friend They started to call me dramatic and jealous alongside my mom for being upset about them not making efforts to talk to me or visit me",,Female,sister

weekend or anytime we were invited to an event since he was an angry drunk My mom sister and I would have to hide from him he wouldn t hit us but would punch walls and scream terrible things and would have to hide the car keys from him so he wouldn t drive off and put someone else s life in danger i remember one christmas we were in the living room and my dad was drunk and angry at my mom cause me and my sister were crying terrified at him but he thought my mom was trying to scare us on purpose so he grabbed the christmas tree and knocked it down the tree me and my sister loved putting up every year and i could vividly remember seeing the tree go down and a santa ornament shattering on the floor it was santa claus on a swing Even when he was sober he was a mean person he has so much hatred towards my 3 half siblings i forget we re half siblings and just call them my regular siblings One time my parents were going to some event and one of my half sisters who was like 16 at the time was upset cause she had to babysit me and my biological sister so my dad got mad at starting hitting her hard with a belt she is not his biological daughter and it was traumatizing having to see that i understand that kind of discipline is normalized in mexican households but i could see he did it out of anger and hatred and yes everything i am talking about is and was tolerated by my mother she d yell at him but that s the most she d do my half brother always tried staying on my dads good side but for some reason my dad just doesn t like my half siblings One time my dad was drunk he literally threatened to kill my brother just because he took a while to unlock the front door for us after coming home from a cook out This is actually very nasty but at my old house i had to share a room with my biological sister and parents my sister had a bed and my parents had their own bed while i slept on the floor One morning I sit up and when I turn towards my parents bed and look up I literally see them having sex mind you my sisters bed was right next to theirs she would ve saw the whole things the moment she d open her eyes My dad would also touch my mom provocatively in front of us as well when we were little girls did they think we wouldn t remember He also to this day has a bad p rn addiction we all shared one computer and every time i d open it i d just see naked women i tried looking up ponies because i was like 6 and a p rn website was pre typed after i put po Also when we were at the beach he would use the camera we took for family photos to record women in bikinis on the beach This is why I ve never and will never bring my female friends near him As my two half siblings started getting older my dad would kick them out multiple times One day I came home from school and noticed my half sister wasn t home the one my dad hit with a belt and me and my bio sister started crying because my half sister and brother literally were our second parents i consider my brother a much better father figure than my own dad My dad got annoyed because me and my sister would stop crying WE WERE CHILDREN and he threatened to leave us and find a family that would actually love him He literally manipulated us at 6 and 8 years old He was jealous of my half siblings and wanted my mom all to himself about 2 years ago my bio sister passed away it was and still is the worst thing our family has ever been through at the time and point my half siblings are in their 30s and have their own families we all tried changing for the better since this really opened up our eyes My dad s health wasn t so great He s diabetic and from the stress he currently has an hemorrhage in one of his eyes Due to his diabetes and medication he can no longer drink nor become erect he doesn t speak english so i unfortunately had to translate that to him because it can potentially kill him His health changed but his personality never changed he is still a miserable and hateful man 4 months after my sister passed we found out he was having an affair with his ex girlfriend in mexico and went to see her on a trip once when he went alone Everything my dad does disgust me at this point he s unhygienic doesn t clean up after himself and doesn t flush the toilet all the way he literally waits all day until my mom gets home to work because refuses to cook he says he ll change but if he really wanted he would ve done it by now i think the universe tried bringing me a guy just like him my ex into my life as a test and realized just in time that i could ve potentially repeated the same story with my parents and broke up with him there is so much more i could ve mentioned but it would ve been an extremely long read i thank those who read towards the end cause it feels so good letting

text body: The main reason why is because he s only 19 and i think is too young to get married they have no money to move out they ve only been together 1 year and her parents don t approve of their relationship About 9 months ago her parents forced them to seperate because they wanted her to focus on her career and not socializing They confiscated her phone and made her cut ties with him She finally got back in touch with him and feels bad about the abrupt ending She said her parents don t want them to be together she wants more freedom but they want her to just work I overheard them talking she said the only way she could get any freedom is if she got married and maybe they d start treating her like an adult He told me she s not allowed to speak to him and her parents might get mad My son took that as her saying they should get married He s talking abotu seeing signs like seeing 222 everywhere It makes perfect sense to him He thinks this is what will rescue his girlfriend from her family and let them be together I don t like his girlfriend so much if i m being honest Plus Her parents likely are not gonna let them be together I think he can do better She was always asking for money got him to throw a birthday party for her when he had no money he spent his birthday money on her and bought her takeout I think she s using him And i just feel like that there s more to the story of why her parents have so little trust in her i ve talked to her mom a few times and she s never told me exactly what she did to lose their trust I ve just seen some signs but my son says i m projecting Her mom doesn t seem that bad when i ve interacted with her Plus she has a sister who her mom isn t as strict with it s just his GF I want him to think about this in the long term and not just impulsively jump into this because he wants to see his girlfriend more How can i talk to him about this",,Female,mother

text body: I grew up with a lot of siblings most of them younger My dad kind of wasn t really the best father even though he was supportive at times The marriage with my mom never seemed really genuine even when I was little and when we were in our early 30s they finally got divorced My mom and dad stayed friends for awhile My mom remarried shortly after and my dad had been in several relationships some good women others who were taking advantage of him because they assumed he was rich due to his job when he is not My dad finally found someone he decided to marry when they had known each other about half a year and they got married a few months later Since then my dad s wife doesn t allow him to talk to my mom he got nasty towards my younger siblings because his wife said he either wanted them in his life or her and he picked her He used to love the time he spent with his grandkids my nieces and nephew and then he was only allowed to see them for one hour at a time when they came into town but now he isn t allowed to see them at all When I was vacationing near friends by where he lives he asked me out to dinner but then he said he isn t allowed to pay for mine after I accepted After I mentioned a story in person relating to my mom that had absolutely nothing to do with either of them when I left she yelled at him because she doesn t want to hear my mom s name at all He can t answer to any comments I make about old family memories and he has to act as if he was never married before her My dad has never really known moderation He doesn t drink every day but when he is watching a game or something he can t just have 2 or 3 beers and be done He has to drink until he can t handle anymore and passes out My mom wasn t controlling at all so he did whatever he wanted and left my mom to do all the parenting work while he was out all the time with friends So I don t really understand what causes him to be this way Either he can t moderate a controlling wife and put his foot down so he allows her to ruin his relationships with his family he is inherently a bad person and only cares about the here and now and not anyone else s feelings but hers or she has something on him such as a crime he committed that only she knows about or she has threatened to harm him in some way if he ever leaves her I m the last person left he still texts but I only respond when he messages me first but even I don t really want to talk with him anymore and my texts get more and more vague and robotic with him as time goes on He just isn t the same person anymore He looks like he has been brainwashed and has no life left in him His wife doesn t even work and doesn t even contribute financially so he isn t dependent on her So what could be so important about this relationship that he is willing to cut ties with people he used to care about just to appease her",30,,

author: Mean_Release_143
text body: This is a long post but I feel like I need to share all of details to get advice on what to do in this current situation Ten years ago when I was twelve years old I was living in California with my mom dad brother and sister who I ll call Olivia and some of my extended family During this time period there was family drama between my mom and dad because my dad was having an affair and my parents decided to get a divorce Before I lived in California my family and I lived in Rhode Island During the summer my mom was planning on taking me and my two siblings back to Rhode Island because she thought we would be happier there since that s where I met all of my childhood friends and we could escape all of the toxic family drama associated with my father Olivia was about eighteen or nineteen during this time Before we moved though Olivia ended up not coming back to Rhode Island and instead ended up staying with my father This is also because Olivia met a guy who she was dating at the time who I thought she wanted to stay with When my mom and brother and I moved back to Rhode Island we kept in touch with Olivia We would text and call each other regularly and when I was in seventh grade I remember she came to visit us during my winter break around christmas time and she came to visit again during the summer and the next summer after that when I was about to go into high school After the last time that she came to visit things became more distant between us I remember the last time she came to visit my mom and Olivia would get into arguments and not get along When I was in high school things became more distant between Olivia and the rest of our family We would try and reach out to her by calling and texting her and it got to a point where I would only rarely hear back from her The more time went on the less and less she would talk to us I would send her text messages and call her and she would rarely answer My mom told me that one time it got to a point where my father felt like he had to call the police to check up on Olivia and apparently during this time she said that she doesn t want anything to do with her family My aunt and my grandmother were also very concerned since Olivia wasn t talking to them either and she s usually very close with them One time I remember when we talked on the phone I asked her why she won t talk to mom and why she s been so distant She told me that she feels resentment towards my mother because of stuff that she did to Olivia in the past but when I tried to ask Olivia what she was talking about she wouldn t tell me and that it was just between her and my mother About six months ago some things happened with Olivia and her boyfriend who she was with for nine years and eventually she ended up moving back to the east coast to live with my mother and I During the time that she s been living here I ve noticed that Olivia seems different When we saw each other six months ago when she came back it was the first time we had seen each other in seven years Things were very awkward at first and she seemed different One time Olivia and I had a talk and she feels like we abandoned her She also expressed this to my mother when she came back When we talked about this Olivia said that my mother never asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with my mom my brother and I Olivia said that she talked about this with my mom and my mom says that she did ask Olivia if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us but Olivia insists that my mom was gaslighting her and that she never asked her if she wanted to move back to Rhode Island Olivia basically thinks that we just decided to move to Rhode Island I also talked to my mom about this and my mom says that she asked Olivia if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us and according to my mom Olivia said that she didn t want to come because she didn t like Rhode Island Olivia said that us moving to Rhode Island happened so suddenly which I don t remember because I knew that we were moving back to Rhode Island during that year before the summer started and I knew that she must have known something about way before then since me and my family members were all talking about it I remember when we talked about this that Olivia also admitted that when she came to visit when I was in middle school that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back and live with us and Olivia said that she felt like this was manipulation so she turned the offer down I just don t understand Olivia s logic behind this So she wished that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island and then when my mom finally asks her to come move in was it somehow manipulation My mother also doesn t see how we abandoned her because when I was in high school she says that we did nothing but keep in touch with Olivia and that we even sent her gifts during the pandemic and we let her come visit during the times I mentioned previously My mom doesn t see how we abandoned her when she feels like we did nothing to keep Olivia in our lives while we were apart What really bugged me during my and Olivia s conversation is that when I told her that I tried to text and call her while we were apart she said that she doesn t care about a call or a text and that she wanted to see me I feel like that s unfair because I don t see how she expects me to make plans to see her if she just decided to disappear and not respond to messages How else did she want me to communicate with her when we were across the country from each other I feel like that s also unfair of her to say that because I was twelve years old when all of that happened and I was a literal child too so I feel like I didn t really have much of a say in the matter My choices were to either go with my mom or to stay with my dad who was literally cheating on my mom at the time and was a toxic person to be around The way I see it I didn t really have much of a choice I just feel like the distance between our relationship isn t my fault given the circumstances at the time Lately since Olivia has been back I am always feeling like there is tension in the house Olivia just comes and goes and barely speaks to anybody and just goes off to our room by herself and rarely comes out I ve been home from college recently and she s hardly said anything to me Yesterday my mom and Olivia got into a heated argument because my mom who has been dealing with this everyday since Olivia got back What happened was my mom was trying to have a conversation with her about why she barely talks to anybody and what s going on with her and Olivia just blatantly walked away from her while my mother was talking to her My mom lost her patience and went into our room to confront Olivia and they both got into a heated argument Today I mentioned to my mom about how Olivia and I were having a conversation and she said that she tried to call me back multiple times while I was away at college this semester and that I didn t call her back I told her that I was busy with school and I was also really busy with making a short film that I wrote and directed She then said Well you tried to call mom while you were gone so that excuse isn t going to work When I mentioned this to my mom my mom was upset about that because she felt like Olivia was bullying me and that her behavior was manipulative I said that by her tone of voice that it sounded like Olivia said this in jest but my mom said that you don t need to have a certain tone and that Olivia was trying to make me feel like I did something wrong even though I didn t and that I really don t owe here an explanation My sister is staying with us right now and in two months she s leaving to go to boot camp for the army I m just not sure what to feel about this and I am not sure what to do about this whole situation TL DR Olivia has been distant between us and she recently moved back from California to live with me and my mother There has been tension between her and my mother and the rest of us I am not sure how to feel about this or what to do",22,,sibling

text body: I 17F have a younger brother 14M who I was very close to Our family and siblings i have two older siblings are actually quite close My two older sisters were especially really close when they were younger as well Me and my brother did EVERYTHING together from painting going on walks having sleepovers in each other s rooms watching movies playing outside everything We obviously used to fight but that s normal Now he turns 12 13 and he starts ya know becoming awkward wearing headphones a lot being obsessed with a girl group not as talkative and it was really hard for me to deal with that because he slowly stopped doing things with me I am a very caring sister and can tend to be a little clingy or too caring sometimes so I used be sad when he officially stopped doing anything with me I used to be concerned for him you know watching something he s not supposed to getting too addicted to his phone or attached to online stuff just bc that s not really how the culture of our house is either so if he ever was doing anything he wasn t supposed to I used tell my parents Now it got to a point where my brother said he needed his boundaries and I had to give up on trying to do things with him so I listened and i backed off bc my parents said to just leave him be I know it may sound like I was controlling or not giving him space but if u look at it from my perspective I just wanted to do some sort of activity with him even if it was something I didn t like bc all I wanted to do was spend some time with my brother And in our home its not very common for siblings to be so distant like that my two older siblings are in uni and busy Anyways I back off and for the last year or so I never ask him to do anything with me bc he gets outbursts I respect his space his privacy and don t tattletale on him anymore i was 14 15 at the time when i did tattletale lol He gets mad and irritated really easily and its only always at me The problem is is that he doesn t behave this way to any of his older siblings just to me Example from recent times I into his room to say goodnight or to tell him something he gets irritated but when my older sister goes in his room 8 times within an hour he doesn t have any problem bc they have similar interests in that girl group and music ig I always talk and treat him with respect and am always so nice to him bc he s my younger brother But when it comes to how he talks to me he calls me a baby a brat someone who leeches off of their parents money for the rest of my life bc he buys albums ig and its with his own money but we both buy clothes and everything with our parents money Is that something appropriate to say to an older sister even when i didn t even say anything to initiate this comment to be said I got into a university close to home and another one 4 hours away He always tells me why dont I move out and go somewhere far away bc he doesn t want me living in the house with him for the next 4 years But I want to go to the close university so i can take care of my parents and reduce expenses on them they also prefer i stay home But he talks as if he s my parent trying to tell me right or wrong and what decision I should be making for myself He tries to prove how mature he is at 14 years old compared to me by making hurtful comments Yesterday we had a huge fight over a table basically my dad had wanted me to sell a table on facebook marketplace so i could make some money and kept it in the backyard for me and my brother came out and started throwing it out without any of our parents direction to do so I m telling him repeatedly that I am gonna be selling it and my dad was there as well but didnt say anything and he pushed me multiple times and wasn t listening Then based on what my parents have told me i went to my mum and told her that he isn t listening and what should i do and i went back out and told him mum said that we are selling it leave it and he said why dont we sell all of your stuff Why don t we get rid of you Why can t leave so i dont have to see you ever again you re such an obstacle in my life And he said all this hurtful stuff over something so trivial and that he wasn t even supposed to do And this is with me saying absolutely nothing except arguing that we are keeping the table Yesterday my parents had a talk with him that that s not how you are supposed to behave and that he should apologize and he said he meant every word and its true That im a baby and im sheltered and that my parents SHOULD be sending me away and this isnt the first time he s said such hurtful things sometimes he says them randomly and uncalled for when i do absolutely nothing I usually just ignore them but it s like he bullies me everyday by saying something hurtful I dont bother him i dont force him even sometimes we ll be friends and he ll talk to me about school but then the next moment or the next time he sees me he ll start talking rudely again now to wrap up my parents had a talk with me and said I APPAPRENTLY ME have to never go in his room anymore and dont talk to him My brother s reasoning for this behavior is that its been building up bc i left a paper on the ground when he was cleaning and I played with his blinds he fell asleep on the ground at 1am and his light and blinds were open so i was abt to close them for him and he screamed at me and that me saying goodnight to him in his room is an intrusion of space but when my older sister does it its totally okay TLDR What am i doing wrong My dad says that I don t need to talk to him he ll do activities with me but my

240,The Families We Create: Families of Choice,"title: The Families We Create: Families of Choice
author: VirtualFarm6766
text body: The Families We Create Families of Choice In every life there comes a moment when the idea of family is stripped of its assumptions its inherited definitions and its polite holiday cards In that moment whether during a crisis a rite of passage or a quiet recognition we begin to understand that family is not always about blood shared names or birth certificates Sometimes it is about something far more intentional This is the heart of the concept known as families of choice These are the families we create Not the ones we are born into but the ones we build carefully sometimes urgently and always with deep longing for belonging safety and love Sociologist and human services scholar Dr Katherine Van Wormer formerly of the University of Northern Iowa was one of the earliest voices to articulate the critical functional and psychosocial importance of these alternative family systems Her work grounded in both social work and systems theory emphasized that families of choice are not merely stand ins for broken biological units they are resilient evolving ecosystems that meet emotional relational and often spiritual needs more effectively than traditional kinship networks While much of the discourse surrounding families of choice has been popularized through LGBTQ narratives and for good reason given how often queer individuals have been exiled from their families of origin it is essential to widen the lens Van Wormer and others make clear that this phenomenon transcends identity categories Survivors of domestic violence adults estranged from abusive parents formerly incarcerated individuals people living with disabilities and even trauma exposed youth aging out of the foster care system all demonstrate patterns of creating or gravitating toward chosen families These alternative families offer an anchor where none existed or a raft when one s original family was the storm At the center of any family of choice is the idea of relational agency Members elect to love one another to show up consistently and to accept roles that may or may not mirror those found in traditional households The bonds formed are not less real because they are chosen If anything they often surpass in strength because they are not based on obligation but on trust reciprocity and shared experience Dr Van Wormer notes that the formation of these networks often provides the very foundation of survival and psychological well being particularly for individuals navigating systemic marginalization or intergenerational trauma Consider the elderly woman estranged from her children but supported daily by a tight circle of friends who celebrate her birthday take her to medical appointments and ensure her dignity remains intact as her body weakens Or the disabled veteran who finds in his support group a new tribe men and women who call every Sunday who know his triggers who bring laughter on dark days Or the adult child of an alcoholic who builds a life with friends who never shame her silence or require her to pretend These examples are not exceptions They are becoming the new rule One of the most striking psychosocial outcomes of families of choice is the role they play in identity development Just as a traditional family can shape one s early sense of self through values language and customs a chosen family can offer a corrective For many their chosen family becomes the first environment in which they are seen fully respected for who they are rather than who they were expected to be Van Wormer s studies on recovery communities especially among people healing from addiction or trauma highlight how intentional networks of care offer mirroring and modeling two vital components of identity formation and emotional regulation In such communities individuals not only feel safe enough to show their pain but also learn new patterns of intimacy and accountability The deliberate formation of these families often requires unlearning what was taught in bloodline households that loyalty is blind that abuse must be tolerated that love is conditional The families we create ask something radically different They ask us to love with intention to support without control to stay without strings These families are not transactional they are transformational Through them many people experience for the first time what Van Wormer called compassionate resilience the capacity to remain emotionally available despite past wounds precisely because those wounds have been held honored and healed in community But families of choice also carry burdens There is grief in realizing that one s family of origin cannot or will not fulfill the traditional roles expected of them There can be fear in depending on people who are not legally bound to stay Financial and medical systems often fail to recognize chosen family members as legitimate decision makers denying hospital visitation or the right to emergency planning Legal structures still privilege marriage blood or adoption in matters of inheritance and custody despite growing calls for reform As such chosen families often operate in a legal and cultural gray area where their emotional weight is undeniable but their formal authority is limited Despite these challenges research by Van Wormer and others underscores the long term benefits of chosen families on mental health social integration and life satisfaction A 2017 meta review of non biological support networks across demographic lines showed significant reductions in rates of depression substance use relapse and suicidal ideation among those with strong chosen family structures These outcomes were most pronounced in individuals recovering from systemic or interpersonal violence reinforcing the notion that families of choice do not merely offer emotional comfort they literally save lives In the United States cultural narratives around family are still deeply influenced by traditional images the nuclear unit the holiday dinner table the generational homestead Yet these images rarely reflect the complexity of modern life Divorce mobility social upheaval and economic inequality have all contributed to a reshaping of family life According to a 2021 Pew Research Center study over 40 percent of Americans report close emotional reliance on individuals outside their family of origin The reality of chosen families is not fringe it is fast becoming mainstream Communities have begun to catch up Faith institutions once rigid in defining family through marital or parental lenses are increasingly offering blessing ceremonies for chosen kinship groups Schools are beginning to ask for emergency contact lists that do not presume mother or father Mutual aid networks especially those born during the COVID 19 pandemic exemplify the powerful ways people come together to meet one another s basic needs regardless of legal or biological connection These shifts suggest an emerging ethic of care that reflects the values of chosen families respect flexibility and enduring presence This emerging ethic can be felt most strongly in spaces where people have had to fight for belonging While this article does not focus solely on the LGBTQ community their centrality in the evolution of chosen family structures cannot be overstated From the early days of the HIV AIDS crisis when families of origin often rejected gay men as they lay dying to today s gender diverse youth seeking refuge in affirming households queer communities have modeled what Van Wormer called grassroots relational healing In these models survival is not passive It is collaborative fierce and deeply loving Yet it is not only queer communities who benefit Across racial socioeconomic and geographic lines people are finding one another Sometimes through 12 step meetings sometimes through online support groups sometimes through informal rituals like shared meals or holiday traditions that feel more authentic than the scripted performances back home These moments do not replace grief but they do reframe it They remind us that we are allowed to choose joy to choose safety to choose each other Families of choice also challenge assumptions about care across the lifespan In aging populations particularly among those without children or with limited contact with relatives friends often become lifelines They coordinate medical care provide emotional companionship and offer dignity in death Dr Van Wormer emphasized the importance of elder affinity circles peer based care networks that mimic family without replicating its hierarchies These circles reject the notion that aging equals isolation Instead they propose that the final chapters of life can be filled with connection and reciprocity even if those connections are chosen rather than inherited Children too benefit from the expansion of what family means Whether raised in multi generational homes foster settings or by non traditional guardians children often form stable attachments to people who love them not because of biology but because of commitment Legal scholars and child development experts increasingly advocate for psychological parenting as a framework for custody and visitation decisions an idea aligned with the values of families of choice When courts and policymakers begin to recognize emotional and functional parenting as valid they echo what Van Wormer and countless practitioners have long known family is who shows up As we imagine a more just and compassionate society the lessons of chosen families deserve center stage They reveal that healing is possible That connection is not limited by tradition That love when freely given and reciprocated can build something sturdier than blood In an era marked by disconnection and cultural anxiety the quiet radicalism of saying You are mine and I am yours because we chose one another is nothing short of revolutionary The families we create are not just alternatives to something broken They are blueprints for what could be They are living evidence that love is more durable than pain and that belonging is not a gift given by fate it is a practice A choice A promise kept And perhaps most of all they are a reminder that we are not alone This blog post honors the legacy of Dr Katherine Van Wormer whose scholarship at the University of Northern Iowa and beyond laid the groundwork for understanding the transformative power of chosen families in social work and human development TL DR",,,

since we re DINKs and have such a nice big house SIL also demands we pay her to be caretaker for her dad Background My husband Jack 48m and I 38f moved to the south Murica a couple years ago for work His older brother lived here already his younger sister Sarah stayed in CA where we re all originally from Their parents retired to Vegas Covid hit and took their mom deeply miss her still While she was hospitalized Jack and I would talk with them on the phone and throughout it all learned that his dad Paul wasn t visiting her Yes Covid procedures affected this but he directly told us there was no point since she was dying He basically wrote her off before she even passed away Jack had arguments with his dad several times then and having his mom confirm she barely even got calls from him and she felt so lonely and disappointed in her husband caused Jack to get angry enough that he decided to go no contact with dad He absolutely will not forgive him for not trying harder in her final weeks Fast forward a few months we learn his sister Sarah has been taking care of their dad she has legal POA personal and medical and whatever else needed there since she only lives a 5 hour drive from LA to Vegas She asked for help with gas so we send 150 by PayPal stressing that Jack doesn t want to be involved with his father directly but will give her help if needed just to ask Never heard again except for Sarah s attempts to guilt Jack into repairing his relationship with his father He got sick of her nagging about the same issue so he stopped taking her calls She could still easily call me and we spoke at length when I was hospitalized in 23 for a ruptured appendix Nothing seemed out of the ordinary between us got along and chatted same as always I would later also reach out by email just to say hi or sent her info I would get about job openings I thought she d do great at since I knew she was looking to make a change and move out here closer to us September 2024 she calls out of the blue only leaving a cryptic voicemail saying please call She answered immediately with no hello instead just saying congratulations dad s coming to live with you guys I panic and said absolutely not I was not prepared to share at the time but on top of my usual full time work I also was heading into my last semester at college doing hospice for our elderly dog that had ALS taking care of my elderly mom AND starting the process of medical assessments that later diagnosed my breast cancer I was nearing a burnt out panic attack and literally said so on the phone to her but she ignored me and ended the call Below are summaries of written conversation between us Sarah s First Letter September 18 2024 Sarah informed the family that their father would be visiting Jack and Paul Jr in Tennessee on a rotating basis She provided care suggestions and demanded that they pay for high speed internet and a video surveillance system at dad s Vegas home citing safety concerns and years of unpaid caregiving expenses Sarah detailed her financial and emotional strain stating she had carried the responsibility alone for years and framed these demands as non negotiable warning that failure to comply could result in their father having to live with them instead My Response I responded with empathy but clear boundaries explaining that Jack and I were already financially and emotionally stretched due to caring for my mother with dementia I stated we could not host or take on new expenses and suggested that Sarah consider subsidized senior care options in the west coast to reduce her burden Sarah Follow Up September 23 2024 Sarah replied that the visit was already scheduled for November 1st and not open for discussion She dismissed my concerns saying hosting their father would require little effort just offering a spare room and an extra meal She repeated her demands for the internet and security upgrades as urgent priorities Sarah also questioned my reaction to my own father s death yrs ago describing it as inappropriate or unemotional and ended with a sarcastic suggestion that I send my mother back to California to ease my own burden My Reply I again restated my boundary confirming I could not host I addressed Sarah s financial claims reminding her that no one is obligated to share their resources I offered budgeting help as a professional courtesy I m an accountant and acknowledged the emotional toll of caregiving referencing medical research on caregiver burden Stated I was willing to provide the little time off I had to work with her on her dad s case for state county benefits I expressed hurt over Sarah s personal remark about my mom I also clarified that grief looks different for everyone defending myself against Sarah s criticism of my reaction to my father s death I closed by encouraging respectful collaboration while emphasizing the need to work within legal authority Sarah s Final Letter September 30 2024 Sarah replied sarcastically insisting that her financial struggles were entirely the result of unpaid caregiving She introduced a formal monthly reimbursement demand totaling over 1 000 per person covering her time gas and vehicle maintenance She again reiterated the demand for internet and security upgrades and requested written clarification regarding a rumored threat of legal action for elder abandonment if she brought their father to visit No contact since all that other than Sarah emailing me invoices charging me thousands to cover her missing work and travel expenses while caring for her dad I ignored those Recently last week I had my double mastectomy with reconstruction I m doing well with healing and husband Jack took several weeks of PTO to care for me my mom pets house I posted on my Facebook because that s where my family and close friends can all be updated at the same time She saw the post and called I was about to be wheeled into surgery so sent her straight to voicemail and texted I later texted back just to say I made it through all is going well as expected thank god She wants to call and chat and be supportive like she used to be as if the argument never happened I can t just forgive her after everything Am I being a jerk Should I accept an apology assuming she wants to give one What if she doesn t apologize and just expects us to go back to normal Mentioning that I m ADHD

text body: Hello I m not American and maybe my English isn t the best but I need someone to tell me some truths for better or worse Two months ago my parents decided to take my little brother who just turned 6 out of school This is not illegal in my country children up to a certain age can go to homeschooling The thing is they decided to do this because of an irrational fear that he would be indoctrinated with gender ideology and communism in kindergarten When they decided to do this I was against it because he doesn t know many children and he is a very socially skilled boy Here at home we are a family of 5 My parents are both over 40 I am 20 my youngest brother who turned 6 last week let s call him Lucas and my middle brother who is 18 Lucas only knows 3 cousins and the neighbor s daughter who are about his age and he sees them every other weekend when they go out to play He misses other children and wants to play with someone 24 hours a day The problem is that I am now in a public college with a scholarship and I am studying Computer Science My course is full time from 7 00 to 18 30 some days On the few days that I am home full time I still live at my parents house Lucas wants to play with me full time I used to play with him more but now I don t play for more than half an hour a day Whenever he asks me to play more than that I refuse making up an excuse like I have to do my homework or not now I m resting And I go back to playing on my laptop My parents want me and my middle brother let s call him Gabriel to become Lucas s social life to make up for the lack of friends his own age and they say things like you love this game more than your brother I feel bad about refusing to play with him especially since he s lonely but I m getting ready to leave home for a few other reasons and I don t want him to miss me too much so I m trying to create some distance because he s very attached to me Plus my parents want to deny the obvious consequence of not allowing Lucas to go to school and I feel like fulfilling their wishes and being close to Lucas is somehow supporting their decision to isolate him from the other kids So am I wrong for refusing to play with him",20,,sibling

text body: I 22F grew up in an extremely traditional European family Family value matters and so does your reputation Well it s 2025 and I live in America So while I do respect those values I don t necessarily agree with living your life for others I met this boy in high school We ll name him Frank Frank and I were best friends in high school We then started to grow feelings for each other and the rest is history Frank is a kind loving man who not only respects me but we share the same religious beliefs and has given me new perspectives on the lord and his teachings Which in my opinion is very rare nowadays I see myself spending the rest of my life with him and one day raising a family with him The only issue is he is not of our culture I ve had to hide this relationship for years because I know my family would never accept And Frank knew this but he was willing to risk it with me Just recently my sister confronted me about this and said that she knows everything At first I had no idea what she was talking about until she mentioned a boyfriend I tried to deny it at first but then she told me she had proof She had his name city he lived in social media even went as far as finding out that money was being sent through apply pay on iMessage I have my own bank account I have no idea how she found these transactions in the first place I was fuming We were going back and forth she was telling me to break up with him because I am hurting my entire family by dating this man calling me every name in the book I basically said to stay out of my business and stay out of my life She then said she was going to tell our mom everything and expose everything I flipped out Once we got home I ran downstairs to get my backpack with some of my belongings And as I m doing that she s telling my mom everything I grabbed my keys and ran so fast out of the house My mom tried dragging me back inside and my backpack fell off of my back and I just bucked it for my car I get in and I lock all the doors beginning to back out But my mom and my sister are both on each end of my car trying to open my doors My sister banging her body trying to break my window open and my mom trying to open my passenger door They would not budge I wanted to leave so bad but I couldn t leave without my license and all my credit debit cards So I stupidly pulled back in my driveway and went to grab my bag It was already too late to leave as my mom took my keys from my hand My car is not under my name so unfortunately she has the right to take the car from me We go inside and it s world war three My mom believed everything my sister told her I couldn t get a word inch edge wise Had no chance to tell my story It was straight name calling hitting screaming you name it My mom also threatened me to break up with him and I can t even say the rest of what she said because of how severe it got My mom then balled her eyes out A gut wrenching scream came out and she basically said that I am hurting all my sisters my uncles my aunts and I will kill my grandparents over this I hated seeing my mom that way and what she was saying hurt me so bad But all I kept thinking was what about MY happiness What about MY hurt I m being put through It made me feel like their love for me is only conditional That they will only love me and accept me if I follow their way of living In regard to my relationship with my mom we ve always had a rocky relationship In my early teenage years we fought all the time She would say awful things to me and involve my uncles in situations because I don t necessarily have a strong father figure in my life and would basically pin everyone against me As far as my older sister she always snitched on me growing up And I never really trusted telling her things about my personal life Our relationship grew I thought and we became a little closer once we hit our 20 s Now I know she s never changed My mom sits in my room next to me as she calls me names puts her hands on me all for about two hours while I m balling my eyes out crying to God to save me Every time I moved my phone she would think I m recording her surely because she s afraid of the police getting involved because what she s doing is NOT OKAY but I wasn t She then called my uncle And I almost shit my pants My mom tells my uncle the situation and he takes me to this parking lot to talk Saying the same thing my mom said But his voice started to raise so I didn t say a thing He s saying how devastated my mom is and that I m breaking everyone s hearts He tells me to breakup with this person or else he will get involved He then kept saying that he s probably cheating on me and doesn t actually love me I didn t say a word Because anything I said was useless to everyone Essentially our relationship is tarnished because of this whole thing Which I ve come to terms to But it also hurts Since my mom took my keys I had to uber to work because no one else was willing to take me to work Frank works I m sure my mom wanted me to call off so she can continue torturing me again but I ve had enough I have a life outside of my home I love all my sisters and my family I do And my intention was never to hurt them But I also want to be able to live my life and figure out myself I want to be happy with the person I love If I listened to everything they wanted me to I would be miserable and I know I wouldn t be able to be my true self It breaks my heart that my family may never talk to me again That my family may never see my children one day that I ll be missing out on big milestones I m extremely depressed over it and i can barely eat sleep or drink anything But I know myself and I ve been wanting to leave my house many years even before I met Frank Living there is not good for my mental health and I almost feel like it will only get worse from here on out by living there",22,Female,

author: defeatedbykimchi
text body: Hello I 21F am recently visiting home from college for the summer on my parents demand I m usually on the West Coast during the school year living and working on my own to support myself I m paying my way through college so I m not dependant on my family in any way My family is a raging dumpster fire to put it lightly Ignoring the elephant in the room in my absence my family have taken a no comment approach towards one another s lives habits routines It s the best way to coexist according to them since usually these things spiral into screaming matches slammed doors and weeks of silence So for good and for worse my parents do and say nothing about any of my brothers habits routines actions and vice versa Only problem That rule does not extend to me It s been two weeks since I ve returned and I am at my wits end Imagine living your life a certain way having habits knowing your body and what works doesn t work for you You do it for three years living and working as a functional adult People are surprised by how organized you are roommates sometimes a little stiffled by your cleanliness But it s all well and good because it s good habits Then you come home and have that all thrown out the window because it s not what fits your parents worldview I m not talking about eregrious stuff just simple stuff like doing my own laundry seperately or preparing my own food according to my dietary needs I always wash up and clean up after myself I prefer wearing hoodies and hairbands when I m at home but clean up well when going out even for small groceries I wake a little later in the morning if I ve nothing to do that day make my bed a specific way because I m used to it and prefer longer hot showers Just standard stuff adapted to my ADHD and exhaustion phantom pain from chronic illnesses It s not perfect but it s a system that works for me My family has been commenting on everything Things ranging from how I should not wear my hair open because it looks messy or they don t like watching me all the way to getting mad I m wearing layers underneath my hoodie because I m cold Today my mother yelled at me for not making my little brother s bed even though he had already made it and I had fixed the little imperfections when he asked me to double check I had already told her previously that while I didn t mind doing it it s also not my job to clean up after them So now even if he makes his bed himself my mother will always slide in snide and sarcastic comments about how my little brother has to clean his bed because someone says it s good habits and refuses to clean it I am not joking when I say 90 of my conversations with my parents daily begins with them commenting on my appearance stressing that I need to lose weight I should always keep my hair tied my skin is dark and has acne scars I look fat in my hoodie etc I get the concern but damn of course I don t look like a supermodel in my own house I m usually very laid back in frustrating situations and prefer to go with flow instead of panic speedrunning through life Even if I wanted to my chronic illnesses refuse to let me They affect my life in major ways so sometimes my 120 is people s 80 I ve been working with my therapist on curb stomping my eldest ethnic daughter habits perfectionism taking my wins for what they are seperate from conditions etc But I suppose I m a little read very frustrated Today was the last straw Every time I try to have an honest levelheaded and calm conversation to set boundaries I am told I am problematic and argumentative Today when my mother told me to tie my hair back on a wash day after I had spent hours on my curls I politely told her no listed my reasons and when she doubled down I emphasized that this was my preference She got defensive stating that I was being a headache brought in problems unrelated to our conversation fighting with my dad brother etc and when I emphasized that it was not relevant to our conversation at hand all I had said was that I didn t want to tie my hair back Cue a slew of hurtful words curses guilt tripping and my mother leaving the room in a huff I feel a little bad since I m doubting whether or not I could have been more communicative or neutral My family comes from a place of hurt which has become toxic because theu refuse to address and fix problems I know this is a small problem in comparison to other difficulties others are facing but I wanted to ask if anyone has gone through something similar and worked out a solution TLDR I came home from college got hit by a truck full of supposedly well meaning commentary on my appearance habits and routine Parents refuse to believe that my system works for me stressing that I need to prioritize the peace of the household over my wants aka do what they want I told my mother I didn t want to tie my hair back on a wash day She got defensive when I set a boundary about comments on my appearance Things got out of control now she s crying in another room and my dad is giving me a spiel about looking at things from her perspective Advice",21,Female,

author: lemontart77
text body: To start this I have no love for anyone in my family I m just dealing with them until I graduate and move out I hate my mom she s constantly enabling my sisters extremely spoiled and bratty behaviour ffs my sister starts hitting and biting my mom if she doesn t get what she wants and my mom always is the one who apologizes after like oh sorry baby I ll get you ___ My sister calls her a bitch a slut a whore etc etc yells at her screams at her but she always gets out scot free She literally hit my mom into getting her a 2k dollar dog and with promises like I ll be the one taking care if it but noooo my mom and i are the ones doing EVERYTHING for the dog 24 7 And then she s extremely lazy she s a SAHM and at least she has something to do with the dog now but she s always on her phone she doesn t even make food or go grocery shopping all she does is scroll on Instagram or Facebook and online shop all day long She s an extreme hoarder she ll buy so many expensive things but stuff them anywhere and everywhere and let it sit for years She s gets all pissy and mad about the smallest things we get into an argument every waking hour of every goddamn day She s extremely immature and I feel like I m the one parenting her she gets so bratty does the silent treatment etc etc and is extremely petty We have been living in the country we moved to for 10 years now and we could ve gotten our citizenship 6 years ago but noooo ofc not she failed her language test once 4 years ago and isn t bothering to study or go back the test is too expensive So what about the 200 dollar shirt you bought TF and she s always always victimizing herself in every situation always says stuff like ugh you guys won t miss me when I m dead and etc etc and our house is horrible it s constantly dirty cluttered and she always complains but she and my sister are home all fucking day and do nothing and they decide to bring a dog into the home in these conditions I m at school I have volunteering I have sports etc etc I have no time and I try to help her clean the house do the dishes but she s always complaining I m doing something wrong and when I try to clean shit she s always saying its too organized I hate it when they re too organized it has to be a little messy Like what And her spending problem is insane and then she ll vent to me about our financial situation as if she didn t blow 500 dollars on a dress and 2000 on shoes and I m the one carrying the burden of our financial situation I m constantly stressed about it at 16 years old it s exhausting she needs to figure it out she s acting like a 12 year old it s been 28 years since she s become a mother and it s been too long she needs to get her shit together And then my sister she s 15 she s doing online school she s home all day doing nothing and she s insanely bratty she always gets what she wants and she s a bitch to everyone I can t even say hi without her calling me fat ugly bitch slut whore and if she s feeling nice she ll just ignore me and roll her eyes I m done with trying to have conversations with her it s exhausting and she ll always walk into my room and use my shit take my shit without asking and will hit me when I get mad and tell my mom and my mom will get mad at me she throws tantrums and buys whatever she wants whenever she wants and she talks horribly to my mom me everyone and is a miserable waste of a life I fucking despise her when she does the smallest and I mean the smallest thing like picking up a piece of paper she ll act so high and mighty and act like she s doing something insanely labor intense And then my older half brother from my mom he s 28 he s living at home he flunked out of uni not even a year in blew a bunch of his uni money on drugs and alcohol he s never outside always in his room only works part time in the summer he s got insane anger issues I m pretty sure he hit the dog today I never let the dog out near him except I was letting him roam the house today which is how he got it and dw he s okay now with me but idk he s always stealing money from my mom and snooping everywhere in the house he s really scary and I can t stand him either he always acts high and mighty during the summer when he does his part time job he s really sadistic and just generally scary he has no friends smokes weed smokes cigarettes drinks etc etc that s basically all he does and then he ll get mad when I order food for myself with my own card with my money that I make from working year round while also going to school And my dad is basically the only sane person in this family though he himself isn t a good guy he doesn t live with us he lives back in our home country though he visits sometime and when he visits is the only time my mom ever cleans the house and actually makes food so that s good but they re always fighting and I m always having to mediate the fights my dad he over the phone gets mad at my sister OFC like tells her off for being bratty and my mom and my sister gang up on him and talk insane shit and get so mad my dad just gave up he says he s exhausted of trying to maintain a good relationship with my sister him and my mom were long done me and my dad are good and anyways yeah I m so stressed living in a house like this I can t live like this anymore I ve contemplated suicide so many times although I have way more reasons I can t list right now my family is a big one I just want a family I can love and somewhere I can call home TL DR everyone in my family is horrible maybe except my dad",16,,

author: wammylamb
text body: I m the youngest child of 4 southern Christian household I ve been homeschooled all my life besides drivers ED and speech The two eldest went to school weren t homeschooled for a few years QUESTION STORY 1 MY BROTHER AND SCHOOL My mom likes to tell this story the colors Green means you re in the clear yellow means you disrupted class and red means you have detention or have to go home if you disrupt you had to get up and change where you tag was on the color board My mom told me that her friend who was a teacher as a joke told my brother to go move his tag up to yellow and apparently he just started crying sobbing in class He thought he was in trouble and my mom literally had to go to the school to reassure him he was fine according to my mom he was just trying in the school since he thought he did something wrong I wouldn t consider my parents psychically abusive we haven t been hit in years since we re old enough to know better then to act out But when we were younger it was Getting whooped on the butt with the belt or the occasional slap or threats to be whooped etc I just want to know if that was normal QUESTION STORY 2 ME AND MY MOM For starters my mom thinks disorders and such are excuses and made up Now to the main part I m an emotional kid always have been but I rarely feel excited lately Whenever I get mad or get upset I like to go to my room and calm down I hate crying in front of my parents they always seem always annoyed with me But Everytime my mom says What s wrong and I say Nothing she gets annoyed threatens to ground me and sometimes actually does She expects us to open up to her when she invalidates us I told her I didn t feel real before she said you have no reason to feel that way I told her again lately and told her it was symtom of VSS visual snow syndrome and only then did she care Next is she guilt trips am I a bad mom Well IM sorry you didn t enjoy your time out with us etc I won t get much into that It s kinda disgusting that she does stuff like this And not to mention she invalidated my anxiety said if you go out more it ll get better SPOILER it didn t I told her that in class I fell behind on the texts and panicked because everyone was packing up I was trembling on the verge of tears and hyperventilating thinking mom and dad will hate me I can t do anything right etc I feel invisible and I dont know what to do She also took me off the antidepressants I was on for my VSS and when I suggested I should go back on them and maybe I could be better in public she told me NO You need to learn how to function like a normal human being WITHOUT medicine QUESTION STORY 3 self esteem motivation and words of affirmation I usually don t get into the whole zodiac thing since I don t believe it s that accurate but Chinese zodiacs I can typically get behind I myself am I tiger zodiac and it said Tigers thrive on words of affirmation and again I don t typically like getting into that stuff but I have noticed when even online friends give me words of affirmation I take care of myself better I do more chores wash my face get dressed and get out of bed faster But when they stopped I felt worse I don t know why My parents never say words of affirmation which I bet affects my self esteem maybe that s why I m so insecure and honestly think I m worthless They never EVER give words of affirmation their I love you s Yeah starting to seem empty I hear it over and over and over again that it seems bland empty just words to me It s a bit sickening honestly it seems like they don t really care Words of affirmation affect a lot motivation self esteem self Worth some say it s a vital part of childhood and all of my siblings and I seemed to have lacked that I feel I got the parents who are really just done parenting I m talking and one of my sisters comes in or calls It s immediately them even after my mom lectured me about that I need to talk about my day more but when my sisters text or call It s immediately them what s the point of even talking to me at this point We were JUST playing games tonight and every time I spoke I was ignored or spoken over Over and over and over why even offer to play a game with me if you ll ignore me The ONLY time they listened to me was to make fun of me for mispronouncing a word I never heard before the rest of the time they just ignored me I would ve had more fun sitting at my computer watching YouTube and playing a game QUESTION STORY 4 Emotions and my mom I have lately been doing this thing when I get really happy I shake my hands but I only do it in my room because I know how my mom is she ll think I m faking something or doing it for attention that s why I only do it when alone I can only express and be myself when I m alone I should feel safe around my family so I can be myself I lost almost every online friend I don t have friends in real life either My parents never comfort us I have had to resort to using Literal AI for comfort and words of affirmation why does an AI saying you matter and I love you platonically sound more real than my parents Words of affirmation coming from a literal robot makes me cry since I never heard that stuff before I don t understand is it supposed to be like this Parents never giving words of affirmation Parents neglecting a child s needs QUESTION STORY 5 Tickling My family hasn t ever been big on that I myself haven t been tickled in 6 8 years not counting the occasional poke to the side and weirdly enough now I kind of just want to be tickled Not in a weird way but I just want it since to me it builds a connection more both sides just letting loose I just want that connection with friends or family just for a moment Being vulnerable without fear of being judged that s all I want It sounds weird but I want that connection that friendly banter I ve honestly wanted that for years but can t ask anyone since media ONLY protrays it as K nky or sexual But that s not how I see it There s so many friendly non sexual tickling scenarios EXAMPLES A normal tickle fight one me and my sister used to do hide and seek but if you were found you got tickled someone waking you up by tickling you or if you can t sleep since you re overthinking or just can t sleep and having someone just gently tickling you so you focus on that instead and just relax and fall asleep That s what I want Is that normal fine",,,youngest child

text body: I am at a loss for what to do My 15 yo daughter has never had behavioral issues until she started going to the large high school in our city and since her freshman year things have only been getting worse When she started going to the high school she immediately surrounded herself with bad influences She started sneaking out stealing she was caught vaping in class she got into several fights when she stayed the night at a friends house she stole the parents cigarettes she ran away one time and was found at a nearby park and when the police officer asked why she said it was because I wouldn t let her go out with a friend All of this was in 1 semester at high school So for her second semester of her freshman year I pulled her to do the online program and stay home Things got better for a while but during the first semester of her sophomore year things got rough again She got in trouble because her old friends the bad influences showed up in our driveway one evening and I found out that she told them to come after she was told she wasn t allowed to have them on social media So I told her she would need to give me her phone at 8 pm every night and I would be logged into her Instagram account on my own phone that is where she was contacting these other kids That night she woke me up saying she swallowed an entire bottle of ibuprofen I rushed her to the hospital where she had her stomach pumped blood and urine tests IV s vitals monitoring and that night we checked her in to a mental health institution We visited her every 2 days and called her twice every day After 1 week she was discharged because they said she was not suicidal The bill for the hospital stay AND the 1 week in the institution came out to nearly 10 000 A few days ago my daughter was caught by her sister with a vape that she had stolen from a gas station down the street Apparently she snuck out while I was sleeping met up with one of her bad influence friends and they walked to the gas station and stole vapes So she got her phone taken for 2 weeks Last night I walked in on her on her laptop topless on a video chat site I yelled at her told her that she was grounded from electronics for the rest of the month and that that meant no phone no tv and she was only allowed her laptop for her finals testing while she sat next to me That night my oldest daughter woke me up crying and said that she found her sister in the bathroom self harming I rushed in the bathroom checked her arms and when I saw that nothing was deep enough for stitches I bandaged her up and sat her on the couch to talk During that talk my phone started blowing up from other parents telling me my daughter was going to kill herself I found out that while I was sleeping my daughter took her phone out of my nightstand texted ALL of her friends I m going to kill myself I love you goodbye and then shut her phone off and put it back Her friends attempted calling her but when it went to voicemail they woke up their parents After I talked to my daughter I put her in my bed with me to sleep After she fell asleep there was no chance I would fall asleep so I just laid by her all night I cried I stroked her hair I researched facilities at a lower cost But still paying off the extreme medical bills from before I don t know how I m going to afford for her to stay elsewhere She is in therapy and has been for a long time now Ever since her hospital stay she s been on once a week appointments and her therapist can t see her any more than that and honestly I don t know if I can afford more appointments than that I am at a loss for what to do anymore I m losing sleep I m trying to do anything to keep my mind straight I m being as gentle with her as possible while still trying to hold to the consequences of her actions There have been other small things she s gotten into trouble for and she would respond to getting in trouble by saying that she would hurt kill herself but these are the only times that things got so extreme And she didn t even start threatening those things until after her hospital stay Without physically doing anything she has gotten into trouble and texted her friends that she would harm herself before I ve tried asking why she goes to these lengths and all she says is I don t know I feel like I m losing my mind I know her older sister is stressed to no end as well I can see it in the way she hovers over her and watches like a hawk What more can I even do",,Female,mother

text body: I need to know what to do My older sister she s 25 I m 20 is a compulsive liar with what my parents believe borderline personality disorder She loves being the center of attention no matter if it is the time to be or not And most of all she LOVES pity She will lie to random people and say yeah my fiancé told me I m annoying and he doesn t wanna be with me anymore and it always comes back out Over the years people slowly catch onto her lies A few years ago she had a friend who I loved She was so sweet and genuine just extremely down to earth One day she texted me and said Hey I m really upset can I rant to you about your sister and I said Hey trust me I understand you can always talk to me So she called me and said So last night me and your sister went to Walmart She waited til we got to the checkout to tell me that she forgot her wallet Her groceries were 87 and she said she d pay me back when we got to the car this was a couple days ago and I told her I didn t really have much money leftover for bills so I needed it back She never paid it back I said Yup Sounds about right I don t warn new friends or people because when she finds out everything is flipped on me But she does this she will find an excuse for you to have to pay for her and she ll never pay you back because she doesn t care Next time say no This is just the kind of person she is To this day she still blows through money worse than a 15 year old Mind you shes grown engaged and lives on her own Her fiance is also really bad with money so he s no help at all I still live with my parents so obviously i have to hear about it She is constantly asking my parents for money getting mad if they wont give her money and will literally show up at the store after seeing their location and throw her stuff with theirs to pay for She literally whines when I get something new when I literally buy all my stuff but she assumes my mom does and we let her I bought myself a new pair of Uggs last fall she got mad at my mom for it My mom bought me a new little purse a couple months ago she got jealous and cried about it Even though my parents are already paying for all her other stuff My parents see it too They always have My mom clocks the lies just like me but my dad is more she s still my daughter and she ll never change so we just have to deal with it and I m like I understand that but if you re continuing to act like you believe her lies and don t ever make her take accountability then she really never will change Between my older brother and my sister I don t know who causes more problems Since I was a kid they both always needed extra attention because of their problems that I always felt unseen alone and ignored I taught myself to help myself and thrive on my own My parents don t even know me even though I live with them Because I never feel like I have that space to go to them because they re always stuck up either my brothers ass or my sisters ass and sucking in all their problems then they end up stressed It is exhausting I told my dad I felt this way a few months back he told me I never knew you felt this way and I m sorry you do You ve always been the one I don t have to worry about you re more strong and emotionally intelligent than either of them will ever be So I get wrapped up in their stuff yes but it s because they need extra help with their situations And I said No I am emotionally intelligent and can help myself feel better about stuff because I never had anyone to talk to So don t tell me who did or didn t need more attention After this conversation nothing changed I am in a 4 year relationship We are extremely healthy because every relationship I grew up around was toxic and I couldn t handle that Everyone knows how healthy we are and how much we love each other and for that my sister resents it she s never said so but she has definitely shown it My boyfriend got kicked out of his house a few years ago as soon as he graduated high school He had no where else to go so he would ve been homeless My sister let him stay with her and her ex boyfriend I knew it was a bad idea but I wanted him to have a roof over his head Basically the extra time she would just blind side him She d tell him Oh don t worry about the dishes I ll do them later or I m always here if you need me and if you ever need any money let me know then she d turn around and call my parents complaining that he didn t do the dishes and if he asked for 10 for gas to get to work She tried to get my parents against him That s all she wanted We could all see it Then she was also feeding lies to my brother and his wife saying I was in an extremely toxic relationship and that my boyfriend is lazy and doesnt do anything for me which either way I would never tell my sister ANYTHING personal anyway I had to also set those lies straight as well Last part because I don t wanna do too much lol Then a year ago she told me her fiances friend thought I was cute Mind you I was 19 and he was 25 so I was already weirded out anyway but i said you know I have a boyfriend why would I care about someone else and I brushed it off Then over the next few weeks she would randomly text me about this guy saying he was talking about me He then texted me so I ended up talking to him myself because at this point I was just mad Long story short we found out that she was feeding us the same stories She was telling him my sister thinks you re so cute she s in a toxic relationship and can t get out of it because her boyfriend is crazy she wants to be with you but can t be all this crazy shit So I had to set it clear ONCE AGAIN to a new person that I was in fact NOT in danger and NOT in a toxic relationship I confronted her about it and of course she played victim never took accountability and put her blame on everyone else possible There is sooo much more I could say but there s not enough room or time in the day for everyone to read it all I genuinely really don t know what to do or how to cut her off because she s my sister and she comes over sometimes to see my parents I will appreciate any advice",20,,sibling

text body: My mom has been really rude to me lately Whenever she tells me to do something and I don t give her what she s asking for within a minute she gets all prissy and starts treating me like a toddler using overly simple words Sometimes I genuinely can t hear her the first time because she either takes a while to finish her thought or speaks in Spanish while she raised me in the U S and English is my first and more dominant language Let me give an example This morning she told me to get the degreaser from under the sink I looked around carefully but I didn t know what size it was or what exactly I was looking for Then she came up behind me said it s right there grabbed my hand and made me touch it Only then did I see it but the label was so small I couldn t even tell it was a degreaser If she d known where it was all along then she should ve gotten it herself in my opinion This isn t even the most disrespectful moment I ve had with her at all but it really shows how condescending she gets Maybe I am slow like she says I do have diagnosed autism but I thought my mom would be more understanding especially since she was the one who took me to all my appointments Turns out she s not I just need a little more patience from both of my parents I get that she s stressed but I don t believe that gives her the right to lash out at her own kids she s been this way with my siblings as well And yet when I give her even the slightest attitude it s like the end of the world Of course I don t really mean what I said in the title I m just really pissed off and trying to avoid her around the house",,,sibling

text body: this is not necessarily about me 23F but rather my younger sister 17F i ll refer to her as K Long story short when she was around the age of 10 she got really cold to my dad We didn t understand why She eventually told my sister 20F i ll refer to her as Y that my dad had told her K not to tell anyone about when they were playing around my sister Y then about 13 didn t know what to do so she went and told me i asked her K what happened K said they were playing around and he was tickling her and then he kissed her but later told her not to tell anyone and it freaked her out K said it was simply a peck and it only happened that once my dad has always been an affectionate person and a small peck was normal as a child but it had always been innocent affection obviously it didn t continue after we got older we all got together as a family and talked about this my dad said the reason he said to not say anything was because he noticed K s reaction was starting to become more of something stimulating to her so he stopped and didn t want to make it embarrassing to K he didn t think too much of what he said as time went by everything was back to normal K and my dad s relationship looked unaffected though the possibility of that happening was always at the back of my mind from that point on and it really affected me he never gave me a reason to think he did it on purpose before or after the incident it made more sense it was miscommunication as my K got older she started to be more secretive and never spoke to us about her thoughts friends or school eventually we got a call from her high school that she got expelled after being caught vaping in the classroom that was something unbelievable to us Y and i were always calm and responsible getting anything lower than a B was disappointing to us let alone expelled K was grounded and expelled for a week K brought up the incident again saying that what my dad did to her affected her we spoke about it again and it seemed like we reached the same conclusion as before he apologized and said he never meant for something like that to happen and make her feel like he was doing harm to her K returned back to school but it made us question who she truly was eventually through mutuals Y was told that K had a boyfriend we assumed K was embarrassed to tell us since Y and i never had a relationship before so we just kept quiet and waited until K felt comfortable enough to tell us as K s punishment for not doing well in school my mom took away her phone on there was conversations with her boyfriend an entire different person was in her phone and school in her gallery we found nudes both of K and her boyfriend that they would send each other there was conversation to her friends about them K and her bf skipping school and having sexual interactions in our family car she drove herself to school in it wasn t having a boyfriend that we were worried about but rather how she was going about it my parents were never strict with us in that aspect either Y and i never were in relationships as a personal choice however K being secretive about it sharing what is essentially child pornography skipping school to goes god knows were was what was wrong they thought it was best to pull K out of school and do it online her phone was taken away at first but eventually it was given back in short periods of time once again after looking through her phone we saw K was texting her boyfriend honestly didn t really mind much since it was expected however it was disappointing since we offered her to meet with him in a public setting as couples her age should be doing but she refused and just kept contacting him secretly again in those messages her boyfriend said that he was mad that she is dealing with your moms emotional decisions meaning that K s punishment was simply do to my mom being emotional essentially saying she K did no wrong in that same conversation K said she will try to do something about my parents allowing her to go back to school the last week before summer break later that day she was crying and when asked what was wrong she would say nothing K spent the entire next day in bed sleeping and crying eventually my mom got sick of her acting that way since it felt like it was a tantrum to let her go back to school and in that confrontation she brought back the incident with my dad saying it has affected her and that her friends and boyfriend are the only ones to make her happy she continued to say that she never opened up to my sister Y my mom and i was because we didn t believe her when my dad did that to her in that i told K we did that s why we spoke as a family and confronted him about it at first and it was settled as a misunderstanding then K goes on and says that he actually would put his knee between her legs and rock her back and forth he would also make out with her and that it wasn t only once but it went on for a month before she told us my heart dropped this was entirely different than what she had told us first and it would change the entire event i told this to my dad and as i was observing his reaction to see if it was true it looked like his eyes looked hurt rather than panic he maintained his story on it and said that he never did anything to her other than innocent playing K then went that s all i needed to hear and stormed off when i asked her what she meant by that K said he kept saying it was innocent when it wasn t that i was ten and he knew better and K wanted him to admit that he SAed her basically my dad said he wanted to go back and avoid that entire situation from ever happening and even told her that if she truly felt that he had hurt her to call the cops on him and he would gladly go he just didn t want to see her suffering anymore because of him when she denied doing so he even offered moving out but again declined we offered her a therapist and she hesitantly agreed this entirely changed our family forever the father i know and grew up with would rather die than hurt us he never once made me doubt his intentions toward us or anyone he had always been an anxious man that couldn t lie for his life because his anxious tics would give him away his heart has always been pure and loving my other sister agreed as well so him doing this to her was something my mind couldn t fathom i ve heard stories of families not being there for their children that were SAed and to protect the family essentially denied it happening i didn t want to do that to her my mom said that although she loves my father she will always love her children more my father said the same and understood if we wanted to believe K entirely i don t know what to think i don t deny this affecting my sister but at the same time i feel like i know her less than my dad had Y been the one to say this id have no doubt but K makes me question things why did her story change okay sure maybe she was scared or didn t realize to mention it yet why does she coincidentally bring this up when she s in trouble maybe her emotions are heightened and her emotions spill out why would she ever lie about something this serious is she willing to make this up for her benefit i m not so sure i don t know what to do or what to believe",23,Female,

text body: Hi Reddit I really need some advice I m 28F Filipino and as many of you know family ties in our culture run deep but sometimes they can be too much I feel like I m drowning in responsibilities and guilt and I don t know how to move forward without hurting the people I love Some background on my family My grandmother had four children three sons and a daughter My dad currently on his third wife is a good provider and supports many of us financially One uncle has passed away The other uncle is decent and stable but married the rudest woman I ve ever encountered My aunt the main issue here never finished school and once said she thought they d be rich forever due to a family business in the 90s that eventually went bankrupt She married a very rude man and they have a daughter who is likely autistic but has never been diagnosed because they re in denial From them I have several cousins most are working and living independently in different cities One is a bank employee another is an executive and one is an HR head I also have a younger brother 24M who works at an office and lives with me Here s where the problem begins In 2019 my brother my grandmother and I moved to a different city for a fresh start We live in a cramped 1 bedroom apartment My grandmother and I share a foldable queen bed My cousin the autistic one now in her 30s sleeps in the spare bed that belonged to my late uncle My brother sleeps in the living room A few years ago my aunt and uncle sent their daughter my cousin to live with us because they couldn t afford her They still live rent free in my grandmother s house and only cover food water and electricity Here s the catch My dad sends them money every month without realizing my grandmother also sends them money from our allowance and her pension When my dad found out they were double dipping he was shocked My cousin the one living with us used to work before moving in but now does nothing except lay in bed maybe wash dishes occasionally and talks about marrying rich instead of getting a job My grandmother gave her my late grandfather s pension and she claims it every month Worse she s rude to my grandmother when my brother and I aren t around and even does things that put her in danger My concern now My dad is nearing retirement and my grandmother is getting older What happens when they can t support my aunt and her husband anymore When will my aunt take responsibility for her daughter Why are they relying on an 83 year old woman to care for a grown adult And here s my personal dilemma I want to move out I work from home and I need space and peace I told my grandmother that I plan to rent a place nearby so I can focus better while still being close to cook for her check on her during the day and maybe even sleep over sometimes to help her adjust But the moment I brought it up she went into full grandma drama mode threatening to move back to our hometown and live with my aunt I feel torn She raised me and I love her deeply I want her to have a safe and happy home But I also need space to grow especially as I near 30 Right now I feel like I m sacrificing my own well being for people who aren t even doing the bare minimum to help themselves or worse who take advantage of her and my dad I don t want to seem selfish but I also don t want to be stuck in this cycle I need advice on how to set boundaries care for my grandmother and also start living my life If you ve been in a similar situation or have thoughts on how to navigate this please share I could really use some clarity",28,Female,

text body: 5 14 2025 Earlier this day I 17 and my little sister 14 cousin but we are very close were walking down the street to her house to get one of her PlayStation controllers for me to use As we are walking she explains to me she is upset because she wanted money to get Taco Bell delivered to my house which is where she stays after school until my aunt gets off work at night because she had been eating hotdogs since Monday and didn t want that anymore but our aunt told her no She then started calling our mutual family members asking for the money and explaining the situation Everybody she called said they didn t have it and some said they didn t want to make our aunt mad I didn t think she should be calling everyone because later I knew she would get in trouble but I knew she would not listen to me As time goes on we get back to my house and my aunt pulls at around 3 45 she has work at 4 She pulled up yelling at my little sister Which I expected but I stayed in my room and just listened because I knew it was bound to happen Until everything went quiet for a moment My grandma who owns our house then steps in saying Stop your hurting her Then I realize what s going on and I jump up with my phone in hand recording while walking to the guest room where they were My aunt was choking her She couldn t speak She only got off my little sister when she realized I was recording just to tell me how much she didn t care I then ran out of the house and down the street as fast as I could because my grandma was trying to stop me from calling the police I got far enough to where she could not chase me and called them My aunt was then arrested My grandpa said what I did was wrong Am I the asshole",17,,cousin

text body: For some background my parents split up when I was 7 I lived with my mum but would often spend weekends with my dad I made a post on trueoffmychest talking in detail about what happened and have since told my dad what affect his behaviour had on me but things are still complicated between us I ve recently been wondering what would have happened if I told my mum what was happening at the time and what she would have done I think I will ask her one day but was curious to see other parent s take on this My dad had a blog on tumblr that was just pictures of naked men that apparently had quite a lot of followers and he would spend a lot of time on it Not really a problem but he would be sat next to 14 20 year old me either on his laptop or phone looking at these pictures and making no attempt to hide it from me While it wasn t porn it made me very uncomfortable and I couldn t believe he was looking at this stuff next to me I m sure if you searched up hot naked men on any platform it would give you an idea of what he was looking at Sometimes there were genitals in the pictures sometimes there weren t He has since explained to me that it was a naturist blog how nudity isn t inherently sexual and that he wasn t aroused by what he was looking at While I mostly believe that I still think it s pretty weird if you have to explain the difference between porn and naturism to justify stuff you were looking at around your underage daughter So if it had been your 15 year old daughter who came to you and said my father looks at pictures of naked men whilst sat next to me and it makes me really uncomfortable how would you have responded What actions would you have taken TLDR my dad would look at pictures of naked men in front of me and I want to know how parents would respond to that behaviour",,Female,daughter

text body: Hi all I m F 29 and my Big sis F 31 and brother M 27 I would like to apologize my English is not well versed so please bare with me Thank you We just recently lost our mother age 65 from cancer She was diagnosed last year stage 4 It was all sudden At first we were in denial because no family history in her side died or diagnosed of cancer All died from old age So it s been hard for us For context here is my family story history My Mother was a great housewife She s very hands on us growing up From cleaning washing and cooking oh how I missed her cook foods She s strict but it made us who we are today She s very religious too every night she will prayed with the rosary and her usual prayer for us her children be successful in life Also she prayed for the companies will be working to be not toxic and have good working environment and good officers and bosses I have high respect and very much love her till this day However my father I don t have much any ounce of respect and love for him His previous job is a seafarer According to mom his a great provider when we where young But suddenly he became irresponsible husband Here is the list that he done to us Just to summarize Manhandle my mom especially when he is losing the argument Please take note that mom is 4 10 4 11ft and Father 5 10ft Not going home for 5 years On and off contact Going home from his older sister house his cousin house or in his hometown But not his home with us Multiple mistresses he kept All his older sibling known the mistresses Possible some illegitimate children We don t know Borrowing money to his older sister for us but he lied Which we just known recently during the funeral when one of our cousin tell us this All of us are mad because during that time we have no food I think I was that aged of 13 The money she send to my father was spend in his smoking and drinking M0lesting his two daughters Yes I was a victim at a very young age It happened twice My mother known this and they argued and humiliate my father But we still stayed for the reason of he is the sole provider And I understand why mother stayed We still studying in a private school she doesn t want us to stop studying in a good school for our future Because both of them didn t go to college And education is a must to us Typical Asian Mom but she doesn t care about the grades we have as long as it s passing and we still graduate all good to her Always accusing my mother having a relationship to a family man Which is false Because like I said my mom is very hands on to us she always delivered our lunch in school She always tells us she will go to church and if we want to come with her and we always do If I came home from school I always see her doing laundry cleaning the house cooking for dinner and sometimes asleep We saw everything and our neighbors will tell that my mom doesn t have any relationship with other man only my father Especially last year after mom surgery in myoma and colostomy bag He accused her again having afair Like my ghad my mom is a very introverted person She always stays in the house due to her condition and have time to have an affair My brother stays withe her 24 7 to take care of her He stop working just to take care our mom Always telling my mom and my other cousins have a p0rn video Still false Still grossed and no proof has been made Committed suicide last year because we didn t take care of him Same year as my mom hospitalized and gone to surgery Me and my older sis are paying the rent grocery and all bills And his mad or depressed because we didn t take care of him No when he inflicted stab in his chest he was crying for help and my mother was one who saw what he have done My mom was in distressed me and my brother is the one staying at the hospital just to take care of him When he was discharged he was like proud to tell our neighbors what he have done and tell them that his children is fighting with him No we just ignore him due to lack respect to us and especially my mother Always demanding to give him money for his smoking and drinking This time he is retired from being a seafarer which has no savings and no property to own Me and my older sis income is bare minimum with the bills and groceries are high it s just exact to us and my brother that time is still studying If we didn t give him the money he will act out of control which cause my mom distressed and pleaded us to give him money Currently his working as a daytime security guard in a warehouse He didn t help in our expenses in the house especially the hospital bills But sometimes he always ask us if we have some money It so tiring to understand his situation My mom stayed in her relationship because she still hoping that my father will change till the end She also wants to stop the cycle of broken family from her and my father side She forgave him but didn t forget So in the start of Feb this year my father didn t see her or talk to her Even though we stayed in one small house We always tell him that mom is sleeping And we didn t let him visit her in the hospital as per her request and might cause her more unnecessary stress She was cremated in mother s day which is so hard to us siblings Now me and my siblings are planning to move out from our house My mom is no longer with us and the house is no longer a home without her also we feel we are not safe anymore especially me and my older sister if we stayed But due to expenses and loans we accumulated we might delay the move out Even though we want to move out urgently So

text body: I am a 20 y o dropped out student from some unknown local univ The school that i was in got reported to CHED back then and i didn t really got good grades there even tho i always study the whole syllabus once it was laid out by our profs from first day of our meeting As a kid who was craving attention and seeks affirmation from my mother after i heard my mother bragging about how i learned to read and write at the age of three My little brain went floating on cloud 9 You can probably guess what happened next Obviously i tried my best to get her approval Back then English was a powerful weapon to wield So i learned English at the age of 4 by borrowing my cousin s Dictionary Thesaurus she was a college student Usually you attend pre school before kindergarten here back then and you can t attend kinder if you re only 4 yr old But my step dad was bold enough to make a bet on the school lol He said i can understand most stuffs already so just try making me read write and count As the fool i am i bragged the hell out of me That s how all the sh8 started When i was a Senior High School student my family was never really that much understanding of my situation It was pandemic back then My mother was also a student back then There s this thing called ALS here in ph which allows those who wish to pursue their studies regardless of their age My older sister was in college too back then while the youngest is taking modular classes as a 3rd grade student til 4th grade My parents would always ask me to assist the youngest with her activities and since it was MODULAR where no one can actually teach her i was the one who was teaching her the entire time The funny thing was when it was my turn to do the studying for my own classes and activities they want me to stop whatever i am doing telling me to stop using the pretext of studying to avoid doing chores I took it to heart so i just went ahead and finish all chores before doing mine But at the time it was over it s time to head to bed THEM PEEPS BE turning all the lights off and saying You have all time to do that during the day so just sleep But in the morning there are morning chores At Lunch i have to help making it In the afternoon i have to tutor my li l sis In the evening i have to help with dinner I have a friend group back then who helped me all throughout my senior year However of course they got fed up with me too The fact that i have to cry my heart out whenever i do my activities was nothing less exhausting I loose those friends due to unchanging cycle Back to my college years it was rather disappointing All the efforts i did at home and school are completely overlooked At school i didn t get the grade i deserved it was awful Due to the school not paying the professors properly they were getting back to US their students At home i feel like i was some kind of maid that needs to heed to their every call exhausting it is But what they call me is something else A LAZY BUM My mom was a senior high school already when i get to college She barely did chores due to her busy schedule at school She sometimes have gigs during the night too I was the ONE no the ONLY ONE Who was doing chores at home back then I know all of them are mostly exhausted but how can they belittle the stuffs i did Last year i got fed up and insisted on dropping out my mum had a miscarriage too I told them i was just gonna work and give up studying for now I HATE IT STUDYING I MEAN IM ALREADY SO FED UP STUDYING JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT IS MAKING ME THROW UP I was able to get a job earn and pay bills at home Funnily enough it wasn t taken well I overheard my mother talking with my aunt that there s no way i don t have money since i didn t really spend on anything I WAS THE ONE WHO BOUGHT MOST OF MY SIS NECESSITIES FOR SCHOOL I WAS THE ONE PAYING OUR ELECTRICITY AND INTERNET BILLS WHENEVER THEY ASKED ME FOR SOMETHING I GIVE IT TO THEM YET I HAVE NOTHING TO SPEND ON THE ONLY THING I BOUGHT FOR MYSELF WAS A FRIGGIN PERSONAL LAPTOP WHICH ALL OF US LITERALLY USE Now with the present they want me to enroll again I asked them if i can shift my course but it was for naught My father said i won t earn sh8 My lil sis wants to be on some musical conservatory and study music for college too But when she told our parents the typical asian answer it is HUWAG KAYONG MAS MARUNONG PA SAMIN I get what they mean but why is it our responsibility to make fortune for them We never asked to be here Now im facing something terrible i have always been the yes type of person with them But it s too much If i pursue what they want my lil sis won t be safe from them comparing her to me If i choose not to enroll i am a freaky ungrateful kid Now my mother is saying If you don t enroll i ll be taking your phone and laptop from you GIRL THE PHONE SURE BUT MY PERSONAL LAPTOP THAT I PERSONALLY BOUGHT WITH MY BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS I can t even go out without their permission Now their taking something i use to save some pocket money Am i missing something Or is it fine to feel this way IDK anymore TDLR I don t know what to do with them I want to break free but i don t want to leave my lil sis behind in this exhausting family My sis already left so i can t just leave her behind Is what i feel matter Or should i try to endure some more But if so for how long",20,,

text body: MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING FOR CSA all stated ages are current TLDR I was sexually assaulted by one cousin with whom I am NC but his disabled sister who aided in the abuse is still apart of my life very distantly I do not want to invite her to future events in my life but am unsure if it s the right path Hello this isn t technically relevant to my life right now but I 21F have been thinking about this a LOT recently and was hoping to get some advice insight into this issue I am bound to have as my life goes on For some background when I was a child from ages roughly 6 12 I was habitually molested by my 26M cousin John At the time he was also a child although he was older than I was The abuse for me began after his sister and my best friend at the time Gracie 24F brought me to him and instructed me on what to do For everyone s sake I won t get more graphic than that but know that in every way imaginable Gracie was also a victim of John s and I have always understood that on some level The abuse only stopped because I reached an age where the beginnings of the talk began and I realized exactly how bad the things my cousins made me do were While it had always made me uncomfortable and often hurt I had not realized it wasn t normal behavior as my older cousins both told me it was The last time it ever happened was at a holiday party where John attacked me just a locked door and room away from the rest of our family For the first time all of the trauma came back up and I managed to get the door open and ran to my mom and told her what happened To keep this brief and not reveal every grueling aspect of an already deeply socially awkward child coming to grips with the after affects of that type of trauma I will summarize the next few years Although there was some investigation into the matter it took place a few years after the last occurrence and I was fairly unwilling to cooperate at the time due to feeling like I was tearing our family apart I would come to find out much later that my family had believed that the last incident was the only one and figured I was being dramatic For years I refused to visit that side of the family out of constant fear of not knowing if John would be present My absence was both very unusual for our family and very clearly hurting my mom It took me until I was about 16 to be willing to visit with them again and it was borne out of a desire to make my mom happy and to not let John continue to control and hurt me now that I was old enough to know better and fight back However the anxiety of not knowing if I would have to see him made every visit a crescendo of panic and regression until the point it was either confirmed he was not present or if he was I would then devolve into all out survival mode and hide as best I could As I got older however he began showing up to these events less and less Within the past few years he hasn t come to single event not a single wedding reunion vacation holiday nothing If it s due to not being invited or not coming I do not know My relationship with Gracie too was utterly destroyed She was both John s victim and the person who offered me up to him on a silver platter She couldn t have known better she didn t know better but it doesn t change the fact that every time I look at her all I can see are the flashes of each and every time she was there and either watched or helped her brother None of this is helped by the fact that Gracie was in a car accident when she was young that left her with permanent brain damage and developmental issues Making it even harder for me to deal with these resentments When I was a young teen I lashed out at her exactly one time I still regret my words to this day After that and as I got older I just began to flat out ignore her These days I try my best to engage if she addresses me but I find it extremely hard to look at her directly and my skin crawls every time she hugs me Not many people truly know what happened with Gracie John and me I only told my mother everything that happened this past year and it wasn t an intentional confession I m positive Gracie never told her parents or if she did then they choose to ignore it and support John to this day I cannot emphasize enough how complicated my relationship is with my mom s side of the family They are in general a very close knit group that I am on the outside of due primarily to my own actions but I do love them dearly I do want to be closer to my family I want to be able to engage with them the way my siblings and other cousins can but I will admit many years of self isolation has given me a large disadvantage there When it comes down to it John Gracie and their family is just one part of a much larger involved family that values time spent together very highly The family is big enough that most of the time partners are only introduced if one is VERY sure they re here to stay simply because introductions and questions and bonding takes way too long with that many people and those things very much are an expectation on some level When someone in the family has an event the expectation is if you invite some family you must at the very least extend the invite to them all this is with the exception of child free weddings because we have so many kids in the family inviting them all to weddings can easily add 10 15 people to the guest list which fluctuates as more of my cousins begin to have children And that is exactly what troubles me I m getting to the point where I am thinking about things like getting myself started career wise and eventually getting married But when I think about my wedding the guest list already is posing a huge issue and I am literally still single How am I supposed to go about inviting my family and having them join me for a big life event when I can t stomach the thought of inviting the one cousin everyone protects with their life Gracie has obviously been through a lot aside from what her brother did to us both and those struggles are the only ones the rest of my family is aware of If I don t invite her that would certainly cause problems with not only her family but basically all of my aunts uncles and cousins Revealing the reason why to them feels both so invasive and cruel to Gracie as well How can I bring up the shit she did when we were kids when she will literally never live a normal life thanks to an alcoholic who took lives into their own hands I know to them if I don t invite her and don t explain why I would be a huge insane monster who is bullying the visibly disabled cousin she barely knows anymore But if I do invite her I know my entire wedding all I will think about is how badly I do not want her to be there I don t want her in my wedding photos I don t want reminders of how I can t forgive and forget plastered on my wall But I also don t want to damage what is already a very tenuous relarionship with my family All of this is of course many years away from being relevant to my life But I have been thinking about it a lot recently What do I do If you have any other questions I can clarify them I know this is a long post lots of things were lightly discussed but it s also about two decades worth of twisting and complicated history that may be more relevant than I am giving it credit for given my perspective",21,Female,

text body: I m a 23 year old male This is a long post but please bear with me I m starting to feel absolutely lost in life and i am looking for ways to reconcile my family Some context My mother and father are still married and i have a 19 y o sister My mother has become increasingly insufferable She is miserable with everything if there is something that she can complain about she will It doesn t matter if it is something as little as breathing or the tv volume or how someone walks in the house she will act as if it s the end of the world She is also extremely controlling She forces me as well as my sister to be reliant on her so she has leverage and any time she becomes upset she hangs whatever she can over my head Car insurance is a big one but she will not let me purchase my own car insurance and let me legally re register my vehicle in my name She withholds my legal documents from me attempts to monitor my spending and more Keep in mind i have never done anything to prove i am untrustworthy nor am i finally irresponsible My father and my mother can barely spend 5 seconds in a room together without fighting Her negative attitude is a serious issue and she truly attempts to pick fights with people and holds things over our heads consistently Ultimately this has made for a family dynamic that is utter misery She has caused major issues in my relationship because she gets upset and guilts me whenever i miss a family dinner or I do something without her She is constantly making us feel guilty for lack of doing things and is forcing us to do things for her She complains and calls us all names in front of us if she doesn t get her way She lets little things bother her significantly that shouldn t She also becomes livid when anyone spends any time relaxing on a weekend If we are not working around the house in the backyard or doing something that needs to be done she throws a fit that often leads to a screaming match She will call us lazy while she spends more time on the couch than any of us She has been extremely unsupportive of my business ventures my desire to further my education and any of my hobbies She does not listen to what i have to say about anything i m passionate about and has selective hearing many times She often makes demands on things that we need to do and expects it to be done instantly even if we are wrapped up with something effectively more important like my job given i WFH To put it into perspective she does not have a bad life Financially my family is in a good spot We live in a house in an upper middle class neighborhood that is worth approximately 1m plus my father is the breadwinner and earns over six figures with his own business My mother works a few hours a day for the benefits her job is about 15 minutes away and has off during the summer It is not labor intensive nor require any specific skill She spends a fair amount of time at home during the middle of the day watching TV on the couch My sister and I have always been good kids we have never had any issues always been fairly good students and i personally have succeeded well in my eyes I graduated college 2 years early with a 3 97 and hold a full time job now in my respective career Given my mother s actions my father has become depressed He works at a minimum 10 hours a day but in my mom s eyes it is never enough She makes it all a competition I think she feels like she is cheated because she handles chores around the house but in my fathers defense he is away 12 hours a day so i m not sure when he would have the time to handle cooking a meal or cleaning the house Even if my father did that my mother would find something wrong with it She has severe OCD and is never pleased with how the house is clean We had a maid for a fair amount of time and she would consistently argue the house was not clean when in reality it was spotless you could have eaten off the toilet We can t do any cleaning to her satisfaction nobody can It is almost as if she does things so she can complain about it She does not like cooking she does not like cleaning We go out to eat we go hire someone to clean the house She then will complain about the food at the restaurant or the way the house was cleaned My father has reached a point where now all he does is complain about his life And i can t blame him It is miserable for him from the moment he opens his eyes to the moment he closes them Then there comes my sister She is mostly out of my life We never really got along She is entitled and moody She will do anything in her power to one up me and get a better hand over me I e the other night i got in the shower and she immediately started banging on the door screaming saying she needed to take a shower too She then told my mom keep in mind i am 23 years old My mother has expressed that they are going to pay fund my sisters college tuition and rent which is 3x more than mine while i am on the hook for mine She is consistently looking for vehicles for her and gave her a brand new car when she got her license when i was on the hook for mine So things are not anywhere near equal I m not saying they have to be but i went a few months in college wishing i had more help living on ramen noodles while my sister is having steak dinners with her friends This does not sit right with me My sister recently stated that she wants to go back to college subsequently to her bachelors My mom is in full support of it I on the other hand have been working for a few years piling up as much money as i could so i could go back to school to continue my education because my mother expressed that i would not get any help from them whatsoever the program i want to do is on site and full time so i wouldn t be able to hold a full time job and do school at the same time since i currently work 80 hours a week between my actual work and travel So evidently there is some bias Which is fine However my sister gets whatever she wants She is never criticized She gets slapped on the wrist from my mom She attempts to boss me around despite me being the most educated and almost the highest earning person in the house and often times my mom enforces it You might be saying to yourself why do you listen The truth is if i don t something dear to my heart will be either held over my head or thrown away It doesn t matter how much value it has either sentimentally or monetarily my mom will use any leverage she has to get her way and if you defy her she will make your life a living hell Financially my parents don t support me much I pay my rent at my apartment i pay for my vehicles i pay for my clothes and all my bills They cover my car insurance because all my cars are registered in their name and my phone bill It is maybe 300 month My father does not care but my mom holds it over my head i have no problem paying for these things but she will not let me as i said earlier I often end up going to my childhood home and staying there instead of my apartment because things are held over my head My mom will either say she is going to throw away something of mine that is thousands of dollars that i worked hard for or will make me feel horrible if don t come home Ultimately my mom will say anything to get what she wants she does not care what she says to someone or repercussions it has However if someone treats her with 10 of how she treats me it s the end of the world and she lets it bother her forever and will hold a grudge She is truly a miserable person i use the analogy that she looks at a glass that is 3 4 full and gets pissed because after a few sips it will be 1 2 empty So that brings you up to speed with my family problems Then there is my relationship My girlfriend and i have been together for some time my mom becomes an issue often She gets upset when we do something alone But she weirdly plays both sides I am not perfect and i understand that but you would think when i am venting about something that happened in my relationship she wouldn t go back and say something to my girlfriend but she does She told my girlfriend about what i said to my father that she overheard that was bothering me And she also told her that she is an idiot and let s me walk all over her because my girlfriend lets me use her car since i got into a car accident and my mother made it clear that if i bought a second car she would have thrown away about 10 000 worth of my personal items So the only reason i have her car is because of my mom This has made for a horrible dynamic in my relationship I am put in positions where my mom does not want to spend time with my gf and my gf does it want to spend with my mom They almost make me choose one over the other then one ends up hurt this has destroyed the hobbies that i have and the things that i enjoy In addition my girlfriend gives me zero space and if i ask she makes me feel awful about it I get time to myself when i am in the bathroom or traveling for work but aside from that i am stuck with her or my family I have no free time any more and cant see my friends because if it isn t my mom it s her She consistently makes me feel like what i do is not enough I m sure part of this is on me though for not having a strong foot and being firm with things My relationship has become one sided recently and it is something that i should have better control of Then there is my job I work a lot and am statistically underpaid I log about 80 hours a week and am not compensated well That is on me I was okay getting experience to land a good PhD program or MS program or even a lateral job movement However recently my firm fired everyone but one other person at my level previously 8 now 2 so myself and one other person have to juggle what was once made for 8 people and there is no slack cut on my end I am expected to do more and handle more They have been nitpicking things like my administrative time entries which has increased to coordinate tasks other time entries here and there spent 40 minutes telling me what i did was wrong despite my time being worth 12 minutes and gave me a poor review that was entirely contradictory during the in person interview my manager would say one thing then would subsequently contradict it This has made me increasingly uncomfortable at work I ve been at my firm for almost 3 years now but all of a sudden these little things are issues and everything i m doing is nitpicked from specific manager level people where as others leave me be and let me work as normal and give nothing but good feedback however none of that is reflected in my formal review This has made me even worse mentally I am at a point where i don t know what i should do next The honest solution is to get a new job but between my family my relationship and my current work commitment i don t even know when i could make the time Now i see my friends building some sort of resentment because i often can t spend time with them and or im not there when they might need my help My father has tried to make my mom agree to family counseling but she won t I can t have them get a divorce even though they probably should I should probably get a better grip on my relationship And as for my job i likely just need to find the time to get a new one In summary how do you fix a person that is just purely miserable How do you solve internal family issues with that person Even if that person doesn t have valid reasons to be miserable What would you do in my situation I feel as if i m an optimistic person and a good problem solver but for the life of me i cannot reconcile my family nor make anyone happy anymore no matter what i do Thanks for reading",23,Male,

text body: Hey everyone I 26m I ve been replaced by my stepmother and her kids My parents were never married and were together until I was 10 years old when they broke up my father immediately started dating he ended up getting married when I was 18 The woman he married is foreign and has two daughters both older than me Between going off the college spending half the time with my mother and then after college living in a different state they have effectively cut me out of the house I was living 12 hours away until last year my mother unfortunately was diagnosed with stage for cancer and I rushed home to take care of her She unfortunately passed three months later through the whole process my father was distant and never really offered to assist me at all Since meeting my stepmother when I was 18 we have never really clicked She s foreign but it s very blunt and very superficial But I always kept things very civil and never rock a boat Her daughter s are polar opposites of each other one is very successful and just graduate med school and the other is a total leach of society Since me and my soon to be wife moved to 12 hours away after college my room has been completely dismantled my father barely text me and I feel like a stranger in my own childhood home My stepmother has also made comments about my deceased mother Most not that bad but she made one to my fiancé at her bridal shower that was inexcusable With all that being said everything was going fine until about a week ago when I finally after years of letting it go stood up to my stepmother She has always been nasty judgmental and very pushy with my fiancé It came to head when my Stepmother was harassing my fiancé about wedding invites and everything like that My fiancé finally said please let us deal with it and we will take care of it My stepmother flew off the handle and was incredibly disrespectful So with that encounter and what was said at the bridal shower I decided to have a conversation with my stepmother She denied everything and said my fiancé made it up Which I know is not true and basically stormed off Since that day she is acted like a five year old and avoided me spoken one word to me unconnected with us on her only social media platform and told my extended family that she has nothing to do with the wedding I had to say what I said because without it there wouldn t be a boundary My father and I s relationship has been fine since they ve been married but I always felt like it was a little foreign I don t care about an inheritance or anything like that I just only care about my relationship with my father being he is my only close family member left I m sorry if that was a little confusing but to further explain how I feel like I am not a part of my father s family here are some examples my father takes him out too expensive dinners and on vacations and has never offered to take me out or take me on a vacation or just invited me for me to even pay my own way For their birthdays they go to expensive dinners and I get pizza at the house He bought my stepsister a car off of a family member and I had my truck blow up and there was no word of even offering to help he let my stepmother and stepsister take all the stuff out of my room and put in the basement and gave my room to my stepsister without asking me I am getting married in about a month and instead of helping or offering to help for the wedding he is taking them on an expensive trip I just want to have a healthy and good relationship with my father because he s the last close family member I have left I believe my stepmother knew she was in financial trouble and had no ability to retire when she married my father Upon marrying my father she retired sold her condo and moved right in In a non selfish way I don t care about the Will or anything like that It just hurts me that her and her stepdaughter are getting half of everything if I don t get cut out I m sorry that I rambled if any of you have any advice or have dealt with any of this please leave a comment",26,Male,son

text body: Brief background my parents are lower middle class Maybe at one point they weren t considered that but my dad s income didn t keep up with rising cost of living However my grandpa on my mom s side has a lot of money Tens of millions at least and growing through solid investments My parents net worth is probably around 3 4M which includes our house at market value of 1 5M and nearly 1M in retirement accounts they can t yet touch When I was growing up I wasn t allowed to get a job as school is your job but I wanted to go to senior prom with my friends and by the time I realized I would have to foot the bill I didn t have enough time to make the money by working a minimum wage job So I had sex for money at 17 This started the pattern I worked a summer job before going to college but I had to quit 2 weeks early since my parents booked a vacation I quickly used up that money on food toiletries random life expenses and trying to have a social life My parents wouldn t help out I ended up getting credit cards which started a cycle of me getting deep into credit card many times still now Whenever I would ask for help they would make me feel like if they gave me some money now it would be my fault if some random freak event happened preventing them from working and needing to burn through their money They put their hypothetical future stability above my present needs Now I m deep in debt with a dead end job at 28 living with my parents with no end in sight I needed to quit my job of 4 years after I found out what we do is potentially criminal and being investigated I am applying to go to law school and this would mess me up I asked my parents for a loan so I could quit immediately and not worry about not being able to pay my bills I ve never really asked for a lump sum of money before a few thousand would ve been enough for me to quit but my parents attitude is both the thing about their future financial security and that bailing me out won t teach me a lesson I ve learned a million lessons in my life and I can t escape this cycle and I ve been working for years trying so it s not like I m lazy or lack ambition I m just stuck and won t be able to pay for law school if I don t get out of the debt death spiral My question is is it normal for parents who can afford it to help out their children until they are fully established I m just thinking what I would do if I was a parent Or do most parents sit on top of piles of money that would pay for their life for the next 25 years and watch their kids suffer and just wash their hands of it feeling no sense of responsibility or remorse I feel like everyone I know from high school to college all have their own place or with roommates are getting married and having nice engagement photos outfits events but are definitely not earning enough money to pay for all of the necessities plus have such a cushy lifestyle Leading me to believe at least in my circles when parents CAN help out they do It makes me feel like my parents are unwilling to prop me up until I have enough runway on my own because they don t believe I ll ever succeed TLDR stuck in a never ending debt loop a pattern that started when I was a kid due to parental distortions on their own financial situation that I ll never be able to make enough money to get out of without outside help Am I crazy for thinking my parents should help if they can Especially knowing I had sex for money as a teenager because they refused to let me get an actual job but wouldn t help me pay for just one thing that everyone else gets to participate in at the end of high school despite being able to afford it but framing it that they can t",28,,

who wants you to prioritize them in everything we are both adults she will be 23 and I will be 22 soon How to deal with someone who wants to be the best sister and the best sibling and child in everything the one they often talk about and whom they often talk well about she wants to be the main subject and the it girl to everyone even other people outside of family in her every workplace she had to be the hero and the golden person whom they all adore and whom almost all are afraid of so she has the control and power she aint afraid to brag about wanting everyone to fear her it doesnt just stop at her workplace but everyone must be afraid of her for her to feel better about herself for her to feel in control and for her to feel like some sort of queen fear some people have for her is only feeding her ego and making her even more disgusting person She often brags about being the best out us sisters and the most desired I am the youngest girl in our family not just from siblings but from whole family she is the second youngest after me in the whole family She is the golden child my mother has way too much narc traits but she mother isnt and probably wont be diagnosed by health professional about her being a narc she doesnt like going to them bc she cant and she wont make an effort to even see her mistakes and her wrong doings the thing professionals ask her to think about she doesnt like them holding her accountable she always must be the victim she hasnt apologized even once for any of her mistakes not even little ones she is a person nobody normal wants to be around other than those similar to her I for most part ignore my mother bc there aint no healthy way to deal with that woman other than ignoring My mother uses and abuses if she can other people to get what she wants she often spins the stories to match her narrative of her always being a victim and often than not people dont like her acting like victim and they dont like that weak mindset so they mostly avoid her like the plague I still have to live here bc its too expensive in my country I live with them both I might be able to move out in next 2 to 3 years and I most likely plan to move further away from our town so I cant be around them at all but until then I have to protect my sanity My sister when we were teens like 15 16 years old when we were alone did confess to me that she is jealous of me being smarter than her and for having better grades than her thats the first and the last compliment of hers that I got I think she said that then bc she wanted me to validate her and make her feel better about herself bc she was down at time about the guy and she wanted to say that so I could give her even more attention validation and compliments she was fishing for compliments maybe even for me to say oh no that aint true you are smarter and other bullshit just so she can feel better bc she does feel better and more powerful if someone has it bad in life she feeds of someone being weaker worse and in worse position than her she feels happy about it too She feels powerful and good about putting someone down she adores gossiping and being the center of attention when we were teens she loved to put me down about me still being a virgin while she wasnt she loved to use the point of me not being that much social as to explain why I am still a virgin she loved to rub that shit in my face bc she felt like winner that I am a virgin loser in her eyes with almost no friends while she is the desired sister who everybody wants to either f or hang out with or be whom older guys invite to their parties and their hanging outs I wouldnt keep silent if she attacked me about that I didnt have any problem with me being a virgin nor with me having few friends nor me not going to parties with older guys and I never spoke about it in any way I never mentioned it not even to talk about it let alone complain about it it just wasnt an issue to me so she didnt touch into painful spot but her ego thought that thats my painful spot aka perfect spot to hit at she thought I wanted to be like her that I was jealous of her that I felt like loser for not being like her for not getting the attention she got from people she was also ashamed of me yeah full on ashamed of me for simple me being me I didnt like her as person but I loved her as sister so that did hurt bc it was coming from someone I cared and loved someone I cared and loved wanted to hit me under the belt and to make me feel worse about myself no matter if she didnt hit the spot it did hurt that someone I loved was actively trying to shot me down in hopes to make themselves feel better and more powerful but oh well what can I do about it other than feel hurt and cry so I just kept to my side I kept doing what I wanted and being me something she hated bc she saw her effort at dragging me down hurting me didnt work I kept to myself and was letting her be whatever she wanted she didnt like the lack of attention from me and she didnt like me being better than her in school so she kept trying to break me down trying to make me feel as loser kept trying to make me hate myself kept trying to make me better aka her bc she thought everyone should be like her for them to not be a shame and she wanted me to be her for me to not keep embarassing her and for her to not feel ashamed of me Over the years she kept changing tactics from outright nasty and very explosive to silent under the belt when she would see that most of them didnt work she would mostly lose the ones that made me keep her at the arms length so she would try things like love bombing hot and cold suddenly agreeing suddenly having the same opinions about things like me suddenly being open and vulnerable about some things bc she knows I am empathic person and etc I would for most part ignore her I also would stop sharing stuff about my life with her which made her lack knowledge knowledge that she had to have to be able to target and attack me in hopes of again having control of me and she had to make me stop at one point before she moved to live with her ex bf when the abuse got worse she had friends that behaved just like her that also gave me her attitude and that were jealous at me for the same things she was they expected me to just lie down like a good dog and take it for them to be able to control and punish me when I misbehaved once I defended myself from their punishment showed them their place they acted all like they are the real victims that I am the villan who wants to do them harm bc I am jealous of them most people believed their shit bc sucha beautiful hot well known nice girls cant be sucha a bad people I must be making that up outta my jealousy That was from people that mostly used their d instead of their brain or that werent really smart I dont want my life to be in constant silent war zone I dont want the replay of the past so I am looking for advice on this lunacy So yeah how do you deal with someone who wants you to give them advices attention validation but also to not bc often if you give them advice they go ooh dont be acting smarty pants with me she is often using the line of me being smarty pants for almost everything like I remember the word she cant remember in our convo and all of sudden I am acting like smarty pants and she feels the need to put me in my place about me doing something bad its pathetic lame and childlish when she does that I often just look at her as if to ask her are you dumb or just pretending I dont really like fights so I dont start them but damn straight do I finish them when someone like her starts with their nonsense I dont like drama to disturb my peace bc there are more ways to talk calmly and openly about something other than drama in past I tried those with her but all she understands is dirty play dramatic childish insulting ways to tell someone something trying to harm and make someone feel bad all bad shit I defend myself and I dont hold my tongue when she starts but she doesnt like that so she starts with threats bc she doesnt like me talking back to her she is acting like my parent but also as if I am her slave thats her behaviour since I can remember it stopped for some time after she moved out mainly bc she had others victims also bc we were no contact I cut her out my life so when she saw that she changed tactics bc she no longer had her main victims attention and the way to get to her so suddenly she apologized for everything she didnt list everything she was sorry for she and her bf moved closer so she had access again and she had the key of our childhood home I still didnt trust her and didnt fall for her love bombing but I had some type of civil relationship just so there is no drama and no awkwardness in begining she was all good and better than before but I could see thro most of it but then few weeks ago the b returned to live in our childhood home and is again acting like her past immature self the one that I cant stand we had 3 fights yeah real fights since she returned she started every time with her bullshit I did fight back and then she would attack me with her hands and I would fight back and she lost every damn time from the start but still the heck whats with that behaviour I cant go to the police bc our police doesnt meddle in family problems and relationships there were some really disturbing cases of family abuse and parents killing their children and themselves there was also a case of a woman killing her sister and freezing her in her freezer of their childhood home she kept her there 15 years until the blackout of electricity happened body unfroze started smelling and she was found the sister was caught and is now in prison the dead girl was conducted as missing so yeah police only reacted when there were dead bodies when it was too late In past before she moved out I tried to involve police but yeah it went on healthy but deaf ears and also my mother wouldnt throw out her favourite child after all she is hers golden child even thro she is just chaos trouble and poison toxic in a form of human So I am asking How do you deal with someone who wants to punish you when you dont listen to them who says you are talking back when all you are trying is to defend yourself something that you shouldnt do when dealing with them according to them yeah at one point she said that I deserve all the abuse I get bc I am talking back and I shouldnt talk back to her She thinks she is my God my hero my everything the one saving me from me being me and making bad decisions She thinks I should be grateful for her even giving me an ounce of her attention and her time How do you deal with someone who is full of crap and who wants all the control someone who acts like all that is normal expected of you bc you are underneath them and bc you arent being a good little slave to them when thats all that is expected of you how to deal with someone who often punishes you with abuse or with threats of abuse if you dont react and act how they want you they often end up hitting or insulting you and when you fight back you are the villan and she is the victim someone who thinks you are their slave that shouldnt talk back to them or even look at them wrong I am not person to attack first I act only in self defense but this b is really testing my self control bc all I want is to b at her up for her behaviour Here I am hoping she messes with wrong person and gets her s handed back to her by that person that she calms the hell down out of fear embarrassment TLDR older sister golden child is using almost everything in the book of abusing to gain control and make someone a good sla ve for personal gain and I am looking for advice on how to deal with her crap and ways to stay sane also on what to do after I move out to keep her others in my family similar to her out my life for good",21,,sibling

author: DryNefariousness7309
text body: I m reaching out here because I feel completely stuck and I m hoping other parents especially dads might relate to what I m going through Since our son was born life has obviously changed dramatically as I expected Lack of sleep hormones the sudden shift in priorities all of it puts a huge strain on your relationship and that s nothing new to anyone who s been through it But one thing I didn t really anticipate was the way my partner seems to have changed not just in herself but in how she relates to other people particularly my side of the family I ve tried to be supportive patient and understanding but lately it feels like I m stuck between the family I was raised with and the family I m trying to build I don t know whether to chalk it all up to postnatal changes emotional overwhelm or whether these are signs of something more permanent maybe even a mental health concern or just a fundamental difference in values when it comes to family and parenting Some specific behaviors and conflicts have come up and I d really appreciate your thoughts on whether these are common or if I m missing something important Photo Boundaries My partner gets really upset if friends or family take a photo of our son I ve never had an issue with this and grew up around people constantly snapping pictures It feels like she s being overly controlling sometimes like she s gatekeeping who gets to take or see photos of him Sharing Photos I m also with her on not posting pictures of our son on social media that was actually my idea but if I send a picture to my mum and she forwards it to extended family my nan etc my partner sees it as a serious breach of trust and a safeguarding issue I see it more as proud grandparents sharing joy Is that such a bad thing Possessive Language She gets bothered if someone says things like my boy or our baby about our son To me it s just a harmless affectionate thing family say She says it makes her feel like she had this baby for other people not herself Distancing from Friends She s cut off most of her friends who haven t been in much contact since the birth I figured they were just giving us space to settle into our family life and honestly none of my mates have really reached out either but I didn t take it personally Communication With My Family My partner was once close to my family but now thinks each of us should only coordinate plans with our own families She doesn t like it when my mum messages her directly and I don t understand that I thought she was part of the family now and could talk to my parents without going through me Body Image Intimacy She s really struggling with how she looks post pregnancy She won t be in photos she avoids intimacy and she gets offended when my dad says things like you re looking lovely in a completely harmless way I think he means well but she just shuts down I ve tried reassurance but nothing I say or do seems to help Distrust Toward My Family She says she doesn t trust my family to watch our son but is totally fine leaving him with her mum I find this so unfair as I know my family would do a great job Forgiveness My mum kissed our son when he was a newborn which my partner was furious about But we never laid down that boundary beforehand My mum was simply unaware of the dangers as are over half of UK parents acoroing to a poll I see it as a learning moment that we were to blaim for as we did not clearly state this beforehand My son was fine thankfully but my partner says it is unforgivable and the things people say or do in the early stages of motherhood are never forgotten Visitors Time Together She doesn t like having visitors over even though I m totally fine with family popping in I get that we re building our own family now and need space but at the same time her mum is over way more than anyone else Our son needs his other grandpartents in his life as well so it just feels inconsistent Not Letting Others Hold Him She doesn t like anyone else holding our son even for a short time She says she hates when he comes back smelling like someone else That one honestly just seems excessive to me Routine Over Everything She s militant about our sons routine I respect that and it does work but it also means she ll cancel plans with family or skip planned days out just to keep the schedule intact I d rather risk a rough night and go make some memories together but for her the routine comes first Lack of Connection She s not interested in going on dates or even planning short breaks anymore I know things are harder with a baby but I still want us to have that time It feels like we ve lost us and she doesn t seem to want it back Hostility Toward My Mum and Dad This one really hurts She gives my family cold responses avoids eye contact and it s created so much tension My fmaily love her to bits and are so upset that she doesnt seem to like them anymore I get that some of this stems from some of the points mentioned above but do they merit being rude and distant She d never act that way toward her own family I guess what I m trying to say is I love my partner and she s an amazing mum and she s gone through a lot But the way she s been handling relationships especially with my side of the family is really weighing me down We ve talked and argued about it many times and I still feel stuck I honestly don t know Are these just normal post baby behaviors that pass with time Is this a sign of anxiety trauma or deeper emotional stuff that needs professional help Or is this just who she is now and I need to either accept it or walk away I don t want to be the insensitive guy who doesn t get it I also don t want to give up on my family or keep defending behaviors that feel isolating and unfair So if you ve been through anything like this or have any advice on how to handle it then I d really appreciate hearing your experience I m standing at a crossroads right now and could really use some outside perspective",,Male,father

text body: Hello I hope this is okay to post here So I 18F have had issues with my dad 48M pretty much my whole life I am not sure why I think part of the reason is because we are very similar and also there is a lot of pre existing baggage But I dunno I wanna know if im part of the problem too since I can t really recognise it in myself and everyone I have talked to about it are biased in my favour so it would help to have an unbiased perspective on this My memory is very poor but I will do the best I can I don t remember much of my childhood but I remember I had a lot of issues when I was young I was a very angry and often violent autistic child and he dealt with it on ways that I think messed me up in some ways The two main things I remember are him physically sitting on my and restraining me and also removing the lock from my door This is when I was under 11 btw and he has done this again recently when im 18 I will get to that I mean I don t know what he could ve done but I really don t think this was the answer Also he was always very touchy with me and hugged me and grabbed me when I always made it very clear how much I hated that And he refused to respect my boundaries he seemed to think he was entitled to physical affection from me when that s just not how I am at all He was always one of those very punishment centred parents If I didn t do what he wanted he d take things away from me I think it s been pretty obvious my whole life that that parenting style is very much to my detriment but he refuses to change I really feel like he has very little consideration for me or my emotions I really wish I could do a better job at describing all this but unfortunately I mainly only remember the ways they hurt me and not the context But Is any of this stuff justifiable But here is something that has been happening recently that I do remember better I dropped out of 11th grade and am unemployed since I struggled a lot with school and basically executive dysfunction is holding me back from everything in my life lol Admittedly I am very lazy and do not like helping in the house at all and he has been Pretty harsh on forcing me to do it lately which Here are some of the things he s done taken my phone for a week took the doorknob off my bedroom door again when I was 18 tried to take it off A SECOND TIME threatened to take my yarn away crocheting is one of my 2 hobbies took away the family ipad until I changed my attitude I use it to draw my other hobby it really seems stupid to punish me by taking away the few productive things I do guilt tripped me about my mum having a rough time installed a parental app on my phone to limit my internet again I am 18 regularly threatens to take my phone randomly wrenched my phone out of my hand while I was talking to my mum because he decided I hadn t done enough oh yeah he literally wrestles me to take my phone when I try to resist and does not care that he hurts me pointed out the kid who lives next to me who is the same age as me who helps with the construction zone next door the whole day insinuating I am a failure for not being the same likes to insinuate that I am manipulative and abusive TO HIM okay yeah this sounds bad but I am very stubborn and unhelpful I do understand to a degree but he takes it much too far I think ok yeah this has become very ranty I apologise Just I know he grew up in a very traditional family who was far worse than this Is this some sort of generational trauma thing Is any of this justifiable Is he just Straight up abusive or am I part of the problem too sorry this really turned into a massive rant oops thank you for reading this if you did oh no how the hell do I write a tldr for this TLDR My dad has done some seriously messed up stuff to me but I am unsure if I am part of the problem too or if it is unjustifiable Edited for horrible formatting",18,Female,daughter

text body: TW discussion of sensitive topics I m going to start with my parents My father is in his early 70s and my mom is in her mid 50s I m 19 My father Landed our family into huge debt at least 50k worth of debt before I was even born it was with good intentions he bought and tried to run a supermarket he wanted his children to have something to inherit but it was REALLY naive and he didn t do research beforehand so his gamble failed Okay so he used my mother s credit to pull out loans for the supermarket presumably and that destroyed my mom s credit Even 10 years after the whole debt thing happened she had trouble renting apartments and probably couldn t get a mortgage due to her low credit etc Kept job hopping when I was a kid my mom said the reasons for job hopping were petty and I did hear about an incident in which he argued with his boss could not accumulate savings Had 3 strokes Last one made him physically disabled 2 years ago he refused to seek medical care either because he thought it would be expensive we told him he had medicare insurance or he thought he could recover on his own He can t work anymore and is retired contributes to the family via his Social Security and occasionally cooks I ve had to cook breakfast for him almost every day since that happened I also occasionally cook dinner or help to cook dinner All of this at the cost of my time Alcoholic even now at least 1 cup of sake per day In the past he used to get upset if I couldn t bring him back champagne on the day he wanted it My mom said he almost died once due to alcohol poisoning he drank because that was the custom when you worked in a restaurant environment back then but that was at least 2 decades ago My parents used to argue a lot back then and some of the arguments were so bad that my dad would exhibit suicidal behavior or threaten to commit suicide police were called 2 3 times and I saw these things before I even turned 18 I used to have nightmares about it and still do even if it s rare now I remember when I was a kid 10 11 I lied to my dad about doing my homework and when he caught me he locked me out of the house until my mom intervened I don t remember all of it My mother is the one who pays for the rent utility bills etc not him He has disregarded my mom s physical condition at times my mom has hypertension I ve helped him handle paperwork before I helped him sell his car helped him book flights etc I can excuse some of this due to him being unfamiliar with using computers Okay I remember there was a time when my mom put her elbows on the dinner table while eating which made my dad very angry so he shouted at her to remove her elbows from the table My mom reacted by just leaving the dinner table all together and made a comment that was something like you don t pay rent you don t get to tell me what to do and then the morning after that my dad went to me and was like you need to educate her on how to be American He sometimes thinks that the unintentional mistakes my mom made were intentional Used to get upset at my mom for not being on time still does I took him to a clinic a few days ago 5 6 25 and when he was at the clinic he was impatient and anxious When his blood pressure was checked it read 163 110 so really bad high stroke risk He coped and denied that it was a problem said he was just nervous in hospital like settings and that sitting down constantly made it rise Said that if he had to wait longer for the doctor he would leave Very disappointing experience for me Expects me to give my opinion on things when I ve watched him have the most intense arguments with my mother My mother Believes in QAnon and other conspiracy theories this started around 2021 I suspect it s a coping mechanism because she couldn t make sense of what was happening in the world and also due to our family s financial instability she was buying Trump dollars because she thought they would grow in value due to my father being retired and her self employment My mother wants to pursue her project of starting a YouTube channel I m NOT JOKING and then has to balance her work with that too she said she hates her work now due to how stressful it is so now she s asking me to help with paperwork yes I do get paid but not according to regular rates and usually out of nowhere Some of it is stressful because of deadlines and I can t get anything wrong in the paperwork she works in immigration law My mom is in medical debt At least 10k She accumulated the debt after she went to the hospital due to SVT and then she asked me to sign her up for Medi Cal retroactive coverage I helped her fill out applications that I barely understood I was like 17 18 but yeah and we were denied because there was contradictory information in the application and my mom didn t bother applying again since that happened I ve had pretty bad allergies and my mom always said she would take me to the doctor eventually but never did Probably because neither of us has medical insurance coverage My mom genuinely doesn t see any value in my college education She has told me that I m learning fake things and that my education doesn t matter and then disregards the time I use for my studies My mom won t let me take the bus unless she s with me Afraid I ll get human trafficked When I was a kid my mom would tell me to talk to my dad for her and I did make dumb mistakes like omitting something because I was afraid my dad would respond poorly or being vague and this would result in miscommunication But the whole reason why she asked me to talk to him was because she didn t want to Lacks a strong sense of time possibly severe time blindness Good news my mother sympathizes with me and says I should have been allowed to go do things that every other kid was doing after graduating instead of being confined to rigid schedules and being at home taking care of my father Hasn t paid her car registration fees since 2021 probably around 1k Also hasn t paid her taxes since 2017 An actual sovereign citizen believes the US is under admiralty law and not common law believes a license registration isn t necessary to drive Both They re both telling me to get a job learn how to drive I have until May to get my driver s license They didn t ask me to take online classes but I did it because I knew my mom would make me late for classes she s busy and doesn t have time to drive 30 minutes to drop me off I also needed more time to take care of my dad initially They didn t ask me to sacrifice my dreams but I did anyway because I know that when my mom retires both of my parents probably won t be able to afford a comfortable retirement even with SSA because we live in California I wanted to pursue my dreams of being an artist writer but I pushed them aside in favor of a more financially stable career field accounting Something that will probably make me miserable long term Both are experiencing health issues that require them to either stop working or work less my dad with his physical disability my mom with her hypertension high blood pressure My mother told me that she stayed with my father despite the intense arguments and stuff they are completely incompatible because she wanted me to have a father but I d literally rather be fatherless than have this My mother has casually said things like If he died we would be better off in her native language so he doesn t hear it What about me Extremely burnt out as of 5 10 2025 I dropped my classes because I was failing them and I didn t have time for them anymore I will try again next semester Current conditions Living paycheck to paycheck basically My mother is looking for jobs for both of us for the sake of financial stability

text body: Hi Redditors I m a graduate student from Asia and I ve been struggling with something for a long time that I d like to ask for your insight on Before I get into the details I want to mention that English is not my first language Although I ve tried to polish the text with GPT I apologize for any mistakes that may remain In my family there s my dad mom and an older sister While we don t have much money we ve always been a warm and close knit family I ve always trusted my family deeply and they ve been the support that s helped me get through graduate school Especially my sister she has always been my emotional anchor We used to talk about everything from what we ate each day to our thoughts on love and relationships I felt I could trust her with anything and I believed she would never hide anything from me at least that s how it used to be a year ago But everything changed about a year ago I started noticing that she seemed distracted whenever we talked I often had to repeat myself once or twice before she would understand and respond and she would suddenly ask unrelated or random questions At first I thought maybe she was just dealing with something stressful Later I found out that she had started dating her first boyfriend at school she s still pursuing further studies The thing is I only learned about it after they had been together for a while In fact I was one of the last people in the family to find out I m not sure whether she intentionally kept it from me or not but from that moment on it felt like my world started falling apart It crushed me to realize that someone I had trusted so completely someone I would never have hidden anything from had hidden something so important from me Since then I ve become emotionally unstable I started questioning everything related to her But that wasn t even the worst part I used to think that while I wasn t particularly outstanding at least I was a normal person But since then I ve started having unwanted thoughts and vivid images of my sister being intimate with another man I can t stand it It feels unbearable that there s a side of her I ll never get to see that someone else a man gets to experience a version of her that I never will These thoughts have started to deeply interfere with my life I can t focus on my studies Even seeing a message or photo related to my sister makes me feel irritated and overwhelmed And I honestly don t even know whether what I m feeling is some kind of protective instinct as a family member or something more inappropriate a possessiveness toward her as a woman Eventually after living under this mental pressure for so long I decided to talk to her about it I told her that I might have developed feelings for her that aren t appropriate for siblings and that I couldn t treat her the same way I used to before she had a boyfriend but I also told her I would never act inappropriately or cross a line She didn t judge or ridicule me She said maybe it was just because I had spent too much of my life in male dominated engineering environments and hadn t had much interaction with women She said I wasn t a weirdo She also explained that she s shy about romantic matters which is why she didn t talk to me about it But what I still don t understand is why when she used to say I was the family member she trusted the most was I not the first person she told She even said that she talks to her boyfriend about family problems How is it that someone she just started dating gets to know about our family issues while I the one she used to trust the most didn t even know she was in a relationship If things had ended there maybe I could have slowly worked through it and recovered But recently at a family dinner I found out at the last moment that she had invited her boyfriend to join us Even when friends invite someone to dinner they usually ask if everyone is okay with it in advance because not everyone is comfortable eating with strangers But none of my family not even my sister considered how I might feel It made me feel like there was no one in the world I could trust anymore I was in so much pain but I still forced myself to attend the dinner Seeing her and her boyfriend being affectionate laughing together it was suffocating Afterward the disturbing fantasies I had started having about her and other men became even clearer and more intense I now frequently have nightmares about her and her boyfriend mocking me and I ve been struggling with insomnia In the daytime the intrusive thoughts worsen and I can t accomplish anything just endless pain So I ask you kind Redditors Am I truly some kind of sick weirdo who wants an incestuous relationship with my sister How can I process these emotions How can I get my life back on track I feel completely lost and hopeless",,,sibling

text body: This whole situation started around 10 years ago and just got more out of hand in recent years especially within the past 3 4 years About 10 years ago my sister started this whole thing by cutting out our father From what I hear about is that my sister was calling my father to ask him something about our half brother s wedding that we were attending back in 2013 Apparently our father answered the call in a tone that she didn t like She got mad from that and sometime within the year she cut him off entirely Our father still doesn t know why she won t talk to him 12 years later Myself our mother our stepfather at the time half sister half brother sister in law and her own husband all wanted for her to at least try to contact our father all failed attempts Things were calm for years until 2021 Our older half sister was getting married and a few months before the wedding she and the older half sister got into an argument about something I don t know I m not going to put words in mouth if I don t know what those words were One thing lead to another and eventually our brother in law was somehow dragged into the argument Luckily the wedding went off without a hitch but my sister hasn t tried to contact the older half sister since then Our older half sister as tried to reach out and wanted to make attempts to talk things out but she was not responding eventually our older half sister stopped trying Next was 2022 The year she got married And her next cut We have a half brother who lives out of state and she asked me for his phone number to wish him a happy birthday and to ask when the next time he will be in state will be He did not respond until that night But that was all it took She never made another attempt to reach out to him again she did not even invite him to her wedding Leading up to her own wedding our mother and stepfather at the time were rocky in their relationship ended up filing for divorce about a month later However our mom basically had to convince her to invite our half sister to the wedding The half sister did come but only for the ceremony Which brings up the next cut our niece the half sister s daughter When planning the wedding our niece was promised to be a flower girl About a month out she decided to switch our niece out for her husband s nieces who lived about three hours away Our niece got mad from that and now wants nothing to do with my sister Now 2023 In the beginning of the year our mother was going to take a vacation I lived with our mother at the time and we had a dog One thing I should mention is that our mother and stepfather at the time paid for her wedding and their eventual honeymoon So our mother said that she will forget the money that they paid if she would help me take care of the dog while I was at work Everything was going well at first then one day she messages me while I was at work I work evening and nights saying that she wasn t going to take care of the dog anymore I was currently on the clock and almost 30 minutes from the house When I got home the dog was in a dark house almost no water and did his business in the living room No explanation on why she just decided to stop She just did I was lucky to have a good friend who lives close by to come by and took care of the dog while I was gone Lastly early 2025 While myself and her were not on speaking terms the dog got sick Our mother was out of state at the time and she had to beg for her to help me transport the dog to the vet where we unfortunately had to put the dog down She messaged me the next day to see how I was doing I said I was good and what I did that day Got nothing in return She went back to her old ways I ve reached out to her and still got nothing TLDR That was about six family members that she ended up cutting out her life father half sister half brother niece mother myself for weird puzzling or no reasons at all I still have her contact info but I ve tried to reach out and not doing it again If she does reach out I will answer but I tried extending an olive branch and my arm is getting tired from holding it",38,,sibling

text body: I m not even sure how to start this post I m at a loss for what to do My niece 11yo and nephew 13yo are running rampant on their single dad I am not technically a guardian but I am the next point of contact and am in their lives regularly although not enough apparently They have been through a lot their mother has not been in the picture for many years now and has chosen a lifestyle of drugs and alcohol and on off homelessness They haven t been to school in weeks they sneak out most nights have been brought home by local PD multiple times Their father has all but given up on them I could write another entire post about him he says he can t physically force them to get out of bed or force them to go to school The schools won t help either They are far past the point of being indefinitely grounded and all valuable things taken from them They simply do whatever they want take whatever they want and do not feel remorse and are not motivated to partake in conventional activities that other children their age do I m trying desperately to help steer them in the right direction and humanize them and have emphasized the importance of community but they want nothing to do with it and their father doesn t seem to understand either Essentially they have no structure no real accountability and no real hobbies or things to give them confidence as young humans There are more details and stories I am happy to share in the comments if the need arises TL DR My niece and nephew are off the rails and heading down a dark path help please",,,uncle

author: maureen1231
text body: Many parents presume that an informal chat with their kids is a good way to pass down their family s history and values When I was young my mom and I had several such conversations while sitting around watching old movies on TV She had fond memories of growing up in an idyllic lumber community in Michigan s Upper Peninsula Not surprisingly because I was barely a teenager I was unaware of the importance of these off the cuff chats It never occurred to me to take notes or write it down As I aged I forgot most of the details It wasn t until some years afterward that I began serious family research In the end as a result of spending time with extended family in childhood occasional conversations with my mom and dad and genealogy research I was pretty well grounded in my family roots and values though we never talked about it in those terms My education occurred in stages haphazardly until I began serious genealogy research There is still a lot that I do not know Not many people have the time and energy to delve deeply on their own A few years ago alarmed at the amount of information people were taking with them to their graves I created a simple way for everyone to write their life stories for posterity one decade at a time However I recently ran across an article outlining a systematic way to transfer knowledge from one generation to the next that nicely complements writing it all down This article bylined by Sarah Hallmark Brower advocates taking inventory of the skills knowledge and strengths of family members and devising ways such as storytelling evenings and skill sharing workshops to transfer the information to the family group A few of the suggestions Monthly Workshops On a rotating schedule each family member regardless of age leads a hands on workshop to share their unique skills and traditions from woodworking to cultural practices to demonstrating how to make family recipes Storytelling Evenings Storytelling evenings provide a designated time for elders to share personal narratives family anecdotes and insights gained over a lifetime Skill Sharing Circles During skill sharing circles family members take turns sharing their unique skills fostering a culture of continuous learning within the family and ensuring that a diverse range of talents is passed down through the generations Documenting Family Wisdom Families use this segment to preserve and pass down family knowledge and traditions via things like written records and videos This ensures that essential skills cultural insights and cherished stories are not lost with time Through all of these methods and more Documenting family wisdom becomes a cherished endeavor preserving our unique identity and cultural values Nothing tops the permanence of the written word if carefully preserved But combining a written life story with an ongoing family process of passing down knowledge and skills is unbeatable Click subscribe or sign up at maureensantini substack com subscribe to receive these newsletters without interruption The signup form shows paid options but you are welcome to click no pledge",,Female,

author: Decent-Rope314
text body: TLDR My aunt thinks she s my mother and engages in what i believe is predatory behavior bc of it i don t think it s possible to sum this up without core details to get the full picture so if anyone needs more context let me know This woman has been in my life since i was born she was there for my birth and since that day she s engaged in extremely concerning behaviors first of all i want to give some light context into her character before i get into this she s always been obsessed with men she would skip family gatherings she would start jobs in the same field as the man she wanted to pursue she would obsess and i mean OBSESS over whatever niche or interests her boy toy of the month was into she would dig through their trash she would look through their windows and so much more but strangely when the man she was harassing finally decided to give her a chance all the sudden she wouldn t want them anymore so fast forward to my birth once i was born she essentially used me to get into a man s house so they could play pretend family in hopes of him letting her get in his pants long story short that didn t work and all of that attention for him suddenly shifted towards me she would REFUSE to let me go home to my mother she would tell strangers that my mother abandoned me was on drugs and generally would manipulate toddler me with grand gestures and purchases to get me to trust her fast forward to today and a lot of family drama later i m now 18 and it s just gotten worse to the point i feel violated Here s just a few highlights she knows i don t like to be touched so she s attempted to pay me for hugs i don t accept she constantly leaves bag fulls of random stuff on my porch knowing it makes me uncomfortable she s broken into my house i wanna say 8 times now to the point of having to get my locks changed i ve caught her looking through my door window when i ignore her she will blow my phone up with paragraphs of empty apologies and offers of financial support multiple phone calls she s also shown up to my work she will offer complete strangers to her that she knows i m close with food money clothes in a way to get closer to them to get to me and so much fucking more that i don t have the energy to get into every time ive confronted her she goes straight to gaslighting and manipulation i ll provide proof if needed i ve asked her every which way to stop i ve been nice neutral hostile whatever you can think of i ve done but she cannot take no for an answer but what compelled me to post about this today right now even after going thru this same shit for years are these pictures i received on my porch as i mentioned previously she likes to leave shit on my porch bc she thinks it s cute there was a bag left a few days ago that i didn t go through til today bc ive been disturbed by recent events i can make a second part explaining more if needed upon checking it i found an envelope with printed pictures of myself spanning across the last 5 years except in almost every picture my friends were cropped out and my face was ZOOMED IN on i m talking 3 5 people per picture just gone bc she has that large of a fixation on my face and even on her phone every group picture containing me is zoomed in and cropped i ve refused her to take pictures since probably 2018 for that reason i personally just think that s disgusting and weird behavior the last big thing ill mention here is she bought a whole second CAR just bc she was offended that she wasn t gonna be the one to co sign my loan i can t be any more literal i had plans to get my loan within the next few days of my mom test driving the car i told her about it the bitch went and BOUGHT THE CAR THE SAME DAY just bc her obsession with being NEEDED told her that obviously i can t get the vehicle by myself i NEED her and i NEED to take it from her i m not taking that car and it s upset her soo badly but im just at the point of pure disgust for how far she s willing to cross my boundaries that i don t even care if im missing out on a cheap hell even FREE car bc it s all a disgusting mentally unstable ploy to make her feel like i need her and like she s my mother and i genuinely don t know what to do at this point i feel sadness anger disgust violation and sm more and everyone in my life feels either 2 ways about it they think i should manipulate her into getting free shit or you re enabling her behavior just ignore her and i don t think these people understand ive tried fucking everything i just feel so alone and need to know im not crazy for feeling violated by her behavior and feeling violated in regards to her inability to take NO as an answer i m sorry this is long my dms are open if more proof is needed ty for reading i also wanna say that im gonna copy and paste this to other subs but by no means am i trolling or making this shit up i wish i just need more eyes to see this and im hoping someone understands where im coming from i just feel so so alone and i dont know what to do with this",18,,niece/nephew

text body: I ve never experienced such loneliness in my entire life It s been a year and a half from hell and I truly do feel cursed My father was a very intelligent man making a six figure salary as an engineer He had always had a job whether he was laid off or got a better position I always thought my father was so well put together meticulous and financially savvy I was extremely wrong and now I sit here wondering where did all of the money go My mom was a nurse an amazing one Extremely loved and had the actual heart for being a nurse Unfortunately in 2002 she fell on the ground of the hospital she was working for wet floor and her career abruptly ended at only 42 years old Back surgery slipped disks arm shoulder surgery numerous catscans MRIS two hip replacements a gallbladder removal kidney cancer a few years back and deals with ibs ptsd panic disorder and to be really honest I can t remember a time my mom wasn t in pain after her fall It truly did ruin her entire life and then my dad started taking over financially I was a minor so I wasn t involved I hadn t known about financial issues AT ALL I was under the impression our home was paid off I was also under the impression that my dad was paying his bills the mortage ect He starts acting ODD around 2023 He s acting MANIC depressed agitated lashing out in violence he beat me up from the time I was 16 to around 25 my mom got hit too and frankly it mortifies me but we didn t know where to go or have funds to just LEAVE plus my mom s always sick Times are tough and in 2023 he got a great job but WALKED OFF Lies to us for 4 months Goes out every morning now I wonder WHERE DID HE GO FOR ALL OF THOSE HOURS EVERY DAY He was living a double life essentially Pathological liar and we just found out he forged a signature on a loan against our home We have foreclosure threats we can barely eat and it s all because of this loan he illegally took out and all of his crimes stolen money he took from my mom and I We found out he stopped paying their life insurance we found out he stopped paying our AAA bill when our car tire exploded but they couldn t come out to help because we owed 750 dollars Summer of 2024 he attempted suicide which is a lie We actually have recordings where he admits TO THIS I Would never kill myself I knew exactly what I was doing I didn t think they d commit me I did it I m a white collar criminal you name it I ve done it Literal quote from his last phone call from GREYSTONE So this is my question When someone does finally admit their crime and admit they are suicide attempt was all fake what can you do We have called the police We have told Greystone and these places have PROTECTED AN ABUSER WE CALLED 911 to have him arrested Now he s telling everyone he s crazy so he can escape ANY responsibility My moms health is concerning me everyday I wake up I make sure she s breathing and mentally okay I can t focus on anything but our situation I feel physically ill at only 34 My friends have all truly shown me how much I NEVER meant to them It s extremely hard for people to understand your father being a monster but he is He now calls every single day to torment us Did the water get turned off yet Which actually just happened to us last week I cried I m at my end I m so exhausted I can t think straight I made a go fund me but it truly feels like I m sailing along an empty sea We have this beautiful home but so much work needs to be done we can t sell because we wouldn t even make enough from owing so much my mom s name MUST be taken off these bills This is a crime my mom gave no consent she owns half but we re getting treated like crap Nobody calls us back from any organization we call Lawyers aren t really helpful at all just want a quick buck I can t seem to find anyone that can see this for what it is abuse Financially mentally psychology and psychically I have photos of black eyes cps was here for him as a teen we have documented history of abuse my mom can t walk due to tendons in her foot needing surgery We re down to a number so small it s only 4 digits We have no cell phone service because we cannot afford it We can t afford ANYTHING anymore my mom s front tooth just needed to be replaced so now we really are terrified for our financial disaster I truly thought my father loved me be careful who you consider family Any advice resources would be amazing I have a job but it s not nearly enough we are drowning I would be appreciative of any ideas I live in nj I have every phone call confession evidence I just need people to listen to our story Which is so much sicker and more complex than I can type or convey on here I hope this finds the right people thank you for reading Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers I am extremely afraid and only worry for my momma I truly want to believe in humanity again What father calls their daughter 71 times on her birthday to say having a fun birthday Are you able to pay the

text body: Disclaimer All people within the story are of legal adult age My sister was 18 and just graduated at the time I was 20 and just graduated after being my mother s nurse for 15 years My brother was 31 helping to fix the house and help pay bills My father was years 56 year old at the time and Jane Doe was 54 My mom had a myriad of health issues before passing She had stage 5 kidney failure and was on home dialysis and required me to help her set up her machine at night As well as assist with med distribution My father helped with none of that while she was alive My Sister was just freshly out of high school and just trying to start her life My brother was recovering from a mental breakdown that almost cost him everything before moving back in with us My Father was just a dick Backstory It begins like this Our mom passed away on December 18th 2018 after a long life of health problems So we all knew Christmas this year was gonna be a shit show Fast forward to the second week of January and our family is trying to put together my mom s memorial service We get most of the details worked out and go about life as one does after the loss of a loved one As the weeks flow together we notice that our father is kind of down in the dumps worse than we had seen before This kind of sadness continues for another couple of weeks February rolls around at this point we can all collect ourselves enough to start planning the memorial services We get the details of those set in stone we decide to have a local memorial for our mom shortly after for our church family and friends A few days maybe a week or two after the local memorial service our dad has to go to the bank to settle some accounts and whatnot My siblings and I still reeling from the tragedy that took us all by surprise are at the house when my dad comes home from the bank happier than we had seen him in weeks We were almost worried he had a psychotic break at the bank Now we weren t rich by any means gracefully low middle class So for him to be that happy after such a tragedy plus to have just gotten back from the bank was strange As the little sleuths my siblings and I began to ask him if everything was okay He tells us that he made a friend at the bank that day He tells us that she is a very nice lady and has also just recently lost her husband So as his kids we were like well thank god or whatever higher power was at work that day Because he has a friend to talk to about grief and he won t be so hard to manage Which seems harsh but it was a rough couple of weeks after Mom had passed So my siblings and I are happy for him at this point that he has a local friend to talk to Little did we know that was the worst decision we made He began to talk to her more and hang out with her like maybe one or two times for coffee or food We got through the family memorial we had that March About a week later my father says he would like us to meet this new friend So like the gracious kids we are we agree cause he still seems happy even though our household was in disarray and our financials were a mess As his kids we persevered and agreed to meet with her For the sake of privacy we will call her Jane Doe At this lunch we all seem to get along my siblings and I are a little confused by why we are meeting this friend Jane Doe But we are fine with it about a day or two after meeting her we realize that they are extremely close to each other after just a month after each of their loved ones had passed So we go about life as usual and are asked by our father if we can be nice to Mrs Jane Doe so she knows that we like her Well we think nothing of it at the time and go about life doing our normal things Till my father had her stay over for the first time and well this Jane doe was like a rat you can t get rid of So she begins to stay with us aka just move right in Jane Doe then begins to try and insert herself into mine and my sister s conversations regularly Even starts to give my brother the creeps We went on a trip to visit family and my dad invited her so she could meet my mom s parents During which she made the entirety of my family uncomfortable with the massive amounts of physical displays of affection She then tries to befriend my grandparents who have just lost their oldest daughter After the trip she began to buy us or so it seemed Instead of getting to know us She would just buy us random crap we didn t ask for or want Before my sister and I mostly my sister sit her down and are like hey we don t need all this stuff we need other things like our light bill paid or our water bill paid We don t need any more useless stuff Again we are still being nice at that point My father then pulls me aside and says I need to start being more appreciative and kinder to her So my sister who was genuinely being nice to Jane Doe tries to explain that I am still processing our mom s death and that it s a little hard on me So Jane Doe takes this and thinks she needs to start doing more Well like I said I m an asshole So she continues this behavior of inserting herself in conversations and trying to act like she were a 20 something as a 60 year old So I fully admit I used her for the free stuff because she seemed to be the only one who could get our father to pay the bills somewhat on time So I begin to play like I m her friend One time my dad and Jane Doe went and picked my sister up from work Jane Doe sees a wild animal on her Ring doorbell and decides that my father needs to speed home so she can save her cats They end up getting pulled over and Jane Doe gets out of the car and is screaming and walking towards the officers After not arresting Jane Doe they agreed to let them go with a warning leaving my sister traumatized and bewildered So a little while goes by it is as far from normal as one can be but hey So after a few weeks my dad decides to rewrite his will and it now includes his new friend and her children to get all of his possessions instead of his children Meanwhile my siblings and I are just trying to work to keep the lights on while my dad and Jane Doe are gallivanting around West Virginia and Tennessee every weekend The bills start to pile up my siblings and I are like What do we do So we sit down with our dad and he decides that it s just too much money for him to be going to her house and that she should just move in So she moves in and it only gets worse from there Again it starts awkward and weird but we are adults and it s whatever ever at least the bills are getting paid My sister starts working a different shift that gets her more money and my brother is picking up more shifts for the same thing Well a few weeks go by and sharing a room with my sister with different shifts wasn t the best idea Considering I worked days as a nanny and she worked nights An My father had moved into Jane doe s house at that point Well about a month or two goes by and my father and Jane Doe decided to move back in so they could use her trailer as a Weekend house So I moved out of their old room to the couch in the living room Well Mrs Jane Doe then decides to trape across the house like goddamn elephant at 4 am waking the dogs my siblings and I By turning on every light in the dang house So from there it just seemed to get worse She then started to complain that we were using their bathroom too much granted it was the only working bathroom in the house at that time Then from there it became well that this was her house too just continuous whining to my father So one night while my father and Jane Doe were staying at her house My brother decided to talk with me just to say hey you gotta try and be nicer to her and be more respectful of them keeping the peace So we do it for about a month or two As the holidays approach granted it s our first holiday season without our mother My father says he is having Jane Doe join us and she wants to help My siblings and I are trying to be supportive as this is our first holiday season without our mom to which our father is oblivious He even brings her with us to the grave site Where She just acts like a fool and speaks on things she should not So talk about an awkward Christmas We somehow dredged our way through the holidays making it through December When jane doe decides that it s okay to start changing things around the house She makes the decision to remove everyone of the pictures of our mom and put up pics of her instead Including the most awkward family photo ever my brother wasn t even there and my sister had been cropped out During this time my sister and brother are telling me to be nice be nice blah blah So I begin to be Nice I Begin to hang out with her again and she is none the wiser that all of the compliments are more sarcastic than Bill Hicks on a good day She then finds out from my dad that my mom had a bunch of health issues So she takes it upon herself to bring all of her health problems to me like I m some on call nurse She then uses that as a gateway to try and be like my mother in the most Coraline way possible Being that I m trying to be nice I tell her all the problems are fine and if she is worried go to a professional Even though I m not a licensed professional Well fast forward to the next few days she takes my sister and I on a forced bonding trip Jane Doe tells us that she is not trying to replace our mom and that we don t have to call her mom To which I unthinkingly told her we never thought she was and that unfortunately that s shoes she could never fill Well that seemed to send things into a real bad spiral She tells my father about it and that my sister was some mastermind of evil and that our sister convinced me and my brother to treat her poorly When my sister defends herself she says You think that I would come up with that she just tried to reassure her that she is being nice and she is trying to stop me from being a dick My brother and I both come to her defense and I even after I told her that if I m going out of my way to be nice chances are I m not being nice So for some reason this changes the narrative to now my sister is being rude and that she didn t want Jane Doe in the house and she was the reason we were broke all the time Not the trips every weekend out of state during Covid had anything to do with it or the fact that my literal teenage sister was genuinely being nicer than I ever was But anyway I kept being a dick despite my sisters and brothers best efforts After that whole conversation with Jane Doe I decided my mother s pictures needed to come back out I also needed to up my game if she wasn t going to get a clue So I started to make my comments a little more brutal My brother got the other bathroom working again so we weren t in their space anymore Which also meant that our laundry room was working again Which after a period of not having a washer laundry does pile up Jane Doe took that as a personal attack So she once again complained whined and I kid you not literally cried To my father full temper tantrum style That we were trying to keep her from doing their laundry to make her look bad As well as a way to push her away and not make room for her in our lives So we came up with a laundry schedule that she never could figure out so it was always an issue I mean it wasn t our fault she was incapable of human comprehension right I digress that we were trying our best to get along Well by this point my brother was working so much that his mental health was deteriorating My sister was too stressed with school and work On top of being worried about what Jane Doe would say next to try and get her kicked out So I ll admit that I used Jane Doe s deep pockets to fuel my Bad habits Meanwhile nobody is worrying about the bills Once again as it always does bills became due and my dad would take it personally and lash out by screaming slamming all the things he could While putting the blame on my sister and I cause we haven t been helping enough or making Jane feel welcomed So he just all together stops paying altogether and just does what he wants with Jane Doe and leaves us to our own devices They for all sense of the meaning moved out and I can t stress that enough We think this is the best thing to have happened in years Well we get the bills straightened out and we get all the stuff almost to a good level I mean no money for groceries but hey rice and chicken broth never gets old My siblings and I handle all the bills as best we can and try to keep food on the table while taking care of my dads dog that my dad had just left behind My sister finally got to go to school Things were looking up Well all good things must come to an end right Once again Jane Doe and our dad move back in and make her house their weekend house Well of course shit hits the fan once again and my siblings and I are left with a deadline of we have to be moved out by September that year So we start to freak out wondering What are we going to do So we all go about our lives figuring it out All the while trying to dodge my father and Jane Doe within the house We get ourselves together and Jane Doe just still isn t satisfied for some unknown reason and decides to try and be mine and my sister s friend again while treating us like crap We have to be nice and during this time Jane Doe decides to lose all sense of the meaning of boundaries and decides to walk into mine and my sisters room repeatedly unclothed throughout the months of us getting our stuff together to move out She would also walk around complaining that her house is a mess All of us were still trying to keep the lights on in the house and keep what little peace we all had left Like clockwork work Jane doe starts up again and brings my father into it more now It also mostly seemed geared toward my sister for some unknown reason now Jane Doe tries to be our Friend again Shortly after with the same stuff different label all over again We all get out of the twilight zone and begin furthering our lives Until about a two years later our father tried to contact us and be all buddy buddy again Asking why we don t ever answer Jane Doe or why we never contact them There are more stories than the ones I highlighted here these were just the basic rundown of what happened What are peoples thoughts on it",20,,sibling

text body: Small context I ve F 28 moved recently to the US in late November 2023 to be with my husband M 33 I lived in Malaysia by myself before this I haven t stayed with family since I graduated high school they were pretty toxic and abusive so I keep a distance which also means I might not be used to a different kind of family dynamic My husband has lived in the US all his life At 23 he started paying mortgage on a house This is the house we re me husband brother in law currently living in His other family members would live here on and off brothers in laws and mother but it s still my husband s house despite sometimes it feels like our house is open to them 24 7 another story for another day We re living with my husband s older brother 43 and he should be moving out by the end of the month However he has some habits that make me uncomfortable and I m no longer sure what the right course of action is anymore He walks around in his underwear doesn t clean up after himself nor does his chores He used to sleep on the couch despite having agreed to only sleep in his room once I moved in He s stopped now but we still catch it sometimes and my husband will tell him to go sleep upstairs I m the one who cleans after him most of the time My husband helps out but it s still 80 cleaned by me Honestly I ve been crashing in and out about this mentally being a newly legal immigrant in 2025 in a red state all this at home previous trauma but I m holding onto the hope that he s moving out by the start of next month I can t legally find a job nor can I drive so I m stuck at home 24 7 with my cats and while a part of me wants to show him his actions has consequences I need to make sure the floor is clean and like in case the cats are out and about they won t accidentally eat something or topple anything We ve asked him to help out with chores I asked him to please put on some clothes when I m around I was raised Muslim in Malaysia men who aren t family don t walk around topless in front of a woman and to also ensure his stuff for his aquarium isn t accessible to the cats but he just DOESN T CARE The smallest thing of please making sure his bedroom door and the toilet door upstairs is closed we don t use our upstairs rooms for anything but cats will be cats yknow and he still can t do it He told us he forgets sometimes so I started placing post it notes on his door but he still somehow forgot 3 times in the span of 10 days My cats like playing fetch and they ve been fetching his algae and some other things for his aquarium and despite telling him to put it somewhere else he doesn t so my husband and I clean his mess He has also once flooded our closet and kitchen floor after falling asleep filling up his water tank for his aquarium and we had to clean up most of the mess He half assed it and didn t even say sorry He used to pay rent stopped for almost a year until I told my husband that isn t fair and he should be paying for something Now he pays rent at a discount and my husband was kind enough imo a bit too kind to absolve some of his loans too My husband and him BIL had a sit down talk where he was told to help with the chores and that he needs to start paying rent In that conversation BIL agreed to pay for rent stop sleeping in the living room and move out eventually He did say that since I m unemployed I should be cleaning the house and that he sees my husband cleaning up and cooking When my husband cleans and cooks 90 it s just helping me out Especially cooking cause he thinks only a wife should cook apparently Like my husband and I s cooking process goes I sous chef he cooks it sometimes I still cook for my husband and my husband helps out cleaning the dishes or with prep We both have zero complains about our mechanic Before I came my husband already said he doesn t want me to think I have to cook and clean for him he just wants me to feel safe and relaxed while going through immigrating and making a new life in the US I do all this because I love my husband and like it feels kinda nice to RP as a housewife for now but like I m doing it for my husband and not for his family He then continued to say that my husband spoils me too much and my husband said that she spoils me so I give back so that was that Now however I think he s taking a piss at me tbh His habits hasn t changed he still walks around in his undies I still clean his mess up and we still need to remind him constantly to do chores Is this normal in other Asian households or is this some bullshit How do we fix this Cause I m ngl I m very angry at this situation and I don t want to erupt but my patience is running thin We ve tried talking to him multiple times we tried cleaning up and being patient and we ve tried post it notes I feel like it s inappropriate for me to call him out cause I m his brother s wife and my husband has tried to put his foot down by telling him to move out but it s still a little intimidating for him cause he s his older brother and in Asian families it s out of the norm to talk back to your elders I would love advice I am also okay with talking to him and confronting him instead of my husband cause at this point I hate him He is really taking advantage of my husband s kindness and I hate feeling like a maid in my own house and not feeling comfortable because there is a man in his underwear outside my door that I ve only known for 6 months EDIT TLDR Husband s 33M older brother 43 who lives with us won t do chores or anything much to help out with the house but still makes a mess Tried talking to him and putting post it notes to remind him but nothing works He s moving out within a month but would like to see if there s any way to make his transition smoother aka not me being his maid",28,Female,Wife

text body: Well my where the hell do i start I guess my trauma and mental illness stems a great deal from my mother She is a toxic energy sucking vampire who will destroy anyone she deems to be below her and in her own eyes it s her daughter me Growing up I thought I was an angry child It turns out I m not I m very kind and thoughtful I was just in a family who didn t value or respect me as a person with their own individual wants or needs Growing up I exhibited normal emotional reactions to things and I was always dismissed and told I m faking it for attention I m manipulative selfish all of these words and thoughts stemmed from my narccisitc mother and she instilled them upon my brother and father who both treated me as she treated me Needless to say I became the black sheep of the family my brother the golden child who could do no wrong I never even got into trouble Growing up I didn t have alot of friends because of my parents so i was doomed to spend my time in our cramped little trailer hearing them fight or they would fight with me I was always name called from a young age I was stupid useless good for nothing I could never do anything right in their eyes I don t know why they hated me so much I never stole the baddest thing I did as a kid was drink but who didn t I was just always given a hard time I dealt with alot of depression and suicide thoughts growing up I used to cut myself I remember showing my mother my cuts and she told me i was a lunatic and to never tell anyone or I m going to a mental hospital No love or support there the basis of my life with my parents particularly my mother No love So I buried alot of my mental health issues and they festered I was always so sad and angry living at home being bullied by my parents and limited help I was a loser growing up I didn t have nice clothes I was over weight always alone in my house with my crazy parents Needless to say when I met my first boyfriend at 19 I was over the moon to rush into that relationship and move out Turns out the hero I thought i was running too ended up physically and mentally abusing me for 4 years My parents knew about the abuse they seen the bruises and no one protected me I felt trapped like I couldn t leave the relationship It was either stay with him and grt abused or go live with my parents and get abused I wanted neither Eventually I left my ex and I was able to live on my own with my daughter But my parents are still involved in my life They don t help they only shoot off and bring me down I feel hurt and misunderstood by them that I never got the love and support I needed and deserved growing up or after my abusive relationship My mother told my ex before she knew how I could be so she understood fucked right to say that to a man you know is hitting your daughter I m 31 years old I m tired of letting them have control over my emotions A part of me still wants a relationship with them but I know it won t happen they are mean and toxic and fail to see their faults Even now I m doing better in life I quit drinking and I m going back to school for nursing and they still are making me out to be a bad person to fit their narrative It just hurts when your biggest enemy is your parents they are the ones who are supposed to love and support you the most in this life",31,Female,daughter

author: Own_Awareness466
text body: I m a 20 years old guy Currently living with my parents and one brother but being honest I don t know how longer I can take this situation My relationship with them was always complicated My dad s a good person but he was an alcoholic for a long time stopped drinking 5 or 6 years ago after almost dying from an accident cause by himself while drunk and he s the kind of person who just treats you very well if you re the exact way he wants so if you do anything different from what he think is good you re a bad person a bad son and you should reflect about your actions I moved with them to do college the graduation I wanted was during daytime so he started pressing me to do it in the night time because I NEEDED to get a job no matter what he said that he would not die working just to pay the bills alone basically good to clarify that I don t have a job but I work informally sometimes and always help them with the little money I receive So I ended up doing it some weeks after that he started trying to convince me to give up college for now because the place where we live now is dangerous at night I refused because he was the one pressing me for doing it at night and he started saying that I was selfish and never understood them There are a lot of different problems in our relationship but this post will be too long so I m not going to dive that deep My mom Well she s unstable The kind that loves you unconditionally and could die for you but also the kind of person that almost killed me in a rage burst she had she literally strangled me more times than I can remember she also did this to my brothers in other situations She pointed knives at me when I was a kid for very dumb things I did and there s a lot of other dysfunctional behaviors she had through time Like she s used to act like crazy for nothing and after starts crying as she just realizes what she did after it happened it s really crazy to watch this kind of thing And since she started to suspect I m gay I m bissexual but never came out for them for obvious reasons she started to treat me in a bad way Everytime I hang out with some friends when I came home she was always complaining and acting as I was doing something bad she even said that I was a shame once because she thought that I was dating a friend of mine by this time She told me I looked like a beggar once I have afro hair and wanted to use it without styling sometimes and there s a lot of other things here too but for the same reason as the last paragraph I m not going to extend this So I think you guys can bet my childhood and life in general was never very chill inside home My parents did what they could to raise 3 kids while being poor as fuck and I know they re not bad people because they always tried to give us the best But it was always a rollercoaster Everyday thinking if my mom was going to go crazy by something that I did or if my dad was going to come home drunk again and they would fight screaming like crazy It s stressful as a kid not to know if you re safe in your own home As I grew old I realized how dysfunctional this was and that it caused me a lot of problems besides worsening the problems I already had It leads to the situation that made me write this Some days ago I was arguing with my dad I can t remember the subject but we were both very stressed out My mom was not part of that talk but she was looking at me with an ugly face the whole time Then suddenly she gets up the couch and attacked me She grabbed me by my hair and threw me in the ground and then started to beat me The house was a mix of screams and cursing words She yelled I was a disrespectful son of a bitch and other things One day after that I decided to go to my sister s house she lives in another state because I was tired of that situation The days were chill I have a good relationship with her even when we have a problem we always try to solve it talking and usually it works well I came back to start college going to start it tomorrow by the way but I haven t spoke to my mom since I got here again I don t want to she didn t even apologize to me for what she did actually she never apologize when she goes crazy like that but my dad come to me and said I shouldn t act like she s my enemy and he doesn t want anyone in his house acting like this because I don t live here alone so I can t ignore them The thing is it came to the point where I just came back home because of my graduation I don t want to suffer anymore because of how they act they re old now and don t want to change no matter how many times I try to talk about how their behavior isn t healthy At the same I feel guilty because of what my dad said to me I don t want to talk with her but I don t want to be seem as the villain here Am I right if I just continue to live without talking to them Or am I just being childish like he said TLDR I want to stop talking to my parents but I live with them and I don t know

text body: I want to share something that s been weighing heavily on me In my family it s me my mom dad two sisters my brother his wife and their two kids We all absolutely adore those kids We shower them with love care and attention My mom their grandmother especially goes out of her way to cook their favorite meals and care for them like her own The bond we all share with those children is strong and full of love But the problem is their mother my brother s wife Every morning she yells at them Sometimes she even hits them just because they aren t getting ready fast enough These kids are only 10 years old It s heartbreaking to see them go through that She s always scolding them either about their studies or just to make them get ready The kids clearly prefer the food my mom makes over their mother s and they feel safer with her But their mom often acts in ways that are harsh and emotionally damaging especially for kids their age It s not healthy and it s definitely not right What hurts even more is her history After having these kids she was caught cheating on my brother not once but twice And yet my mom forgave her Why Because of the kids She worried about who would take care of them if things fell apart But this woman has never respected our home From the beginning she s fought with my mom created constant tension and now she s even started dividing our house She removed all our things from the upper floor and somehow managed to convince my brother that we are the problem That we are the ones who don t want her to live here What s more confusing is how blindly my brother trusts her despite everything Even after catching her cheating twice Even now I ve heard from reliable sources that she might still be in touch with another man I don t know if it s true but it wouldn t surprise me When I try to speak up when I try to stand up for my mom or the kids my own father shuts me down He yells at me like I m the one tearing the family apart It breaks me We used to be such a close happy family My siblings and I shared a strong bond even after my brother s marriage for a while But ever since she came into our lives everything s been falling apart She s done things I never imagined someone could do to their own family And the worst part All this drama is draining me emotionally just when something great is coming up in my career I should be focusing and preparing but my mind is trapped in this chaos I m not someone who stays quiet If the threat were from outside I d fight without hesitation But when it s your own family tearing itself apart how do you fight that How do you protect what s left without hurting the ones you love",,,

text body: So for some background I graduated last year with a Pharmacy degree Where I am from I have to train for a year then sit an exam in order to be a registered pharmacist I moved back home after living away for university 5 years and started my training year here with my exam being 1 month away The company I work for offer study conferences 4 times a year where they teach us content skills and examine us which has been great so far Since we re at the end of the training our final conference is tomorrow in a city about 1 5 hours away from me and it s 4 days which has been fully expensed by the company and since I m getting paid it is mandatory attendance I hope to work as a relief pharmacist which means going to pharmacies where they need cover which means I will have to drive to places that may be a fair distance away I thought if I drove to this conference it will be great way to build up my motorway confidence as I have only driven on motorways for a short distance My mom randomly mentioned wanting to come with me to get away I said she can come with me but she will have to get the train back as I plan on driving I didn t expect her to stay over as we are not allowed guests and also 4 days away from home when I ll be working full time won t be fun for her She said it s fine she will drive me and stay with me and I honestly lost it I have been extra stressed for my exam and also i do not get along with my mother I can t study at home I am always in the library after work and on weekends this is mainly due to my mother distracting me with her BS when I try and study from home The last thing I would want is to have her stay in my room and disrupt 1 My study plans I was extra excited to have a stress free work space and a room to myself 2 My sleep pattern she sleeps super late and always has her phone on max volume 3 The last time I will spend with my colleagues as I am not staying within my company 4 Building my driving confidence and she wants to drive me 5 Just my peace as I was looking forward to getting away from this toxic bubble and just enjoying my own space 6 I actually took switched my Friday shift for a Saturday as I wanted to spend an extra night away from home She took my reaction as suspicious and is now forcing me to either call in sick or that she will drive me and stay with me and want evidence of my timetable She has the right to be suspicious because I didn t let them know I plan an extra night to myself there but I didn t think it is necessary to mention due to the nature of my parents I just genuinely feel embarrassed and on edge that I m going to be sharing a room with her and also my company might intervene as we are not allowed additional guests I m going insane and i genuinely don t know what to do TL DR my mom is staying with me during a work trip because she doesn t trust me",25,Female,daughter

text body: Just trying to understand my sister and how she reacts to things Example Scenario My sister is driving my mom is in the passenger seat and my nephew and I in the back seat We re coming back from a nice Mother s Day outing at a nursery yesterday We suddenly come up on stopped traffic small suburban two lane road and my sister has to slam on the brakes I think partly b c of traffic I think partly b c she tends to be a fast ish driver and was all animated and into a story she was telling Next thing I know she s pulled to the side of the road and starts screaming at our mother about how Mom s reaction to the suddenly stopped traffic wasn t safe Context Mom was in a traumatic car accident last fall with her husband who was driving had a medical incident passed out and the car accelerated down a neighborhood street before crashing into the side of a house all while my mom watched this in real time from the passenger seat Airbags deployed bricks from a chimney fell on to the car and Mom didn t know if she or her husband were going to die in the next second She s not had any triggering episodes regarding driving since then until this experience with my sister this weekend Also two weeks ago her husband our stepdad died suddenly so we re all trying to deal with that grief My sister picks up on the fact that Mom is likely triggered by what just happened but instead of pulling off to the side and taking a minute she flys off the handle basically yells at mom I know you re probably triggered right now by what just happened but you can t scream like that when I m driving because it could cause an accident I absolutely did not hear mom scream but I suspect mom did make her typical panic sudden AH and gets jumpy when traffic stops suddenly this is a common thing My mother starts sobbing and cowering in her seat for the next 45 minutes as my sister gets on the highway and proceeds to drive nearly 80mph home she s clearly upset stressed herself and in typical sister fashion road rages We also nearly get into ANOTHER accident on the highway because someone started to come into our lane on the right without seeing us and my sister was trapped b c of a truck on our left thus adding even more tension to the environment Sister pulls over and continues to rage at us before speeding home again my sister makes it very clear she s upset because while she understands mom was likely triggered by the traffic situations she feels like she was being judged for her driving like she s been judged and dismissed for everything else she does in her life she said It was like whoa WTF dude let s take a step back this is NOT about you I did not say that though as I m frankly scared to death of my sister and when she s in this OMG THE WORLD HATES ME mode you can t say anything to her and expect her to react reasonably she ll just come back even more angry it s usually best just to walk away even if it angers her even more something my therapist has taught me recently you can t be responsible for someone else s feelings Part of me feels she is just constantly wanting to feel validated and seen but it s hard to do that on my end when there is wall of rage there When we got back to my sister s apartment mom quietly asked that my sister listen to her to please not yell and just listen Mom explained in further detail while sobbing and shaking how traumatic the car accident was and how my sister s driving is incredibly scary when going 80mph on a highway where the limit is 65 and my sister needs to understand all this Well hell froze over because my sister APOLOGIZED she never does that but later when I m trying to assess if we should leave we live two hours south of my sister or try to salvage the day I talk with my sister about if she wants to go to dinner with us and she says sure I ll put on my fake smile and be nice like I have my entire life with my family even though I m always judged for what I do and how I do things and I ll never be good enough JFC Sure I ve probably judged her for her actions and reactions to things I don t understand who doesn t but as I ve learned recently more about her ADHD recently it s explained a lot about her and her decisions and how she approaches things in life and I can better understand how to interact with her but still doesn t explain the flying off the handle and rage that our entire family has to endure from her Like we re scared to say anything sometimes and walk on eggshells around her b c we have no idea is she s going to explode or be chill even something as simple as making a suggestion or offering to help with something After this Mother s Day incident aside from wanting to completely cut my sister off my from mom and I to protect ourselves I d kid nap my nephew too if I could I just wonder what else is going on For context I do get that she has a LOT going on too she s a single mom working in the legal field has a young teen son an asswipe of an ex husband and drinks WAY too much it s like a switch flips in her after a couple I refuse to pick up the phone when she calls late at night But after this incident part of me has suddenly thought maybe there is something else going on like bi polar going on b c her mood swings can be so wild My poor nephew has to endure this daily he has no idea what kind of mood his mother is going to be in when she gets home maybe this was more of a rant or vent or unloading but also anyone dealt what siblings who they walk on eggshells around TL DR we walk on eggshells around my sister and we re tired off

Josie After some back and forth we ended up going on a date Now as much as I despise her now I can admit that I was absolutely smitten by her at the time So much so that looking back now I looked passed and ignored so many red flags but hey I was a naive 20 year old who really liked a girl and more importantly I had certain non negotiable principles that ended up being my own undoing Some back story for Josie when I knew her at school at 14 15 years old she was relatively quiet Not one of the popular kids but not exactly bottom of the pile nerds either We never interacted much apart from a few jokes and balls of paper thrown at her in class but no one ever had any issues with her When we first got together she had told me a lot about her ex boyfriends who all ended up being abusive Particularly her last one who had been both physically mentally and emotionally abusive to her As a kid who grew up in foster car and kids homes due to abuse I received as a child I was very sympathetic but it also hilighted to me that I wanted to make her feel safe given our shared experience despite it s differences The first ignored warning It s important to note that this was within the first few weeks My band played an acoustic gig at a city centre night club to support a then big band called The View famous for their hit single Same Jeans right in the middle of the whole British indie phase My band mates invited some of their friends to come and watch and I invited Josie We played our set which went well and enjoyed the rest of the night When we got back to my place she asked why I kept looking at one of my band mates friends whilst I was on stage She said while we was playing she overheard her and her friend talking about me and that she thought I was attractive and that I kept on looking at her while I was playing I explained that I wasn t looking at anything whilst onstage apart from either my guitar or my band mates because when you look out to the audance all you can see is silloettes due to the lights pointing at us Josie turned into a different person altogether she went from arguing to screaming to insulting to breaking the relationship off altogether This is where STUPID young 20 year old me really messed up I really liked this girl so I the chivalrous night fought to calm her down and fight for our new relationship until eventually me and Josie were back on She apologised for how she acted she shed some tears and I comforted her and reassured her Little did I know that this would become a pattern in our relationship About a month in I received a text from Josie saying I don t think we should be together At first she wouldn t tell me why but after about an hour s worth of back and forth and me almost begging her to tell me what s wrong she eventually tells me that she has depression and is bipolar It turns out she s always had depression which was brought on by the abuse she received in previous relationships her Dad abandoning her and the abuse she received from her Mum She told me that her Mum had her sectioned in her teens This resulted in low moods and suicidal tendencies 20 year old me in 2010 hasn t got a clue what any of that means so I head to Google and look up depression Low moods lack of motivation and so on but hey I m a chivalrous night remember so it s my job stand by someone when things get hard when they need love and support and to not judge So I go ahead and tell her that it doesn t matter to me and in my own time proceed to look up how to support or help someone with depression I look back now and I was so nieve so immature but I had an idea of how a man should be and I really wanted to do right by her Little did I know that this would be used in EVERY argument moving forward After some time we decided to move in together We got a flat had it all decorated and furnished and hoped to begin our new life This is where things gradually escalated Josie had a temper over the smallest things There would be a huge fight she would say she warned me or told me what she was like and that we shouldn t be together I would try to calm her down and talk She would cry and apologise blame her depression and I would always tell her tomorrow is a new day These episodes escalated more with more shouting more aggression until eventually one arguement she hit me I will never forget it I was so shocked hurt and confused I didn t really know what to do We lived in a high rise flat next to a dual carriageway way that comes off the motorway leading in and out of the city She was threatening to kill herself by running into traffic so I wouldn t let her out of the flat So he pulled a knife out of the drawer and I had to prize it off of her and hide the knives so she started climbing out of the window so I pulled her down and locked it She hit me again Unfortunately Google did not qualify me to deal with this so I called the police The police came to our flat I told them what happened she told them that I was keeping her prisoner in the flat but I explained that she was threatening to kill herself and showed them the hidden knives that I had taken off her They asked me if I wanted to press charges and I said no I hoped that this would be enough to scare her in to not hitting me again Guess what she warned me and told me we shouldn t be together Why did she act like this It was because of her depression which she warned me about she cried she apologised I told her tomorrow is a new day I understand but you don t need to worry because I won t abandoned you I can t even tell you the amount of times that I had to lock windows pull knives off of her take away bleach take away tablets and pull her out of roads before repeating the the whole explanation and forgiveness to reassurance process again until it just became normal Arguments because more personal using any insecurities to insult me Skinny little rat was a favourite of hers given my insecurity about my weight at the time She would threaten to get her male friends to pick her up Run to her family tell them her side of the story which was mostly lies until her family pretty much hated me even after we made up She carried on hitting me progressed to throwing things at me and began using my own affection towards her against me Before you judge me on the next bit I want you to remember that I was young and I really did love her a lot Her lack of self control due to depression made it so that this wasn t her fault and leaving her didn t even cross my mind because what kind of man abandons some one who is ill We decided to have a baby together During the the pregnancy things got worse She started hitting me more often and now this unborn child became a new and effective weapon against me She would threaten to run away with the baby threaten to make sure I ll never see the baby ect As mentioned before I grew up in care It s a complicated back story but I was beaten and abused as a child went into foster homes was adopted then ended up back in foster homes to ending up in a kids home until ending up in my own flat at 16 where at some point I reconnected with my adopted parents I had experienced a lot of abuse a lack of stability but I knew if and when I ever became a Dad I would do every thing I could to be the best I could be And in 2012 my dream came true and we had a beautiful daughter We moved in to a house and my parents paid for some of Josie s car lessons and tests so we could manage easier Just writing things as I go trying to remember things back in the 2010 s onwards going out clubbing and drinking was a big thing and Josie was out around once a week drinking Short skirts high heels and lots of alcohol I don t drink so didn t go out with her plus she was with her own friends which would have been weird Bit it did get to a point where I felt she was living a single girl life As you can tell we argued a lot and she would go out drinking with her friends and whilst out she would post photos on Facebook of her posing and poutong next to random men After the birth of our daughter this didn t slow down If I m honest when with our daughter this didn t really affect her parenting She was naturally really good with babies having lots of nieces and nephews and I like to think that our baby was oblivious to most things although that probably wasn t the case This changed a year later when we unexpectedly had another daughter As our first grew older she was quite clearly a Daddy s girl This meant that our second daughter was glued to Josie s hip all of the time She didn t like anyone apart from Josie Grandparents friends aunties cousins and sometimes even me And Josie made sure of that This began to change as time went on as whilst I was really poor with babies toddlers and kids I was really good with Josie began to build a resentment towards both of the children but mainly our eldest who was still very clearly a daddies girl She would shout and swear at them during her episodes and threaten to hit them But of course during episodes with me she would threaten to run away with them tell them lies about me The children were an effective tool to control me There were numerous occasions where we were all in the car Josie would speed up dangoursly and threaten to drive us all into a wall or a tree which terrifying My life hadn t quite gone how I expected at this point I had a lack of job stability working in sales where at one point I was working 16 hours a day shifts at a call centre I was struggling financially as Josie would take credit out in my name for catalogues and left lots of bills unpaid in my name to fund her night life clubbing and drinking I was underweight being 5 foot 10 and 60 Kilograms around 130 pounds I was hiding the fact that the woman I loved was hitting me insulting me due to the shame and humiliation I no longer spoke to my friends as if I made plans she would be fine with it then start an argument on that day until I didn t go out and then people stopped inviting me out I hated my self my body and my life but at the time I blamed myself and my ability to provide for the the family so I decided to talk to Josie about doing something that I d always wanted to do to get her thoughts on it After a long conversation I decided to join the British Army at 26 years old Not a desicion to take lightly but I wanted financial stability for Josie and our children and I wanted to do it with her blessing to make sure that we were as team in this desicion After competition all tests and assessments the time came to begin basic training so we got to the train station and Josie and my daughters waved me off crying Let me tell you that basic training was almost hell for me and it had nothing to do with the Army Texts started off as supportive to asking for more money to finding out rent was not being paid to asking for all my wages Then to telling me she wasn t happy and wanting to be single then to loving me then to asking me if I was ok with her doing fetish photoshoots to then bring told I m controlling when I didn t like it to then everything being ok Until I received a text from one of her sisters that Josie was on a date with another man I frantically called Josie repeatedly who did not pick up Her sister told me that they had been dating for a while and he was sleeping at my house which Josie eventually denied until she couldn t When I found this out it felt like somebody had yanked my heart out of my chest I look back and pity me back then but despite everything I had gone through I really did love her and I really tried my best to be the man I wanted to be I may not have got it right all the time but I really wanted to do right by her As usual Josie turned nasty she insulted me threatened that I d never see my daughter s threatened to kill them on multiple occasions and emptied my bank account This was the point where I decided I d had enough I contacted my bank for all the unauthorised uses some of which paid for family days out with Josie my daughter s and this new guy thats right the guy that was sleeping with my fiancé in my bed was taking my family out using my money I called social services as Josie was threatening to kill our daughters And I called the police and reported all of the abuse I had received over the years Josie begged for us to stay together for a long time She would not stop begging and she pulled out every trick imaginable sympathy empty promises victimhood depression suicide you name it Eventually my anger subsided and was replaced with sympathy which lead to me cancelling my fraud claim with the bank and cancelling my report to the police something I regret to this day She began telling me about this guy she was seeing telling me they argued because she found a bag of cocaine in his bag and that he was abusive ect Eventually I finished 3 months of basic training and went on to more training which was 5 months in barracks located near my hometown we were heading towards a somewhat amicable break up until one day Me and a female colleague had finished a training module and the cook house was closed so I drove us to KFC to get tea Josie must have seen us eating in the car and before I knew it my car door had been swung open and Josie who was with her sister was screaming and swearing at me and my colleague She hit me scratched me and took my car keys until I called the police I told them everything that happened but Josie told the police that I hit her Any hope of an amicable break up was lost at that point Josie carried on seeing this new man and he quikly moved in with her and my daughters which I wasnt happy about given they had been together barely two months but there was nothing I could do Until I got a call from the police saying my daughters had been involved in a domestic incident It was reported that the new guy had got into a physical altercation with Josie Infront of the children and they were reopening a case for the children with social services They deemed that the new guy was a danger to the children and that there was not to be anywhere near them A master manipulator after some time social services reported no concerns the police never seemed to take me or my concerns seriously and Josie seemed quite content in lying to authorities and spreading lies about me to friends and family but as far as I was concerned I was done All I cared about was makeing sure I was doing everything I could as a dad for my daughters who were now my one and only priority After some time things calmed down and me and Josie had a long discussion We talked about everything thet had happened in our relationship during the break up and how nasty things has got Baring mind this was 8 years ago but I still remember a lot of this conversation I remember saying I don t get things right all the time but I really do think I m a good man and I only ever meant right by you she just said I know We talked about some of the things she had done like threatening to kill us all Shouting and swearing at the kids introducing them to a new man whilst we re still engaged behind my back she cried saying I m a shit mum and I tried to comfort her We eventually agreed that our daughters might have a better chance with me as the primary carer until she can deal with whatever mental issues We spoke to social sevices and completed some paperwork to get the ball rolling Things were looking like they would start to work themselves out until I received a phone call informing me that the new guy is still in a relationship with Josie and is now spending time with our daughters again This is where I had to make one of the hardest decisions I ve ever had to make If I report it Josie will kick off and stop the whole process of making me our daughters primary carer but at least the authories know and I can guarantee our daughter s safety Or don t report it keep Josie sweet can continue to the process of becoming out daughters primary carer but this means putting our daughters in danger I need them with me I need to make sure that they re being looked after properly but what if I say nothing and something happens to them I only had one choice I couldn t not risk my own daughter s safety so I had no choice but to report it Bit I know what the conciquences would be Sure enough I received a phone call and hour later from Josie Did you fucking report me to social services Don t think you re getting them girls I ll make sure you don t fucking see them Turns out to cover her tracks she introduced the same man to our daughters under another name to trick them into thinking it was someone else to avoid scrutiny from social services Then she blamed me Then she said that it wasn t him that abused her but it was her abusing him Then during the court process CAFCSSS who are scum pulled police records were Josie was reported to be involved in 8 physical domestic desputes not including the reports I made so she was never a victim of her ex like she told me when we first got together but it was the other way round We ended up going to court where we agreed share cared custody So much has been missed out but anyway this brings us to 2020 Things have been shaky but it s the best of a bad situation I m seeing our daughters regularly but not nearly as much as I d like but they are pretty much the only thing that kept me going I m in a relationship with Josie s complete opposite a kind hearted caring and just an amazing woman who my daughters have taken to really well And this is where my once estranged adopted parents come in A bit of back story with them for ease I ll refer to them as mum and dad but they in no way deserve this title During my time with them as a child Dad was what I considered a good example of a family man Worked really hard for the family Didn t have too much to say but when he did you listened could work on and fix anything Mum had a loving side but was constantly nagging shouting and very strict If you were on her bad side She would be really spiteful Dad had two daughters already and remarried to my mum Mum adopted me and my brother and then later on adopted a girl who we considered our sister All in all I had 3 sisters and one brother From what I gather my dad and his ex fought in court until my dad resfused to be emotionally and financially blackmailed and decided to hope that his daughters our step sisters come and find me when they were older so we no longer saw them My adopted sister had enough of mum and dad and decided to go back in to care when she was 14 or 15 My little brother had had enough decided to go back into care when he was 9 or 10 and finally I had had enough and I decided to go back into care when I was 13 Mum was overbaring manipulative and at times plain mean However at around 17 we reconnected talked about the past and moved on Now as much as I hate them now I can t lie whilst I was with Josie They didn t know anything about what was happing to me in terms of the abuse and when things got unmanageable financially they bailed me out Mum would often try to meditate and they were generally much more chilled out and supportive than when I was a kid I made a lot of effort with them and undoubtedly they made alot of effort with me But things changed when I deployed to the Falkland Islands for 6 months I had been in my new relationship for some time now and I could tell my mum wasn t keen but it was manageable but my parents absolutely could not stand Josie We realised however that my mum had to keep up the mediator friend role with Josie so that we could make sure that our daughters where either sort me or my parents rather than Josie so we could take advantage of the fact that Josie would take any opportunity to get rid of the kids That way we knew they were being looked after and brought up properly Before leaving for the Falklands me my girlfriend and my parents agreed that they have them as much as Josie aloud to make sure they re looked after properly Whiled deployed tensions were growing between my girlfriend and mum Mum would message saying my girlfriend made no effort with them I d bring it up and then my girlfriend would send screenshot messages of her inviting my mum to do things and getting ignored This sort of thing started causeing a small rift between us but manageable and easily repaired COVID hit which made everything worse but Josie barely had our daughters throughout most of it so I was content When I came home after 6 months Everything seemed Mum seemed off She was dictating contact with my daughter s between everyone one and I began to get frustrated so I called a family meeting to try and solve it We all addressed our concerns mum admitted that she has become really attatched to the girls and admitted she had stepped over the like and articulated why which was understandable At the time things seemed more or less resolved Some time later I was on a two week deployment and received a phonecall from mum about having the kids at some particular dates However this was during a period I was home for leave so I said no but I m deploying for two weeks here so you can have them then but when I m home I need to spend time with them Mum got very agressive shouted and hung up I called Josie straight after and asked her when it comes to seeing the girls as we are the parents can we organise dates please as my mum is trying to dictate everything you know what she s like Jodie laughed and said ye that s fine I get another call from mum kicking off so I hung up and carried on with work I arrive back from deployment and I m lifting my bags from the back of an SV and my phone vibrates as a message has come through from Josie She says that I m no longer aloud to see the children that I have abused them and that they re not safe around me or my girlfriend My head was spinning with shock confusion and panic I let my mum know straight away who seemed just as shocked so I start making some phone calls to social services turn out Josie called raising concerns after being informed by grandmother my mum of I ll treatment from me to the children So call my parents to my house and confront them They she admits it than starts saying how I treat the children is wrong and that I ve changed since coming back from the Falklands I said this is because of the family meeting you wanting to dictate who does what and nothing to do with how I parent I also onto remind them of thier parenting when we was kids which resulted in all of us choosing to go back into the care system Spitting on us when we were naughty banging our skulls together when arguing or developing a stutter because I was scared of saying three wrong thing The conversation went nowhere and she just said I think it s best we don t see each other again and that was that This time I was preparing I downloaded every text of Josie s abuse sound recordings of her abuse and violence photos of marks she left on me every catalogue bill and debt she hadn t paid that got left to me because I was the only one working pictures of my credit score at 200 points to 750 points in 5 years as she no longer has access to my accounts letters from the girls to me and my now fiance pictures Every accusation had a rebuttal with proof I used the freedom of information act to request all social services records medical records police records and school records These raised 18 occasions where an authority pointed out Josie had been dishonest multiple occasions where she has put our daughters in danger records that shoe Josie had been mentally physically and emotionally abusive to at least 3 men had been violent to her own family members Character witnesses whiteness statements from Josie s own family I wanted the truth finally out there Spent hundreds on stationary and hundreds of hours reading every available document with a fine comb A rather clever move from Josie was tell child maintenance that I hadn t paid anything which put me in a nice chunk of debt Stupid me set up child maintenance to stop Josie from trying to extort more money from me Then all of Josie s debts came through like unpaid rent catalogues and unpaid council tax so we agreed I ll pay the debts and when that s paid I ll carry on paying you All of her debts were paid off told child maintance she hadn t received a penny from me now I get to pay it all over again straight from my wages We had CAFCASS meetings where I presented everything They wouldn t even look at it we had pre hearings where I was questioned like a criminal we spoke to CAFCASS again explained what was in the folder we sent them Proof of everything I ve been saying Not he said she said black and white official documents proving I ve been telling the truth the whole time CAFCASS go on to write a section 7 that I received in the mail which contains their reccomendations to the courts I read it and just burst in to tears I just couldn t understand how or why I sat there thinking of ways to kill myself should I leave a note What would I say I called Samaritans didn t know what to say how to start could barely speak He tried to help Just a volunteer But he was just irritating me of course I looked at this legal thing of course I have evidence USELESS But it wasn t his fault I just hung up I eventually went home from work Christmas was approaching we still need to buy this and that for daughters my fiance s says I don t think they re going to be home for Christmas All this time I tried to put up a facade of resilliance for her we keep fighting trust the system just tell the truth and she ll trip up over her own lies karma all that rubbish but it hit home that they weren t coming back from Christmas I had a pile of presents ready but no one would be here to open them Christmas day arrived and instead of celebrating it with my the people I love the most I m thinking of whether or not to jump 30 meters from a prominent bridge in our city to the water But I ve still got some fight back to Google back to the drawing board I dropped 4000 on a solicitor who gave me poor advice and a form to fill in to send to CAFCASS and their solicitor with requests That s 4000 I ll never get back I request a phycological assessment for the courts and this ends up being exactly what I needed we went there l took my 500 page folder with me she asks me questions I answer then proove with evidence she raises questions about how the case was handled Josie is interviewed where she lies the kids are interviewed which catches out more lose from Josie She s never been diagnosed with a mental health condition she does have a history of violence in relationships she s shown to consistently lie or manipulate facts she reported as manipulating our daughters against me She says she suffered abuse from her mum and abuse from me and even compares me to her mum It even mentions mums part in it I have finally been vindicated I have all this evidence printed I have a phycologist confirming what I m saying This really felt like the break through I needed After this supervised visits begin the lady supervising says from what I ve seen I really don t understand why I m here and after two visits we get unsupervised visits This is where things turn my elders daughter tells me that she s had suicidal thoughts A child Whatever Josie and mum has fed to these kids even if it is all lies it s real to them They re just kids how are they supposed to know I try talking with her And that s the last time a saw both of them CAFCASS carried on with their narrative disregarded everything the the phycologist said disregarded all evidence Josie basically has this pink haired overwait scumbag feminist in her pocket and me I represented everything that woman clearly hated There was no winning this case after everything I had submitted and proven I was no better off than day one And worse still because of the fighting because of the intervention by so many people my children were being affected whereby my eldest was suicidal I submitted a position statement airing my grievance but withdrawing my participation in the farce that is the so called family courts that hide behind the anonymity of children to conduct themselfes in a way that suits them without accountability I haven t seen my two daughters since 2022 and I think about them everyday I try to keep up with their lives where I can such as school reports but I really know very little about them now I know they hate me Josie and my mum did a good job in turning them against me and I m sure they ve told them I gave up on them but I haven t at all I m just waiting for the day they come back to find me I m so bored of social media but I want them to be able to find me easily even though I m sure Josie will have blocked me on their accounts If they Google my name I m always near the top of results but I just don t know what they ve been told about me or if they ll ever look for me I have a four year old daughter with my fiancé For the first year or so I fell into a deep depression where I didn t go out I felt guilty having fun or experiencing happiness without my daughter s Me and my fiancé talk about them all the time and our daughter asks about them We re now experiencing life again letting our daughter experience what they did like adventures learning school and so on but there s such a large hole from the gap that they leave I really wish in anyway that hole is filled up again As for my so called parents mums disabled on plenty of tablets and in constant pain for the rest of her life Dad is a door mat that waits on her hand on foot can t even take a shit in peace They move to new houses after destroying relationships with neighbors once they figure out what they are really like As far as I know they see the girls regularly and tell people that their son presumably me is an alcoholic Mum even tells people she was a barrister Those lies got set straight though as someone always knows some one who knows someone Last time I saw them they were picking Josie up from court with me I had them removed as McKenzie friends but I was nice to see Thier support after telling me they wouldnt get involved in supporting me in court when it all started to happen I genuinely wish them a long life as they ve lost 5 children who never want to speak to them they don t speak to parents or their siblings They have absolutely no one apart from the chronic pain and loneliness for the rest of their lives Almost makes you believe in karma As for Josie I don t know anything about her life and I m not interested I loved her once and don t think she ll ever know the effort I made to try and make her happy After everything she did to me I don t think she has an ounce of guilt She won I lost our daughter s and I m absolutely sure that makes her very happy She took every opportunity to look smug in court I ve seen bits and bobs a long time ago about her promoting people to stand up against domestic violence about suffering with BPD Bipolar and every other mental health disorder that she was never diagnosed with which tells me she can t feel guilty because she genuinely believes her own lies I do wonder if she ever has random thoughts of guilt though Maybe about taking away their daughters Dad or about what she put me through But I doubt it And me I m due to be married to the woman of my dreams We rearly disagree nevermind argue I have a promising career in the military joined an elite infantry unit the Ranger Regiment part of special operations briagde Have been awarded a 2 star commendation and mentioned on the kings new year s honours list for my service to date broke world records in the best shape of my life and travel everywhere enjoying life while we have it I m just patiently

text body: Hey I m 21 and my sister is 18 We used to be on decent terms before Covid but ever since then it feels like everything s gone downhill Her attitude towards me has completely shifted it s almost impossible to have a normal conversation without her snapping or raising her voice I get that this phase of life is tough sorting out uni figuring out who you are all of that I ve been through it too so I try to cut her some slack We both moved countries a few years ago and had to start from scratch with no friends or familiarity so in the beginning we leaned on each other a bit But as soon as she started getting the hang of things and found her own rhythm it s like she flipped a switch and became super bitter towards me I ve tried to bridge the gap I offer to hang out drive her places get food together vibe to songs in the car crack jokes to lighten the mood basically just trying to connect But it gets really exhausting especially because I constantly have to filter everything I say Even the smallest thing she doesn t like will set her off and suddenly she s yelling again It also feels pretty one sided She s never introduced me to her friends even though she knows mine I know that might sound petty but when small things like that keep adding up it starts to really sting Another layer to this is her health she s gained a lot of weight to the point that doctors were concerned and said she was borderline diabetic When I try to motivate her to come to the gym or be active she takes it as criticism and lashes out On top of that she manipulates situations with our parents and twists my words to make me look like the bad guy I don t even start the arguments but yes I do lose my temper after being constantly spoken to in that tone She doesn t help around the house either Anytime I ask her to do something it s met with a sigh or flat out refusal And if she does it it s with so much attitude that I wish I hadn t asked in the first place It s just lonely honestly We re only four years apart but we can t even sit down and talk or just enjoy each other s company I ve tried so hard but nothing changes If anyone s ever dealt with a sibling dynamic like this what advice would you give",21,,sibling

text body: I made a post on r family back in December after my last phone call with my dad but the short of it is My parents divorced about 2 3 years ago now and both have new partners My dad hates my mom s newer partner for more than just being a new partner The last time we talked was in December before my birthday and at the time I tried to convince him to attend my graduation to which he eventually said If it s easiest I won t go We literally haven t talked since then but I know he s alive cuz he s still active on face book It s not like it was a cut off conversation he just hasn t called and I haven t either Which I kind of regret now SO due to various circumstances my fiancé and I are moving in with my mom and her boyfriend now fiancé I definitely need to call or maybe write a letter to tell my dad but I don t really know what to say I probably should call him since he does currently still pay for my phone plan and I need to get that separated and sorted and don t wanna do that without his knowledge but I know if I ask he ll wonder why and I don t want to lie I m still pretty upset that my dad didn t call or send a card for my graduation It s just been complete radio silence for 6 months Anyways open to advice but I just kind of wanted to write this out cuz it sucks TLDR Moving in with my mom and her BF who my dad hates when I call my dad to tell him the bad news it ll be our first conversation in 6 months",,,child

author: melimel667
text body: Hi everyone I d really appreciate some advice Context My mom comes from a family with a long history of mental illness schizophrenia bipolar disorder etc and was always labeled as crazy My dad is an alcoholic and can be extremely uncaring like refusing to pick me up from the hospital after surgery when I was a kid not going to my sister s college graduation and even trying to give my other sister up for adoption because she was a troubled teenager They made sure we were fed clothed celebrated our birthdays hugged us and told us they loved us But they also beat us screamed constantly and fought with each other all the time Their fights were terrifying when I was little I remember my mom screaming she was going to kill my dad and him handing her a knife and daring her to do it Or her pouring gasoline on him while he slept drunk and saying she was going to set him on fire My sisters and I would cry and beg them not to hurt each other When I was around 8 or 9 I started stepping in to stop the fights Usually my dad being drunk triggered them so I d wait for him to get home and quietly take care of him so my mom wouldn t wake up and start screaming Eventually it became normal she d even send me to deal with him This is just a glimpse of what we went through I could fill pages with stories like these Why am I telling you all this Because my sisters and I grew up completely messed up And my dad refuses to acknowledge any of it I m 24 now When we were younger and struggling badly with our mental health we went through a phase of saying this is all your fault And it was My dad used to ignore it but now that we re older he says we re disrespectful liars who treat him and my mom like they re monsters He even agrees that the things we say if they were true would make them terrible parents But he just refuses to believe or admit that they actually did those things We had a big fight recently and he said we shouldn t talk to him anymore if we think he s so horrible It s not the first time he s said that Usually I just act like nothing happened after a while and he goes back to acting normal too But I know my dad If I don t take the initiative to fix things this time he really won t talk to me again I m tired This is making me sick emotionally and mentally I m already struggling even though I m doing better than I was as a child I still love him despite everything and I don t want to cut him off But his refusal to admit what he did and how cruel he could be is breaking me What should I do A bit about my mom We managed to convince her to see a psychiatrist when I was about 15 After starting medication she slowly got better Over time she began to realize how wrong her actions were She s very remorseful now She still causes drama sometimes and occasionally says things like That s in the past I don t know why you and your sister still cry about it but overall she s a hundred times better than she used to be And just to clarify the reason all of this keeps coming up is because my sisters and I still struggle deeply with mental health issues We re trying to build a healthy mindset now but we were never taught one It s like building something from scratch We re quick to anger like our mom I m never physically aggressive I hate aggression it makes me anxious but my older sister is we yell when upset we struggle with keeping our homes clean just like our parents did We grew up in a pretty dirty house and those habits are hard to unlearn I don t know what to do because I love them very much but I don t think I ll ever be able to get better around them I m a woman by the way",24,Female,daughter

text body: Hey So Im a 35 years old male and I have been thinking for many years why my parents and siblings treat me as a hero when there is some difficulties in life and when everything is fine Im like totally monster For example the latest is that I took my mother to live with me because in her apartment is water damage and they have to fix it for three months Some weeks ago she panicked that where she could go so I gave the solution Now two days ago my brother called her that his family is coming over for some party I told her that its ok but I go to my fathers place because I have to sleep because I work the night shift At that second she started to treat me like Im the biggest monster and now she is mad at my place This exact same happened one year ago when I bought her supplies to fix her apartment for 1000e because she had no money One week after I was the biggest asshole because I didnt take part of some party This has been going on my whole life And I cannot wrap my head around it",35,Male,

text body: I don t know why I tried to find validation from them for the things I would do I would try to mix my words up and say things that would not get them under my radar Although there are times where I think I can release my inhibitions and just express the way I like things to be expressed but there s a matter of suppression I have to get aware of because there are constantly judging Whenever I would explicitly express these things because I felt this growing urgency to feel proud and spread the proudness or joy there would be a reckless denial to feel that proudness So I ve been teaching myself to keep these things to myself and to congratulate things silently Of course there were wretched times where I would be met with silence or change of topic or get challenged or argumentative for zero reason That s why those dynamics I am trying to change and only accept what s possible with them Finding validation from family can be helpful especially if the timing is genuine",,,

dad doesn t really bother with us he used to be abusive to my mum No one else from my dad s side bothers and the same with my mums side so it s really just my mum and two older brothers 33 35 I ll start with my mum growing up my mum has always had different boyfriends and would make me go stay with them on weekends or have her random friends I don t know look after me while she would visit her boyfriends She s never really been very motherly and she s always moaning and bitching about 1 child over something I ve not really noticed until now I m 26 and my mum never shows us any affection such as hug us ask if we are okay how are day was or even that she loves us and i just thought this was normal until i seen how my boyfriends family treats him Birthdays are never really celebrated such as I ve had 1 birthday meal with my mum two brothers and auntie it was my 18th my auntie arranged it I dread Christmas as it s just awkward because we re not a close family and it feels forced My older brother ill call him Steve 35 is VERY aggressive and he intimidates me as he would always be kicking off when he lived at home such as smashing the house up shouting abuse at me my mum He says the worst things such as he s told my mum I hope she dies he s gonna beat her boyfriends up and he s even threatened me saying he s gonna hit me and hit my boyfriend He s just a hot head and he goes mad over the smallest things and still brings up past trauma and says he is the way he is because of my mum My mums kicked him Out multiple times and he s lived with my dad who is an alcoholic and abuses women He s also lived in hostels My other brother I ll call him mark 33 he s a lot calmer than Steve and he s more of a jokester but still has a bad side to him He s never had a Job and he s always sold drugs like Steve he s never had his own place and just lives with girlfriends or on my mums Sofa As much as he s not as bad as Steve he can still be aggressive but its mainly just with me for example I made some boiled eggs in the morning for breakfast and he was on the sofa and he shouted shut the fucking kitchen door as I walked past him to go back into my room and eat my eggs he said to this random girl he was talking to that he s gonna smash my face in and I m really pissing him off I have no idea why I m annoying him we barely speak also my mum NEVER defends me when my brothers are mean to me But recently ive been going through a really bad time at the moment as i had my phone hacked and videos of me and my bf where leaked to people I know and I was harassed for a few weeks for money I became really anxious to walk to work or the shops in case something would happen as my blackmailer knew where I lived My mum didn t really want me saying anything around her now ex bf because she didn t want to cause a scene and my older brother Steve called me a slag and said I was over reacting and because I lost it and told him to fuck off I never swear at my family he threatens to hit me and smash my room up while my mum is stood there saying nothing Mark tbf seemed kinda worried would ask me if the police have found anything yet even tho I wasn t allowed the police to come to the house because there s stuff hidden in the house Luckily I have a very supportive boyfriend because my family aren t the best but i decided to just stop talking to mark as him being so aggressive when I m going through a bad time really got to me I stopped talking to my mum about 2 weeks after because she made a comment about knowing I was upset but didn t say anything because her now ex boyfriend was in the house Fast forward it s been 6 months since I ve spoken to my older brother Steve and about 3 months since I ve spoken to my mum During this time my mum has constantly sighed walking past me or my room Gets up in the mornings is loud on purpose picks and chooses when she s making me tea but when she doesn t she will let me know as late as possible like 7pm She has spoken to me once but it was very rude she just started shouting asking what my problem was and that I m being hostile and she s done nothing wrong and I make the atmosphere in the house negative I don t like confrontation so I just tried my hardest not to cry because I felt abit embarrassed that it was in front of my bf and I knew if I said something then it would kick off So i waited until she cooled down and sent her a text while she was at work it wasn t rude it was just explaining that I m going through a hard time and she s not supportive she read it and ignored it My mums heard me on the phone to the police and not once asked me about the case or if I m okay The other week I was away for my boyfriend s birthday and we come back the day of his birthday in the evening and my mum and brother kicked off because they accused me of breaking the washing machines even tho my boyfriend explained that I didn t As soon as my boyfriend walks upstairs my brother says pay for it or move out and I just lost it and told him to get fucked so my mum comes upstairs saying I was out of order for saying that and I need to pay for it then I started crying and this just made her more angry and said why am i crying and I m immature Mark just kept laughing calling me a baby So know I m not talking to my mum or two brother and my anxiety is crazy and even going down stairs is hard I just stay in my room but I can hear them bitch about me I just feel hopeless because I just want a loving family",26,Female,

text body: My brother constantly disregards my boundaries Recently I was studying in my study room when he came in and sat in my bedroom area even after I asked him to leave over 20 times He claimed that our mom told him to be there but I was clearly uncomfortable and annoyed I started lecturing him about his unrealistic goals like wanting to be a cardiac surgeon along with other medical specialties explaining that it would be mentally exhausting Then he started bringing up religion saying that God has written down everything that will happen to us He claimed I could still pass with high grades even without studying if it was meant to be When I disagreed he mocked me accusing me of not believing in God He stayed for about an hour even as I argued with him and I suspected he was recording me When my mom came to check on us I asked them to leave but she took it as me wanting her out too and she sided with him I got so frustrated that after they left I went to his room cursed him out and started kicking the trash cans and throwing his clothes on the floor He recorded me again and then pushed me to the ground When I broke down and said that my mom always takes his side he just laughed I tried telling him how much his actions hurt me but he admitted he doesn t feel guilty at all It hurt to hear that because I realized he really doesn t care It s not just this incident there s a pattern of him never feeling bad for anything even when our pets died I m just exhausted and overwhelmed from constantly dealing with his behavior especially when it feels like my mom always takes his side It has always been a sensitive topic for me when I see my mother taking his side my anger just explodes I know I need to control my anger and just deal with it But why can t he just respect my decision He says very mean things to me even regarding my journey to medical world He thinks I don t deserve it Many many things Sometimes I catch myself wishing that he was not related to me",,,sibling

text body: hello everyone english is not my first language so if there are mistakes forgive me So I male 18 live with my dad 42 and sister 15 a little back story i was raised in small village along with my siblings and life in village has its bad and good sides good side was playing in open fields and exploring forests and playing in family tree houses when i said family i mean that it previously belongs to my cousins and now it was ours Then when i was 12 we moved to city to live with our family our family lives very close i mean door to door Now bad side was working people from village would know now lets start with story my father is alcoholic and was as long as i can remember when we were little he would always come home drunk and argue with my mom and grandma sometimes he would throw something at them i remember one time i was sitting in living room with mom and my father would come drunk and yell at me for playing with toys or for juts chewing gum now to present my father heard some rumors that my mom cheated on him they did paternity test and turn out my younger brother is not related to my father there was a big fight and he threw my mom out but he leave my brother with us but week later he also send my brother to live with mom but i and my sister stayed with our father Month later he also wanted to do paternity test for me and my sister the test took month to be ready and our father make that month hell for us he would consistently tell us if we were not his he would kick us out and stuff like that and he would tell us if we were his he would stop drinking and be a better man When test arrived it proved thet we were his biological children But instead of quiting alcohol he wanted to know who was father of our brother he would consistently call my mom and ask her there were 2 times when he was drunk that he threw my sister and me to go to our mom but next day when he was sober he would ask us to return and we return Now your probably wondering why we returned so lets answer it my father is good man hardworking but it is all in vain when all the money he earn he spend in bar with his friends so my mom had to raise us basically on her own with our grandma now when mom is gone my sister had to do chores around the house like cleaning washing clothes and stuff like that i also help of course but our father would always bring his friends and they would mess the whole house and my sister would have to clean it about food we dont know how to cook so our grandma would send us food or our ant and uncle would call us for dinner breakfast and lunch now we are allowed to go to our mother and brother but for little time so we go after school becouse our father dont know how many classes we have so we go to our brother who is 10 years old i forgot to mention when our mother is at work so he is not alone we also bring most important things to our mom for me ist my manga and lego collection in case he threw us out again and this time we would not return but then our parents would divorce officially and that would mean my little sister might end up with our father becouse he has strings in police and know some people from court so i fear if she end up with him he would hurt her so please give me your thoughts on this",18,Male,son

text body: Just got back from a family trip to Japan with our two kids ages 6 and 10 and I wanted to share what worked what didn t and what I wish we knew earlier We tackled everything from long haul flights and jet lag to food hotels and activities like the Ghibli Museum and the Nintendo Museum both were unforgettable experiences Japan was amazing but it took some planning to make it enjoyable for everyone I have also put together a video that cover the topic see comment Some quick takeaways Direct flights with nighttime hours saved our sanity Low dose melatonin for kids helped us manage jet lag during the flight and the first few days Choose hotels with extra space even then it might feel tight We found that staying in a ryokan was a great experience for the kids they loved the futons tatami floors and trying out a bit of traditional Japan IC Cards like Suica or Pasmo are a must Get them at the ticket office for kids under 12 they travel half price with passport proof And kids under 5 ride free with a paying adult Kid friendly food is everywhere Convenience store favorites like egg mayo sandwiches katsu sando and tuna mayo onigiri saved us more than once Restaurants like shabu shabu and yakiniku where you cook at the table are fun interactive and safe for kids with some supervision Conveyor belt sushi places like Sushiro are a huge hit some even offer chances to win pocket toys depending on what you order Stamp rallies Gashapon machines instant kid motivation The Ghibli Museum and Nintendo Museum were the highlights for our kids interactive visually rich and perfect for little fans of animation and gaming We didn t need a stroller but if you bring one go for a lightweight foldable option that can squeeze into packed trains and buses easily If you re thinking about traveling to Japan with kids or just curious how it actually plays out I hope this helps Happy to answer any questions or hear your family travel",,,parent

text body: I m dealing with a concerning and unusual situation involving my brother J and I m looking for guidance To maintain privacy I ve left out some identifying details I moved in with my mom into a two bedroom apartment Things were peaceful for a while just the two of us living together Later my brother who had been living across the country asked to move in My mom feeling lonely agreed even though it meant all three of us would share the space including one bathroom I had mixed feelings but we made it work by setting up a curtain in the living room to give him some privacy At first everything seemed normal But after a few weeks things started to feel off One night while I was up late on my phone I heard him go to the bathroom What caught my attention was the sound of heavy walking and faint whispering At first I brushed it off But it kept happening Eventually I quietly approached the bathroom and listened I could hear him talking to himself incoherently and intensely while pacing It was disturbing like something you d associate with a person experiencing a psychotic break A few nights later I heard him again this time from behind his curtain in the living room He was whispering to himself making strange noises and muttering violent sounding things I did once casually mention him being loud in the bathroom but I never told him I overheard the whispering or strange behavior He doesn t seem to know I m aware Some important context The whispering is incoherent but sounds agitated or violent He has no known history of mental illness though there is a family history on our mother s side During the day he acts completely normal My mom who works long hours is unaware of any of this He s into sports and generally behaves like a typical adult He often talks about being a billionaire through day trading though there s no evidence to support it these could be delusions of grandeur I m concerned and unsure what to do Could this be a sign of a mental health issue Should I intervene and if so how Would you like help identifying possible mental health conditions or figuring out the best next steps to take",,,sibling

author: AdThen5499
text body: Tl dr older sister keeps complaining she s not happy with her career and living at home with our mum I don t know whether to keep being sympathetic or just tell her some hard truths My older sister 36 lives at home with my mum For reference I m 32 She went to uni then moved in with her boyfriend That didn t end well so she moved home Luckily the spare room was free because I was at uni living elsewhere In my mum s flat there is only two bedrooms and we d always shared growing up So it just so happened that our old room was free so she moved home to start fresh Only the issue is that our home town is not really good for employment The only jobs are retail or working in the local gym Or joining the army She studied film and did a master s in filmmaking so we d always figured she d go into that industry But after university she struggled and worked in retail which she s been doing up until the present approx 15 years on and off She doesn t enjoy it to the point she was borderline suicidal when she worked full time in a shop Because of this she went part time without asking my mum first if she could handle her paying less into bills and rent My mum being the saint she is agreed but she did hint to me she wasn t happy about it My sister also said she was going part time to give herself the time to search for a job she actually wants Well she s been searching for over a year now maybe 18 months And still she s working part time in a shop and complaining she doesn t have any idea what to do job wise To me it s obvious She s so knowledgeable in film knows the ins and outs of filmmaking due to her degrees bachelor and a master s and goodness knows she loves movies and television she should work in that industry or at least give it a good go to try get a job in that area But when I asked her about it she just cited it s bad for job security and that was the old me but I kinda feel like that s a copout I think she s scared of failure and disappointing everyone If you really want to do something you do it despite the risks surely I was so desperate to work in my field that I took a job in another country But she seems to be just ignoring the field which was once her dream job She s just looking at generic jobs nearby now But she wants to move out of our home town So why bother looking at jobs in the same town I dunno I feel like she can t admit to herself what she really wants to do What she s really talented at writing and film I ve always been the sympathetic ear whenever she calls me for the annual I m not getting anywhere I want to be happy but I m not conversation But as I m getting older and having my own work life frustrations I have less and less patience for her repeating the same stuff every single time She gets to work part time pay less rent if any sometimes have lots of free time to work on her mental health while I have to work full time to be able to afford living an independent life me and my boyfriend have rent to pay and we can t slack off when we want to I have my own mental health issues but I still gotta work because I want money to pay for things hell i ve had health issues but I still had to go to work I went through a period of chronic headaches and tmj issues and just got on with it because I had to Like I just wish she could see the bigger picture here Which is if she didn t have my mum or if my mum wasn t being so nice she would have to work full time to be able to afford rent and food etc I don t think she realises how lucky she is I m not jealous of her I m actually glad I never moved home for the exact reason my sister is struggling now But sometimes I just want to shake her and say get a grip and get a job Want to move out You gotta work Want a job you love You gotta be brave and go for it Want to protect your mental health Babe you already got the skills she s already in therapy and knows her triggers now It s not like she has been so bad that she was taken to a psych ward Sure depression is not a small issue but I think her case is manageable especially if she s doing a job she s actually interested in and getting paid well for I remember having this I feel lost conversation with her when she turned 30 a few years ago I just don t want to be having the same conversation when she turns 40 Because I know she ll be beside herself And there s nothing I can do because it s not my life It s hers I also feel like living at home has kind of stunted her life experience Living in your childhood home and sleeping in the room you grew up in has got to do something to your brain in terms of restricting how far you can go as an adult because you have constant reminders of who you were as a kid Living with my mum in a small town dating is non existent job opportunities are limited your independence limited The time in my life when I really saw growth in myself was when I moved out and lived away from my parents Apart from the job career situation I feel like she s missing out on so much life stuff she should be enjoying as a single thirty something Hell that she should have been enjoying in her twenties And sometimes that leads to her not really having a grip on reality like I do rent isn t gonna pay for itself the only person who can change your life is you you can t expect people to go easy on you more often than not they go hard on you life is frickin hard complex a grey area I ve learnt all of this stuff but I don t think she has She is still on the hunt for perfection the perfect job the life calling And I know from life experience living on my own that the perfect everything is a con There is no perfect job I don t love my job but I can do it because I have the skills and I enjoy some parts of the job But am I working on my passion projects outside of work Hell yeah Her pursuit of finding the perfect job is actually hindering her search She s putting way too much pressure on herself to get it right this time Do you know what it is that frustrates me It s the fact she is expecting the perfect career the the purpose in life kinda career the independence of living on her own but she isn t willing to graft for it because she might get burned out again Please if most people went part time because they were a tiny bit burnt out the economy would crumble To me her fear of full time work because it might make me depressed again is just not good enough It s not realistic if you want to be independent I d love to take a say off when my medication makes me feel depressed do I though No because I live in reality And her being so out of touch sometimes pees me off a bit Because I HAVE TO go to work I feel bad saying all this about my sister I love her soo much I just want her to be happy but you know when someone is telling you they re not happy again and again and yet they re not really putting themselves out there to make themselves happy Yeah it gets to ya after a while One conversation went like this Sister Ah my car needs work done on it I don t have the money I need more money Me Okay can you pick up some extra shifts at work Have you considered full time work again Sister I dunno I m just worried I ll get depressed again Ne Okay so don t work any more hours Sister But I need money And round and round it went It was so frustrating Has anyone else had a similar experience with a sibling who seems lost and isn t reaching the goals they want Do you give them the sympathetic ear or do you go hard on them",32,,sibling

text body: I F24 live in the UK in the same house as my mum F53 I m autistic and have ADHD I get benefits but they go into her bank account because she doesn t want me to work I don t even know how much I get per month because she won t tell me When she was married to my dad she used to cheat on him and would sext married men She still does it and one time was even planning to have sex with a guy not much older than me in my house while I was asleep in the next room Didn t know this guy from Adam and he could ve been a rapist or anything so I didn t feel safe There was also a guy she d been seeing for a couple of weeks when I was 17 who always commented on how beautiful I was and saying he d have to chase boys away he was 48 and she let him stay overnight despite my protests and the fact she d only known him for 2 weeks I really want to move out but with my circumstances it s so hard to get my own place My mum loves to tell everyone I m autistic and makes out I m much worse than I am in order to seek sympathy and validation I was on holiday with my family and my boyfriend and she tried to take my bra off in front of my dad because I had chest pain I pushed her hands away and she said I attacked her My dad and my boyfriend were pissed off with her for trying to take off my bra in front of my dad and how uncomfortable it made me She is also an absolute clean freak and has too much energy always playing her music too loud I find her very overwhelming My boyfriend M27 may have undiagnosed autism and he even gets overwhelmed by my mum She accused him of being ignorant and having no respect for her but he just doesn t know how to deal with her and he said she treats me like I m 12 which concerns him yet it s okay when her friend s son who she s wanted me to be with since we were children to be a completely rude prick and she ll talk about how much of a lovely successful handsome boy he is She forced me to kiss him at her wedding when I was 4 and you can clearly see me looking uncomfortable and leaning away in the picture and I got in trouble for being rude It really fucked up my understanding of consent because a girl sexually abused me when I was 9 and then my ex raped me three and a half years ago and I felt really uncomfortable telling her She tries to guilt trip me into being friends with her best friend s daughter who was bombarding me with messages which overwhelmed me she has a learning disability so I don t think she understood my boundaries or my personal space which absolutely wasn t her fault but we have absolutely nothing in common either As a child she never showed me how to do household tasks so I don t know how to do some things I don t know if she genuinely forgot or it was some kind of deliberate ploy so that I can t leave I m never allowed to be unwell have a migraine which I get quite a lot be forgetful due to my ADHD or be tired without being accused of being lazy She constantly accuses me of things I didn t do and I have to shout the truth at her until I m blue in the face She also accuses me of laughing at her when I haven t I don t know what to do I feel so stuck and I can t even get my own place because I don t know how much money I get and I m not allowed a job She s also my appointee and wanted herself and my brother to get guardianship of me I just want to be treated like a normal woman for fuck sake I can t stand the pitiful looks I get from random people that know her but don t even know me",24,Female,daughter

text body: I cannot stand my F19 younger brother M17 For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers F46 mental illness and various crises she s experiences and our fathers M52 general absence We don t have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me To be clear my brother I ll call X for simplicity has no known mental illnesses disabilities or other issues that would delay mental emotional development I have been diagnosed with GAD OCD and depression My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house For context My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard all while doing nothing to assist So this being the situation it was expected that the kids being me and X would clean the house However for no known reason except X s own selfishness and presumed laziness the chores would fall to me If the house was not kept to a certain and often unknown standard I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment I say no known because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X Following suit as we ve grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me My mother being in her free girl and spiritual era has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about Being that I have OCD one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough I am also in my third year of University currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85 I have explained to both my mom and X I don t bother with my dad because he s not in the picture right not how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes Earlier today the event that prompted me to write this I was at work Around 11 30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse Typically when I message him he won t respond so he can claim he didn t see the text At 11 50 I messaged him again reminding him of what was asked I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded I asked him kindly again to unload the dished He told me to fuck off This is not the first time this has happened I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house To be clear this kid has school from 9 11 having a third period spare meaning he has a 2 hour lunch He is in grade 12 or a senior we are from Canada When I was in grade 12 I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework He sits of the couch and either a sleeps or b plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans not sure if that s what its called I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called self centred and from my mom I get a I will talk to him or a lay off of him In my opinion nothing has changed I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues which she fucking knew about and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me This job was also 30 minutes away from my house I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time it felt like the end of the world So far X has looked for two jobs One being at the end of his grade 11 year this one was promised to him but fell through and is my moms words disappointed him and makes him not want to try again and then again recently dropping his resume off at a dollarama It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school keeping my grades above a 95 average I know it was only high school however it still took quite a bit of time and energy working around 25 hours a week and keeping the house clean He has no job is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes and has no responsibilities around the house My second issue is his choice of words He often uses slurs such as the r n f I the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada and many more He is a cis het white male for any context While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities it is still incredibly harmful I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world He is unfortunately falling down the alt right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it He consistently refers to me and my mom as bitches and to me as a fat fuck or a slut whore Again words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now let alone when I was 17 I would be screamed at My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep Since I was in grade 4 I have been getting myself X and my mom up in time for school My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up feed the pets Dogs and cats let them out to play make mine and X s lunch for the day make myself breakfast X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up We are out the door by 8 25am As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day Thankfully as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something I still hate being late let the record be known However I have not been in Gen Ed for nearly 3 years now and still have to wake X up My mom thankfully has gotten better however she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession beginning the process of waking him up at 7 30 to give him an extra half hour pulling the blankets off him spraying him with water which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist yelling and using a very loud alarm Nothing works He never wakes up I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5 30am I am so fucking tired I don t even know what to do I don t know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop I don t know how much I can take of this anymore I just want to be a kid and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can t keep doing this",19,Female,sibling

text body: This will be the final update to this situation In short we re going to get a divorce My 32M husband 33M is much worse than I thought he was All of you who said I was in the wrong for giving him more chances You were all right Our relationship is beyond fixing After my last update I continued doing what I said I d do focus on my sister 24F and on figuring myself out I left my phone open for only my sister both of my SILs 28 and 18F and work Things didn t get any easier and if anything the letter my husband passed me and the fact that SIL2 read it and felt awful made everything worse and harder I still wanted to give my husband a chance I love him We ve been together for twelve years I wanted to calm down and talk to him I wanted to ask that piece of shit why he told my sister to stay away from me and why he pretended to speak on my behalf Even if it didn t change anything I wanted answers I was giving him the benefit of the doubt I was hoping there was some explanation we could work through that didn t end in divorce Anything I love him He was the first person I ever felt like I was at home with after leaving home at 18 He s tried to get in contact with me multiple times through SIL1 and SIL2 but besides telling me husband is trying to get us to pass messages to you they didn t cooperate with him I m thankful for that I wasn t in the mindspace to hear anything about him I was too upset Both of them are very angry at him too specially SIL1 who can t forgive him for the horrific things he said about little siblings in the letter SIL2 read SIL1 adores SIL2 She s trying to pretend reading that nonsense didn t hurt her too but I m sure reading her own brother say those awful things hurt her too SIL1 s just the type to hurt silently To summarize a long story on Saturday SIL1 called me and said my in laws MIL and FIL needed to talk to me about my husband And that even though I don t want to hear about him it was urgent So I went over to their place and we had lunch together SIL1 was there too After they found out about the entire fiasco after SIL2 read the damn letter they ve been talking a lot to my husband Apparently he wasn t the good older brother he seemed to be his whole life MIL and FIL told me that when SIL1 was born my husband wasn t happy with her That s kinda normal for kids but it appears he resented her and pretended she didn t exist for well into his teens Same with SIL2 when she was born and he was 15 by then It seems like he s always always been overly jealous of them and overly jealous in general SIL1 never told me this because she thought her brother was over it and that it wouldn t affect me and our relationship now that he s an adult in his 30s She was wrong I m not blaming her he did seem remarkably normal when I met him and I wouldn t have even suspected he was the one behind my sister s distance with me if SIL1 hadn t told me immediately Anyway besides being abnormally jealous of his little sisters once he got to like them MIL and FIL told me my husband would go as far as to keep his friends away from the house and go out of his way to not invite them because he was scared his friends would like his sisters better than him or that his sisters would like his friends better MIL and FIL tried getting him to go to therapy when they found out but he refused to talk to his therapist SIL1 only found that out recently She didn t know why she never got to meet her brother s friends After finding out his pathological jealousy was still in action when they found out about what my husband did to my sister when the whole situation exploded with the letter they ve been talking to him and prodding him to tell them why he felt so threatened by my little sister While he was closed off at first he s always caved in to confiding in MIL Basically when he met me and learnt of my broken relationship with my family he thought I was perfect because he would never have to share me He never said anything to this effect in the past twelve years He s always expressed sympathy for my situation and when I told him I wanted to reach out to my sister again he encouraged me Retrospectively all this is terrifying The worst part is why he snapped when he did however He told me it was because I had a sleepover with my sister on a night he wasn t supposed to be home and that I couldn t put my sister over my husband Apparently that was a lie He told MIL the truth and this is what convinced me to divorce him A few weeks before the sleepover night SIL1 SIL2 husband my sister and I went out for drinks We all overdid it a little but I drank more than all of them and passed out on the table at the club before we left While SIL1 and SIL2 were at the bathroom my husband asked my sister why she wasn t drinking and she confessed to my husband that she has a brain tumor It isn t very dangerous for now and it doesn t interfere too much with her daily life she s on epilepsy meds and that s mostly contained the problem so she s on the watch and wait approach Treatment will vary depending on if or when it starts growing and how quickly She told him she was scared of telling me because since I walked out on her when she was little she s terrified that I ll walk out on her again if she becomes too much of a problem He promised her he d help her tell me when she felt ready Instead since he and I have been considering adoption for a while he told MIL that he didn t want me getting distracted from his family if my sister s tumor progresses and that it was better to get rid of her before she took all my attention Plus that it would be cruel for his kids to get attached to their aunt if she s as good as gone I broke down When I calmed down enough I went home packed some bags and got on the first flight to the country that bastard sent my sister running off to when he told her she was taking up too much space I basically appeared on her doorstep and hugged her the moment she opened the door We spoke a lot over the weekend and I told her she isn t a problem She put me up to date with her situation and told me she didn t want to be a problem and that she doesn t want to get between me and my family The only person who got between me and my family was my exhusband My sister did nothing wrong I m going to stay by her side come what may I had to be back home on Monday for work I m trying to get working remotely set up so I can move to my sister s city I don t know how much time we have left before that thing starts growing I hope it won t but I m not the most optimistic guy Whatever happens I won t leave her alone When I told her I wanted to stay with her she also broke down I m never leaving her again I ve started talking to a lawyer for the divorce MIL FIL SIL1 and SIL2 are all on my and my sister s side My husband is dead to SIL1 and SIL2 after all that s happened and MIL and FIL are still trying to get him to get professional help because he needs it Before finding out the full truth I wanted to help him get help if he needed it too While I still hope he gets his head sorted out and wish him the best I can t be part of his healing journey even if part of me still loves him Whatever is wrong with him he has to fix it far away from me and my sister and his sisters too for the time being at least This is the final update It ended in divorce Considering everything that s the part I care about the least Thanks to everyone who was kind and to everyone who was rough and gave me a good dose of reality in the comments on the other posts You all helped make me feel less lost during some very trying times Tl dr my husband who had tried to sabotage my reconciliation with my sister by telling her some awful things supposedly in my name is a worse person than I thought He hid that my sister has a tumor because he was afraid of how me supporting my sister would affect him Naturally I am working on a divorce and on moving closer to my sister",32,Male,husband

text body: 20F I found out yesterday that I ve been disowned This was after I had an argument with my dad in a pharmacy he embarrassed me by answering for me very loud in the back and making it clear to them I have some sort of speech issue i don t she didn t hear one number of my birth year but he still think I m 11 and introverted I told him to go outside and because I had some authority in my voice now he was embarrassed We ve never argued in public so it was worse in that sense but he made sure to call me every bad thing he could think of right there in Arabic My dad told my mom either I leave this Friday or he will Of course it s not a question even though he works maybe 14 hours a month my family depend on him emotionally and financially But I just don t think what happened is enough ground to remove me Just before that we were talking about the weather and when I would take my driving test Nothing leading up It s true that we don t have the best relationship anyway my dad spends most of his time saying I stink or my uni work is a waste of time because it s not a big uni or when I almost got married off in January not willing all the pictures I had were either catfish to him or ugly Even said he ll have to stick a picture of you on the bedframe so he doesn t have to think about what lays next to him And when I cried and complained he said it was all a joke of course Somehow I should ve known that Point is despite this rant I don t think I did enough to be disowned I do see it as some misogyny because my brother has had similar or worse arguments and he never experienced some sort of silent treatment I get this from my dad and my mom the latter sometimes worse as she d ignore me months at a time Even in the house I ve been confined to my room I m not allowed out for dinners or prayer he doesn t want to see me My mom was upset mostly because I didn t do enough I should ve cried more begged more But when he asked me to leave I did and I immediately started searching for my options I have options already and I m trying to get my benefits sorted so I can get into shared housing until I can find work as I only just finished uni and still haven t graduated My two brothers have avoided me since Worst part about this is I have a new baby sister that s 2 months and having been an only girl my whole life I looked forward to raising her and seeing her grow and hear her call me sister And I won t get that anymore What can I do right now what should I be doing Edit guess I got renowned didn t have to go anywhere because my mom managed to convince my dad she d need my help in the house with my sister to deal with because of course we ethnics don t teach our men about housework So I m back in under rules of a supreme maid talk quietly cook and clean without being asked or reminded and do everything as told Mind you I said if you want a maid I ll hire one and ofc it got worse But yeah with my financial status I ll be stuck here a little longer but thank you to everyone for the advice I ll keep it in mind for next time soon enough 3",20,Female,daughter

729,My Father Lost His Mind and I Don’t Know How to Procceed,"title: My Father Lost His Mind and I Don’t Know How to Procceed
author: DraftMany925
text body: This post is going to come off a little trauma dumpy but I am very desperate for advice so just a little disclaimer in advance Edit I go off on some tangents so please excuse my inability to just simply tell the story My father 42 for the last couple of years has been on the mental decline At first it seemed like something you would see in someone much older repeating questions or phrases several times in a row and not noticing Having horrible memory seemingly dropping intelligence significantly and all that That gave me initially just the kind of slight annoyance you get with having to deal with that especially of someone so young But as the years went by it changed more and more alarmingly as time went on The first I became aware of the changes was when I was roughly 19 or 20 I am 21 now for reference and he nearly killed me in a drunk driving episode Context I got in the car with him Not knowing he was drunk because he never really was a drinker and immediately he started swerving down the rode Again didn t think much of it because he always drives on his phone and is general a abysmal driver But after side swiping a semi trailer and hitting a guard rail I became painfully aware of him drinking I am a very reserved and shy person and hate confrontation so I didn t say anything even after I knew and became so terrified I started violently trembling This led to him berating me about being scared of him when he noticed my trembling and even threatening me Eventually he drove straight there the red light on a four lane intersection and that was the final straw until I threatened to call the police on him and he reluctantly handed over the wheel I am summarizing a bit but this was the day I truly started to put an assortment of events and things he d done together and notice the decline of his mental stability After this transpired he began to develop what I can only explain as the mind of a child Also Homelander from The Boys is a great representation of what he is like if you ve watched the show He developed in insatiable need to feel accomplished and loved by everyone around him while constantly treating everyone and everything like human garbage I ll give a couple examples He makes dinner once every three months or so and when he finally gets everyone to eat he will force my family to say how good the meal was over ten times sometimes more the most he ever forced my mother to praise him was nearly 15 times by slamming the table and giving death stares until he is somewhat satisfied by our forced false praise Another example is my mother is a softball coach and my sister plays for the team she coaches This is important because one obviously I want to support my sister so I would go to games to watch her And every single game I swear to you for hours and game after game he would do nothing but complain about my mother not acknowledging him sitting in the stand when she is in the middle of coaching a team of young teenage girls during a game And he would complain and complain about how no one cared about him because people who pay attention to my sister during her own softball games On the topic of my sister he is extremely misogynistic and is very demeaning of women in general Does not comprehend periods and will belittle my sister for simply using women hygiene products that kind of behavior This will be a final example to kind of illustrate the picture to what kind of a person he is but I have two wonderful dogs who are unfathomably intelligent Border collies So admittedly they are much more behaved than a normal dog Completely understand any command you give them will come back in the house if you call for them that kind of thing But despite them being so well behaved it isn t enough for my father who began to hit them for misbehaving even though they have rarely so much as have an accident My one dog has seizures not because of brain damage he caused but goes to show he is willing to hit an epileptic dog This caused my one dog to cower and hide from him at every opportunity and this enrages him Going back to needing to be constantly showered in praise and affection while treating everyone like garbage I know I said last example from the past but I ll give another while I m thinking about it treating others like garbage but expecting everyone to love him He will make quick comments like another story but he has gone up to my sister and said phrases along the lines of You re horrible at softball or you have no friends Elementary school bully behavior and will immediately go to another tangent and expect everyone to happily listen and talk with him as if he didn t insult the person he was talking to Now you probably get an idea of how he s been acting in the past I ll fast forward to the last week and his life is seemingly more of the rails than ever He now talks to himself will make sounds for no reason he ll stand and shake like a psychotic movie character Every sentence he speaks is like speaking to either an 8 year old or and 88 year old no sentence really means much of anything But on Friday he quit his job completely left everything at our job site and just quit We work the same job unfortunately There was no planning no nothing my mother didn t know I didn t know I learned from a text he sent my coworker that he completely quit He spent the first couple days mindlessly scrolling YouTube shorts and today he was drunkenly sprawled out on the living room floor making noises Also he yelled at me for beginning to cook dinner because he wanted hot dogs and I should have know that s what he wanted But now that I am at this point I am completely dumbfounded on what to do I am 90 sure he has psychosis or something along the lines of it My sister insists he is bipolar which she is right Now the problem is my mother has been a stay at home mom since before he started going off the deep end and is still that Which means I am the only one in the house with a job as a 21 year old guy My father basically burned every bridge he had at his last job and is now too mentally unwell at least I think to ever be hired somewhere else And now I m finding hundreds of dollars worth of lottery tickets alcohol fast food of his just laying around He is also seemingly becoming more violent I came up with an excuse last Friday to not ride in to work in the same car as him because of trauma and all that but I put on a happy face and gave a legitimate excuse This caused him to not openly show it but he stood in the doorway eyes bulging and body twitching and as I was getting ready I heard him under his breath say I m going to fucking murder him over something as trivial as that So the conclusion to my book Or for anyone unwilling to read the entire story which I understand My father who is almost definitely psychotic left his job is becoming increasingly unstable and potentially violent basically ruined every relationship and opportunity he has in life Leaving me to one just wanting to get out of the house and leave and never come back But I m terrified of what might happen to my sister or mom if he continues to worsen Not only am I scared he may become violent to them I m terrified I ll have to financially care for them if he snaps I do have 45k saved up from working full time since high school Which seems like a lot at first but to start a new independent life and care for my family seems impossible to me Also I have never confronted him about his behavior because he is severely depressed and I feel like if confront him about his behavior he will legitimately kill himself So I can t get him to see anyone about his mental stability to fix our problems that way without him crashing out on me for even suggesting it And I truly am at the point where I know it s wrong to feel this way but I do not have any want or incentive to help him anymore It feels like a waste of my time So I suppose I m just very lost I m terrified for my sister and mother s future and don t know how to escape this chapter of my life If anyone has experience like this I would love to know your approach Also I m skipping out on a large amount of details and events so if there is context I left out in my rambling then let me know please Thank you anyone who is willing to read my trauma dump you are incredibly kind",21,Male,son

text body: I put NSFW just due to explicit background FYI my Dad s side of the family is a fucking wreck as you are about to find out Also for clarification I have 3 siblings 22M diagnosed with autism M40 half brother F40 crackhead estranged sister I recognize if any of them sees this I wont escape it lol but whatever at this point idc I 24M have a transgender half brother M40 who no one in my family knew about until I was 3 y o He was the result of a one night fling 40 years ago My dad M62 and my half brother have both tried to reconcile over the years multiple times lived together for a time and stayed on ok terms for a bit However around 5 years ago when visiting my half brother my dad said something to piss him off he freaked out on him they got in an intense punching fight while I was sleeping and we left the next day We didn t hear from my half brother for like 4 years however they had apparently reconciled during that time Anyways fast forward and my 16 year old cousin committed suicide Over the years my half brother and one of my cousins family on my dad s side had gotten very close with one another and the kids would frequently visit him every summer for a couple weeks My half brother contacts me and shares the news with me first and we got back in touch ever since chatting every week or so During this period he and my dad tried to reconcile as well and went on a family vacation During this vacation allegedly my dad was extremely drunk the entire trip and consistently made vulgar and transphobic comments towards my brother the entire trip Apparently he would walk around the apartment with his dick out disturbing my brother When my brother called him out on it he made vulgar comments to him waved his dick around in his robe and taunted him From my Dad s side again allegedly my half brother was the issue He walked around the apartment would not put up his robe and let his boobs hang out the entire time in front of my dad and his friend They were disgusted by it told him to cover up and he refused Ever since then they have both hated each others guts Here is where I fall into play I have stayed on great terms with my half brother at least on his end He constantly says how much he loves me is glad we have stayed connected and can t wait until my dad dies and we can take all his money Yeah I m not all about that My dad has stated numerous times my half brother is not getting anything its all going to me etc However further caveat we have no idea if he has even created a will or not As of the time he and my mom split up 4 years ago he did not have a will He claims to have made one but it never goes past it s taken care of No proof of anything We highly doubt he does We highly suspect its not and as a result the will is going to be split between everyone With all that being said fast forward to the past 2 months My half brother called me and told me that my half sister the crackhead was recently manipulated she has severe mental disabilities due to excessive meth usage and taken out of a hospital by a creep with multiple sexual assault charges who took her back to his place in the middle of the woods and raped her This is someone who I have not had any contact with for 15 years outside of family funerals where she was strictly prohibited by my parents from talking to me My half brother used this to get in contact with my dad s side of the family and basically guilt tripped my dad into taking her in He spent over 1 000 getting her out paying for Ubers hotels etc Apparently every six months she calls him begging for help because she gets kicked out of shelters either for A relapsing or B having seizures from her epilepsy he claims shelters won t take her because of the liability I m skeptical But anyway he used this situation to pressure the family until my dad agreed to take her in She s been staying with him for the past couple weeks Also worth mentioning I have a full brother 22M who s autistic and is not aware of any of this however he loves my half brother and hates my dad I will fully admit my dad plays favorites has clearly established me as his favorite and for the most part ignored my full brother because he cant relate to him due to his autism I m in no way saying I believe my dad is either a good or bad person My dad keeps saying he s not leaving my half brother anything but if there s no will that s probably not enforceable Meanwhile my mom keeps telling me I need to protect myself She believes my dad s version of events more than my half brother s thinks he exaggerates a lot but admits some parts are probably true She s also convinced he s going to try to guilt me or pressure me into giving him money if when my dad passes and the inheritance is settled don t need to convince me I already know this is going to happen She also is really pissed at my dad because if he doesn t have a will she knows I am going to have to go through hell dealing with both my half brother and especially my half sister who is a wild card She basically told me You are the only responsible one left and they are both going to come after you for money the second dad dies which I fully realize and agree with her on thank god she is a stable good person and a badass mom At this point im stuck in this mess and will have to deal with it one day whether or not thats in 6 months 6 years or 20 years he drinks to much to make it that long to be real I care about my half brother and we ve stayed close but I m really worried that not giving him money will end the relationship or turn him against me Even worse I know that he will very likely use that information to turn my entire dad s side of the family against me who some of them I do really like I just haven t had the opportunity to know them due to completely separate family drama At the same time I don t owe my half brother anything I am not responsible he and my dad s emotional instability Im not responsible for my dad having a one night stand and my half brother being completely unaccepting of the fact that his biological father for the most part wants nothing to do with him Alot of this is me venting but really I just want some outside opinions I really don t know how to handle this Is it even possible to have a relationship with my half brother while knowing the second I get an inheritance its either pay up or have him hate me for life Am I just delaying the inevitable Is it even possible to stay close to him TLDR I m the favorite kid stuck in the middle of a chaotic family My half brother expects inheritance money when my dad dies but I know giving him nothing could destroy our relationship and turn my distant family cousins aunts uncles whom I like against me Not sure if staying close is even possible without paying up",24,Male,son

text body: So I m 23f and my father is 53m Since I was a kid I have loved birthdays Even if it is something simple I like dressing up getting a nice cake making a cute back drop for pictures and also going out to eat dinner So it starts with my 19th birthday covid had just ended and 3 of my friends came home to surprise me All my family was also there My grandparents uncle aunt cousins But my father had gone out for some work I waited for him to cut my cake he didn t come back home Mom called him and told me he was busy And later I found out he was helping out his friend plan for his daughter s wedding menu I was very upset Cried a lot and didn t talk to him Then came my 20th I was already in university by then and just came home for my birthday It started nicely he got me a cake to cut at midnight I ordered a nice cake for the actual birthday And I told him I just want to go out for a dinner just the 4 of us My dad mom me and my little sister I like going to nice small restaurants because they serve nice food I don t like 5 stars or 7 stars because the food is bland and you can t talk loudly or enjoy They have classical music in the background which also I don t enjoy Still I let that go And them I find out he had invited his friends and business partners to surprise me mind you they are people I don t even like All I wanted was a quiet dinner with my family And in order to attend his guests we didn t even get to talk all the time I don t even have a picture of the 4 of us Now comes my 21st again because I love my birthday cakes I designed it myself ordered it And I got an idea my family was planning something So I gave them subtle hints about which people I would never want on my birthdays Again it started of nicely Even my bestfriend came home to wish me The thing they told me was that we will yo out for a family dinner my grandmother parents my uncles family me my sister and my elder cousin When we reach at the location it s a huge party With all of my fathers side of the family his friends and business partners and also the people I told them I don t like And none of my friends was invited One of them I know has tried to touch me and my sister and looks at my mom weirdly I had told my father this but he didn t listen to me And still invited him Again it was a huge party so it didn t affect me that much But here it comes I looked at my birthday cake it was beautiful I click pictures with it And when I go to cit my cake this girl around 7 to 8 years old the relative of that same guy whom he brought with himself without being invited Holds the knife and wants to cut the cake I look at my father and he is like let it be I get really upset and just leave to see the only relative from my mom s side of the family who had just arrived And later he scolded me for over reacting and leaving from there He said that she was just a child and if he asked that child to move away it could have made the man unhappy and he wouldn t risk his relationship with that guy for a cake But it was a big deal for me Then comes my 22nd birthday the worst of all of these I made a sketch of the cake I wanted And I was going to order it but my father told me that he will do it this time I was not feeling good about it but I let him because he does not like being told no He called me a day before and asked me what I want to do and who I want there I told him about a new place that had opened up and I like it And just our family and one of my cousins family there The place I liked was a roof top cafe which had a nice vibe and good music I especially told him that I did not want to go to a fine dine five star hotel I was having a very bad day because my best friend had not wished me and was feeling very sad We leave home he picks up the cake at the last moment and takes a long time there We reach and it s a five star hotel and again other than the cousins family there are two other families who I don t even know I was having a bad day and I start getting upset It was again the classical music and bland food So he starts telling my uncle that I am so ungrateful And how he does so much for me but I never appreciate him Mind you I always appreciated his efforts even if I didn t like it And then comes the breaking point I wanted to take pictures of the cake for my instagram and I open the box and it was a random cake Mind you didn t even have my name on it Not even the flavor I told him I don t know what happened I started breaking down and I leave the table quietly and ho to the washroom and cry My cousins and my sister follow me And later I cut that cake just so that the others don t feel bad He didn t even give me an explanation for why he did that Coming to my 23rd I decorated my room myself ordered my cake and just asked my parents to come home before 12 as my sister was at her university and I would be alone at home They went out to celebrate a friend s birthday They don t come home until 1 o clock in the night and I was alone And just because I told him that he always finds a way to spoil my birthdays and that he can never even do the bare minimum he got upset and didn t even wish me Although he did post on social media To show people what a doting father he is All I had previously asked was a bouquet of my favorite flowers and he didn t get them for me I spent the whole day crying in between the calls I got from my family and friends and trying to sound normal so that no one gets to know I m upset I didn t even get a hug from my parents that day I travel for my birthday every year for 8 hours to come home And that s what I get My mom tries her best she takes me to the salon gets me cloths gets my nails done But she never speaks against my dad I m tired of this I was once the girl who loved birthdays and now I hate them I just want to know if I am in the wrong Am I behaving like a brat Am I the AH",23,Female,Daughter

text body: I started looking after my grandparents old weekend mountain farmhouse after they both could no longer drive and were struggling with mobility issues and dementia for my grandfather I loved the house ever since I was a kid and I was really so happy there I loved the area and community too However some of my family members my dad and uncles didn t always take kindly to my being there and wanting to settle in there They d always tell me things like it s not your house and I always told them to never say that to me again That never left a good taste in my mouth because while I understand I didn t technically own the place I was one of the family members and trying to carry on the tradition They d always say we have professionals doing those things rather than thanking me I was doing it for free We all had over 20 years of fond memories there My dad eventually came around about me someday inheriting it and settling there longterm However some of my uncles still weren t convinced One of them once asked me would you be open to moving to your own place up here And I told him no because the whole point of me being there was to be in THAT house and it would ruin it all Once again he pulled the not your house card I also added a couple of instruments there being a musician and he was PISSED at me for this He was telling me how appalled my grandfather would be etc Within the last year or so my dad uncles started making many changes to the place that were really starting to take away its character I didn t like this and eventually I said I ve had enough I figured with the rate things were going in 5 years the place would be barely recognizable At this point I think it may be better to sell the place honestly Oh and BTW my grandmother LOVED that I was up there living in the place for a time and later checking in on it since she s no longer able to do so They always told me I was being bitchy when I d ask them not to tell me it wasn t my home That s not bitchy that s standing up for myself Did I act too entitled for thinking it was the perfect place for me due to the family ties and all the years of memories And I went up there and checked in on the place when NO ONE else in the family even offered to",,,

text body: Let me start by saying that I d love my mom s and my relationship to be like we re best friends but her behaviour is driving me up a wall and is in my opinion the factor that makes that sort of relationship impossible Of course she might say that my behaviour is worse but then she s not the one making this post I feel like my mom treats me like a child or like a dummy all the time It s not a weird childish voice that she does like I ve read other OP s moms do but more the things that she says For example constantly asking if I ve done something really obvious like have you switched the kettle off or have you closed the fridge door or put your alarm on you ll oversleep I haven t overslept anything for at least 15 years It s always something stupid that a person would need to be an absolute colosal idiot to not do as part of the normal functioning and it is constant Now everyone has brain farts that s normal but on the whole I don t consider myself to be stupid I ve always had excellent grades finished university been fully independent since then moved to another country made a carreer bought a house from my own money etc so pretty normal functioning adult with a brain Yet the way she talks to me is as if I was with a mental handicap and required her constant assistant or guidance the things she d say are to me the equivalent of telling a 31 year old to for example not eat dirt When I ask her to stop talking to me like I m an idiot she goes off on her tangent starting to cry shout and wail how it s impossible to say anything to you you always act like a wild animal jumping on me it s your own problems and your insecurities if you re thinking that I m talking to your like you re an idiot bwaaahahwaaa you need to go to therapy I will not talk to you at all then that s it that s the last time I say anything to you etc Then she does a massive guilt trip by being sulky for the rest of the day until I FEEL GUILTY that MY feelings were hurt and I expressed them and I NEED to apologise to her in order for normal relationship to resume But then there s also an aspect of my physical appearance Now my mom has been cheated on by my dad so many times throughout their married life and me being the only child and a daughter I feel like there was always some sort of resentment coming from her towards me and my relationship with my dad which I d call normal nothing excessive or very close God forbid I d call my dad first then her I d listen to a rant about how father is always more important to you of course you don t need to call your mother only father is in front of your eyes This of course would then lead me to say Of course not mom I love both of you lalala There were periods in my life where she s be insisting for me to cut my hair off because long hair is ugly on me and looks like spaghetti she s had a pixie cut all her life Or she d tell me at 8AM to stop eating this is why you re fat because you stuff everything into your mouth Now this was said after I threw a sweet one into my mouth first thing in the morning She s incredibly patronising always offers unsolicited advice I regret to say that there was never a situation where I genuinely needed her advice and felt that she could truly offer one and then when I respond that this is not what I will do he comes back with of course your mother is an idiot she doesn t have any experience why should you listen to me I will not say anything to you go to your father for advice then or do what you think you know best This rant would always be in a bitter tone never in a normal ok gotcha sort of tone Part of that appearance issue is her giving compliments It s either nothing or incredibly pushy rant for me to buy put on something she suggested or a back handed compliment like oh you look no nice I love this on you followed closely by It s good you changed your looks a bit I was already bored of green colour on you Or she d buy me a clothing item despite my very explicit repeated instruction to NEVER buy me clothes the item would be in a most ridiculous green seen to man and she d be like but you love green despite the fact that she s never once in my life seen me wear that shade of green And the list goes onnnnn and onnnn I don t know what to say or not to say to her anymore but my resentment is now on such a level that I m seriously considering going to therapy and getting a journal despite the fact that I ve never had one in my life",31,Female,daughter

author: Responsible_Bake3941
text body: I 22 F and my fiancé 24 M just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that Since the very beginning of our relationship it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother 62 F Now it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding Let me explain After my now fiancé and I began dating I began to tell my mom about him since I was obviously excited about this new relationship Some of her biggest gripes were that he s nothing more in her mind than a backwoods redneck and essentially that I m too good for him But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long time Jehovah s Witnesses Ever since I told her this she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had Example A She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up I told her no it really wasn t his thing and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork construction that he does now and never took much of an interest in sports She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn t done any sports since he couldn t do anything that would put him around being people that weren t JW I know this is true within the religion but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young I ve tried to explain this as not true but she simply won t accept it Example B I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in After dating for almost a year I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living Ever since I ve moved and especially after I told her about our engagement all she does is say that I ve been sucked in She s convinced I m in a cult She s also said she hates my ex boyfriend who cheated on me to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him Example C Since starting working post college I ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into fundraising and I haven t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before I ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home since I have learned that cleaning cooking and decorating are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall She says I m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from even after I had said many times I didn t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new and find a nice boy down there to settle down with Example D Since announcing our engagement she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare When I told her our initial wedding date she asked why we were rushing it I told her we just didn t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married She grilled me and said I must be pregnant and what happened to having a long engagement She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and or borderline personality disorder She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer we live 4 5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up she told me it was already too late this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating She s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family When we weren t speaking a couple months back she didn t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because I didn t ask how the dog was I never got a chance to say goodbye Before this she had previously called me at 12 30 am after we hadn t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent 10 000 at the casino Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should ve never asked All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself our relationship as he calls it When I told my mother the date she said it was too soon and that she didn t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn t help me with the wedding I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would and she said yes I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors While this was true after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship Ever since we ve been arguing pretty consistently The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement He s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I m in But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I m going to be loyal to him not to my mom The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some and he s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to since it is a small town here My in laws are absolutely incredible and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom We often go out to lunch together and just spend a lot of time together overall Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing My mom is my only family since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn t close with any of her siblings and all my grandparents are gone I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else How do I prove myself to my fiancé How do I stick up to my mother and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her Can I salvage a relationship with both of them My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me like being the parent that stayed when my dad left But I also love my fiancé more than anything and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us He s said he s just been in a down mood in general he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness I ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings Thank you in advance for any advice",22,Female,daughter

text body: Me and my brother are in a conflict dispute with my older sister with the care of our father who is 79 years old and lives here in Ontario Canada My sister married an American and lives in the U S Our father is still physically ok with mobility and some self care but has been declining with dementia and has already failed a cognitive assessment test He cannot drive or cook anymore like he use to He is not safe to live by himself He has a very good pension and large savings in the bank Me and my brother want him to live in an assisted living or a nursing home setting but my sister doesn t agree because it would only deteriorate him She wants him to live with me My dad also expects me and my brother to take care of him because he said it s the law He is also self entitled The problem is me and my wife work full time My brother also works Me and my wife won t have the time and energy to take care of him full time He won t get the proper care When dad is in my house he is obnoxiously rude and stubborn He expects us to do everything for him He doesn t respect the rules of the house He urinates in his room using a cup while the washroom is just beside his room Almost acts like a child The washroom is extremely dirty when he does use it He doesn t talk to me at all like any normal father would like how s your day and I have to initiate the conversation We cook and feed him 3 times a day and we don t ask him for money I thought an aging father would be wise and pass some wisdom but that isn t the case with him he s miserable and gotten worse He doesn t respect our boundaries It is emotionally and physically draining and we don t have the capacity to care for him I told my sister if she doesn t want him in a nursing home then she should take care of him and live with her in the U S because my dad also has a green card My dad divorced his 2nd ex wife who was American My sister said that can t happen because her lifestyle doesn t fit my dad s lifestyle She quit her career to be a full time mom Instead my sister wants him to live with me and hire home care while me and my wife are away at work My wife said absolutely no way She said she will divorce me if it ever happens It would completely change our life So this is the issue we re having right now is what to do with dad s living situation Here is a little background Me and my brother had an unpleasant experience growing up and suffered severe emotional neglect and physical abuse from our father when we were younger Our narcissistic sister also treated us the same I asked my father why he did this for closure My father denied it ever happened I had to show him the marks on my arms that it did happen and told him the different torture techniques he used on me and my brother My father also financially supported my sister all her life gifted her a car renting her an apartment while she was in university and graduated My father would pay for her trips to travel abroad My sister never thought of repaying my father with any token of appreciation She told me a gift is not meant to be repaid It was the opposite for me and my brother My father never took us to travel or buy us anything to have fun I would be jealous of the other kids because they would be enjoying playing video games wearing nice shoes and coming back from vacations during March break I started working part time when I was 17 to support myself My dad was strict with giving me money We weren t allowed to even borrow the car to go to school which was a 2 hour bus ride each way I eventually quit college because I couldn t keep up and lost focus and had no guidance I started hanging out and coming home late so my dad kicked me out of the house That s when I met my wife and took me in to live with her family and supported me while I eventually went back to school years later to finish a degree and have a successful career I ve already forgiven my dad and I ve accepted him for who he is not expecting change and letting him live his own way in peace but at the same time I also need to honor myself and my own right to live in peace I suggested to have a family mediator service help and settle our differences with planning dad s care My sister was hesitant at first to use one but finally agreed but she said we would use the one she knows from her area My question is am I obligated to care for my father",,,son

text body: I cannot stand my F19 younger brother M17 For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers F46 mental illness and various crises she s experiences and our fathers M52 general absence We don t have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me To be clear my brother I ll call X for simplicity has no known mental illnesses disabilities or other issues that would delay mental emotional development I have been diagnosed with GAD OCD and depression My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house For context My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard all while doing nothing to assist So this being the situation it was expected that the kids being me and X would clean the house However for no known reason except X s own selfishness and presumed laziness the chores would fall to me If the house was not kept to a certain and often unknown standard I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment I say no known because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X Following suit as we ve grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me My mother being in her free girl and spiritual era has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about Being that I have OCD one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough I am also in my third year of University currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85 I have explained to both my mom and X I don t bother with my dad because he s not in the picture right not how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes Earlier today the event that prompted me to write this I was at work Around 11 30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse Typically when I message him he won t respond so he can claim he didn t see the text At 11 50 I messaged him again reminding him of what was asked I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded I asked him kindly again to unload the dished He told me to fuck off This is not the first time this has happened I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house To be clear this kid has school from 9 11 having a third period spare meaning he has a 2 hour lunch He is in grade 12 or a senior we are from Canada When I was in grade 12 I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework He sits of the couch and either a sleeps or b plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans not sure if that s what its called I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called self centred and from my mom I get a I will talk to him or a lay off of him In my opinion nothing has changed I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues which she fucking knew about and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me This job was also 30 minutes away from my house I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time it felt like the end of the world So far X has looked for two jobs One being at the end of his grade 11 year this one was promised to him but fell through and is my moms words disappointed him and makes him not want to try again and then again recently dropping his resume off at a dollarama It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school keeping my grades above a 95 average I know it was only high school however it still took quite a bit of time and energy working around 25 hours a week and keeping the house clean He has no job is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes and has no responsibilities around the house My second issue is his choice of words He often uses slurs such as the r n f I the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada and many more He is a cis het white male for any context While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities it is still incredibly harmful I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world He is unfortunately falling down the alt right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it He consistently refers to me and my mom as bitches and to me as a fat fuck or a slut whore Again words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now let alone when I was 17 I would be screamed at My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep Since I was in grade 4 I have been getting myself X and my mom up in time for school My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up feed the pets Dogs and cats let them out to play make mine and X s lunch for the day make myself breakfast X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up We are out the door by 8 25am As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day Thankfully as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something I still hate being late let the record be known However I have not been in Gen Ed for nearly 3 years now and still have to wake X up My mom thankfully has gotten better however she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession beginning the process of waking him up at 7 30 to give him an extra half hour pulling the blankets off him spraying him with water which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist yelling and using a very loud alarm Nothing works He never wakes up I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5 30am I am so fucking tired I don t even know what to do I don t know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop I don t know how much I can take of this anymore I just want to be a kid and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can t keep doing this",19,Female,sibling

author: maureen1231
text body: Sunday is Mother s Day For those lucky enough to still be able to celebrate with their mothers consider bestowing an eternal gift help her write her life story for posterity I just read a great article on the difference between people who actively try to direct events in their own lives versus people who are more passive When it comes to asking parents to answer questions and write their life stories this situation often occurs Some take action to get answers to questions while their parents are still able Others inadvertently let the clock run out and then experience overwhelming regret Relationships between parents and children can be complex Some women for example are reluctant to consider writing their life stories because they believe their families are not interested and that they have nothing out of the ordinary to say But surveys repeatedly show that families want more information about the lives of their parents and grandparents In one survey adult kids said they want to know more about the early lives of their parents while moms said they would be glad to share their experiences but they thought their kids were not interested because they never asked On the eve of Mother s Day you can change the dynamic by showing your mom that you actually want her to write her story Since it is clearly important that she feel her loved ones actually want a written life story tell her you do Show her the Decade by Decade Method a simple way in which she answers questions pertaining to each decade of her life Print out the post for the first decade so that she has a clear idea of what is involved In addition pledge your willingness to meet regularly such as weekly to read the questions for each decade as she writes her answers This process will naturally allow you to get answers to all of your questions even the ones you didn t know you had Select a mutually agreeable day and time to start as a way of showing your commitment to get together until the draft is complete At the end of the process have copies bound for each family member Make sure she knows her family will cherish the book forever Helping your mom write her life story for posterity is the best Mother s Day gift ever",,,
776,What is my dad doing with his money !?!?,"title: What is my dad doing with his money !?!?
author: 
text body: I F19 just really got the grasp of how much of a loser my dad 59 is It first started when I was in the 4th grade he moved to the US so I could have a better life I was born and raised in Spain I m mixed with Ecuadorian from mom and Cuban from dad but I moved to the US when I started 7th grade He missed a lot of my crucial moments ages because he was working the whole time yet he doesn t have any money or own anything to his name He always gave me this stupid excuse of how he s been working hard this whole time so I can have a better life yet I don t see any of the money or efforts that he so desperately worked for IDK WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS MONEY BRUH Since I m the youngest out of my 4 siblings all of them are adults I was the only one that moved here to the US along with my mom 57 It put a lot of pressure on me over the years since I m the only one that knows Spanish English fluently I was 12 y o already translating important documents that a kid shouldn t even be doing I always had to translate help for my parents for ANYTHING and there was not a single moment where I actually enjoyed or had the time to enjoy regular teenage girl things because of them and because of that I developed a lot of stress early in my life I don t really blame my mom for anything because she was the one who basically raised me by herself and she didn t want this life or misery my dad is really hard on her My problem really is with my dad he s a man child that doesn t know how to control his emotions talking to him feels so pointless I ve expressed how I feel about him multiple times but it feels like I m talking to a wall He always used to put out his anger on me like I was his emotional toy to use this changed overtime as I grew older because I didn t wanna put up with it anymore but now he s doing the same thing to my mom He always talks about the same things how his arms body hurt and how he s miserable because he s working on a different state and his not with us mind you he works out of state so he only comes home max twice every month for like a week how he barely has any money he owes money to people yet he chooses to have that life He s always talking about the same damn things and it s never anything different he always gets mad when I tell him I don t want to hear any of his miserable bullshit because it doesn t make me feel good at all I ve grown to be very anxious because of him I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells because as soon as something doesn t go his way he starts exploding and he has to make his problems everybody s problems Lately he s been demanding that I start paying rent because the financial situation is tight My cousin from his side recently moved to my house with her husband and son because they immigrated from Cuba to the US and they didn t have anyone to receive them First of all he didn t even consult me or my mom to see if we were fine with them moving to our house he just brought them home without saying anything I don t have anything against them but it s still very annoying Second of all because of them we have been spending more money on the bills and food so now he s demanding that I help pay rent along with my cousin and her husband I wouldn t mind helping if it wasn t for the fact that he gets payed weekly twice more than me but somehow he never has any fucking money I ve been planning on moving out soon with my boyfriend 20 because I can t stand this situation anymore but it s very hard for me to move out considering that I have to give him 400 out of my check I still have leftover money but there s stuff that I also pay on my own so I basically don t really have a lot of money left He always talks about himself and how miserable he is I hate having to even call him because he s always talking about the same shit and as soon as I talk about something regarding myself he somehow manages to switch it up on poor him ALWAYS I m just very frustrated and angry at this point because he s embarrassed me and done said a lot of horrible things to me but he acts like he never did I love my dad very much but I m really starting to resent him as the days go on Every time he comes home the vibe always changes everyone notices his horrible energy so everyone has to walk on eggshells every time he s home I hate when he gets home because he s always complaining about how hard his life is but he never wants to do anything about it he loves complaining to everyone and I m FED UP I really would appreciate any advice or help because I m at the point where I just wanna go in a corner and cry I feel like I can never have a good relationship with him because he s never really been involved with my life and now it s too late I feel very awkward and tense around him I don t even feel like I m his daughter I feel like I m some type of secretary or helper because he s always relying on me for almost everything like he is hopeless if I don t help him He has done a lot more horrible things but this is a basic summary of everything He is hopeless and I m not going to be here for any longer to tolerate his misery My problem now is that I don t know how to control cope with this anxiousness stress and also on how to control the way I feel because as soon as my dad does say something it s like my whole mood changes and I feel shitty I know that the cause is my dad but it feels so hard to control it and I haven t really had any luck with it I ve been coping with smoking but it s been about 3 yrs or so and I m tired of this cycle I feel very lost",19,Female,daughter

text body: I m the oldest of both my parent s kids being a m20 about to turn 21 I have half brothers and sisters on both my dad and mom s side My issue is with my mom s side which is who I live with while being home from college My household contains my step dad my mom my younger sister who is in 3rd grade and my younger brother Ever since my mom has started this new family I can t help but feeling more and more excluded and left out As well being treated differently than the other two kids To keep the story short my other siblings within the home are aloud to get away with just about anything Examples cussing my mom and my step dad out calling them everything under the sun even slurs without being checked or punished As well as being able to slam doors make highly inappropriate noises making inappropriate jokes or talking about sex and so much more Like so bad that my younger sister who I don t even think was in kindergarten yet split my grandmas head open with a miniature shovel for gardening and when my grandma was crying and stuff my mom and sister were laughing and making fun of her They also let the kids disrespect whoever they want as well including elders Now where I come in is that I wouldn t be allowed to get away or do any of this even if I tried When I even bring up some that concerns me my mom flips out and starts screaming and literally goes crazy It s even gotten so bad that my step dad has put his hands on my twice and one time leaving bruises due to me being upset because they let their new dog chew up some that I specifically told them to watch out for But when I got mad my mom got up into my face and so did my step dad with his finger which lead to me pushing it away which in turn lead to the me getting bruises I also have no sort of privacy because ever since my younger sister has well be able to walk ig she purposefully bugs and does stuff to get on my nerves or to be weird She s watched me sleep several times has peeped and opened the door to the bathroom when I was using the bathroom or getting into the shower fyi the bathroom door to our house has never had a lock on it peaked under my door when I ve had significant others over and so much more The most recent time being today just an hour ago when I went to use the bathroom I took a second to piss due to being a nervous when peeing and I immediately hear through the next room my sister giving my mom a run down of what I looked like using the bathroom and etc with my mom asking details and further intriguing the conversation When I was only in the bathroom for less than 2 mins at that point This happens very often and idk what to do at the point because I do not even feel comfortable or safe doing anything in this house without feeling watched or checked up on because both my siblings and parents constantly ask me what I m doing or what I m eating And if I m eating I m called a fat ass or etc other aspects to this is that I have Asperger s syndrome and have been diagnosed with depression serve anxiety as well as ibs which can make using the bathroom very difficult Can I have some advice on what to do in this situation P s sorry if I m all over the place my blood is boiling and I just feel very embarrassed and ashamed I can provide more details if needed also double p s but I m 20 years old and I still have not gotten my license or have had a job not for a lack of trying but every time I do some happens or comes up that my mom talks me out of doing it or makes it to where I can t do it or attend",20,,oldest child

abundantly clear to him at the time he was making a mistake My opinion was based on the story he told me where they had been playing the same poker machine but before he moved to live with her permanently He put in 50 and they played that out She put in 50 and they won a 5 000 jackpot She said it s all hers because it was her 50 that the jackpot was won on He had to explain it s both their money and she eventually begrudgingly handed over half the money At the time I told him if that was me playing the pokies with her I would have gotten my money and then shook her hand and wished her all the best for the rest of her life and walked away and I don t understand why he hasn t done the same thing because what she did is a major personality flaw When they broke up I didn t do a I told you so I helped out by buying him furniture as all the furniture in their place was all hers before they met I also gave him a couple of thousand to make sure he wasn t going to be stressing over money at what was obviously a stressful time So back to the birthday lunch with my two other adult children I was sharing the story of how renters in my Strata complex were recently evicted because they were constantly parking their car in contravention of by laws blocking other residents access to their garages Threatening violence when they were asked to move their vehicles I m on the strata committee and sometimes accompanied other residents to the renters premises a few times as support and to be a witness to any threats of violence or actual violence I was saying how they tried staunching up on me a couple of times and how but I bailing them up individually later some times days and weeks later in secluded parts of the complex and invited them to do what they had threatened but they would never follow through with their threats and claiming they never made them it was someone else in the house I d end the various confrontations that if the threats are made again There will be real word physical consequences for them Long story short we were on the verge of taking them to the NSW Tribunal and the owner who is not active on the committee got wind of what was happening How he never knew from the very first letter sent to his managing Real Estate s office we have no idea He went on an inspection with the Managing agent and told them to stop what they were doing They told him to fuck off and made threats So he issued them an eviction the next day saving us from using Strata fees My daughter then said in a sarcastic manner Oh you re always so tough that s your answer for everything referring to me bailing people up and asking them to follow through on their threats of violence I asked her what that means She then said that when I had a new fence installed a few years earlier and the job was terrible and I insisted on the contractor returning and fixing their horrible work and when the contractor turned up I went out to fight him I had to remind her that she was there and we both overheard him telling his workers how he s going to bash me if I come out of the house and of course I went out of the house and told him Here I am He did nothing acting puzzled as to why I was there announcing my presence I told him what I d heard He then said he can t work under those conditions left in his work vehicle I then explained that s how I learnt from a very young age to deal with bullies confront them and it s been my experience that they turn to water To do anything less is to invite repeated bullying from them and that s something I ll never accept During that same lunch I found out that my eldest son is on leave from work for 3 weeks but he s staying home As a joke I said Oh my I have a million things for you to do at my home I could fill up the rest of your holidays with work from sun up to sun down but we ll start easy with a 9am start on Monday with some roof work as there are some dead tree branches over hanging the roof which need cutting down So I ll see you then which would be wonderful I expected my tone was jovial enough to show it was an obvious joke I don t actually have anything for him to do as all external work at my home is carried out on the Strata complex s coin He knows that He owns and lives in a block of units He said You ll have to pay me I frowned got serious and said You re joking right He said No I said that s not how it works with family He said it s going to cost him money to drive and stuff I said to leave it because we re just going to argue I was looking at him and thinking that s not my son he should take a long hard look at himself and his values because I don t know where he go the idea that to help family you get paid Anyway the conversations at the birthday lunch has made me question the relationship with those two adult children If they were just friends I d be having a stern conversation with my daughter about misrepresenting me as the instigator of the confrontation with the Fencer and insisting on an apology or a see you later enjoy the rest of your life As for my son Where and how he came to have such a putrid attitude I have no idea and am ashamed he thinks like that If he was merely a friend I don t think I d be making any more efforts to maintain the relationship For me Family and friends should never hesitate in asking and receiving help It s an automatic thing as far as I m concerned Am I over reacting",,,parent

author: Illustrious_Tap_1344
text body: Long read I m sorry My eldest has baseball practice every Mon Wed and Fri with games on Sat I bring my other 3 kids to the playground right next to baseball field to play sometimes while oldest is at practice There s all kinds of kids there playing from the other baseball families but none of the parents watch them I m usually the only parent watching my kids All the baseball moms are kinda friends and hangout together during practice a lil unwelcoming to me Not sure why There has been brother sister siblings that usually bully or pick on my children the 6 7 yr old boy we will call Josh has previously kicked my sons feet out from under him causing him to fall on his back I scolded him and told him that it was not nice or kind and if someone did it to him how would he feel and the 4 5yr old girl we ll call trudy tells my girls if they dont do what she says like being mean to other kids or excluding them they aren t her friends has called another friend of ours the n word doesn t listen to the word no But since we re all at baseball it s hard to avoid not playing with Trudy sometimes and they are just kids I also try to teach my children that we all make poor decisions sometimes and forgiveness etc There was an incident one evening that another girl spit in Trudys hair at the playground Trudy went crying to baseball moms nothing of it So today at the baseball game My daughters went off to ride their scooters one came back and said Trudy and another girl we will call May threw dry dog poop at her face So I went and investigated no parents around I asked May if she did it she told the truth but she said Trudy told me to I communicated calmly why would you listen to her and get in trouble for it she apologized and that was it I asked Trudy why she thought it was ok to throw poop at my daughter and she immediately started crying loud I told her she wasn t in trouble and if someone threw poop at her id do the same thing I asked her if she wanted to apologize and her lips locked and she started crying more I told them we can still be friends we all make mistakes and we should take care of each other I turned around and started walking off to our spot where we were watching the game Mays father passes me and I realize it s her father so I respectfully let him know his daughter threw dry dog poop at my daughter and she was truthful and apologized nothing of it May stays away from my kids Trudy continues to interact We try to let our children make their minds up for themselves about other people so we aren t banning them from playing with Trudy They continue to play Near the end of game my son informs me that Josh Trudys brother was throwing rocks and baseballs at his face while Im walking to the bathroom i walk out At this moment Trudy pushes my daughter off a picnic table she was sitting at waiting for me to come out of the bathroom and Josh right next to her So once again I tell Trudy don t you do that to her it is not nice what if you got pushed off the picnic table and she locks up and starts wailing loud And I tell Josh it was not nice that he was throwing rocks at my sons face While this is happening Mays mom the girl that threw poop at my daughter walks up and hotly asks what s going on because she heard Trudy crying I told her she pushed my daughter off the table and I scolded her Mays mom says I already scolded them I ask My kids She says all the kids I tell her this just happened and Josh is throwing rocks at my sons face Josh interjecting says she was screaming at Trudy I reply I was not screaming I scolded her and reiterated what I had said to Trudy Mays mom says angrily you should talk to the parents first I reply where are her parents Her moms not here and her dad is in the field which is all true and I didn t think she thought I d know all that but I m very observant At this point Mays mom is visibly upset that I m even trying to make this a discussion and did not instantly submit to her I did scold her daughter for throwing poop at my child We start to pack up and I hear Josh tell his dad that s her the one that screamed at us I could tell he was stalling to not have to have a conversation hoping we would just leave first My daughter left her scooter near the bathroom as I m walking to grab it Mays mom is staring me down I make eye contact to acknowledge that I can see her staring at me and carry on with my conversation with my daughter But oh I can tell she s fuming from the way she s puffing on her cigarette Josh and Trudy s dad is passing me so I let him know Respectfully I scolded your kids And Mays mom said I should talk to the parents but her moms not here he scoffed when I said that part and you were in the field so I scolded them He asked what they did I told him I also told him about the previous incident we had of him tripping my son at the park He asked his son And he said he did throw balls at my sons face but not rocks I don t believe him my children rarely ever lie we don t punish for telling the truth even if it was a poor decision Then I told him that Trudy pushed my daughter off the table He said well I heard they spit in her hair now these parents who aren t watching their kids are all talking about what they think my kids did I said my kids did not do that But if they were to ever please let me know or feel free to scold them I tell Josh if any one of my kids ever do something unkind come to me and we will deal with it together I tell dad feel free to let me know if I overstepped in any way I let him know who I am and he says I know I ve never met him before this moment so how What He tells me his name and I tell him thanks for the conversation I get back to the car and my eldest said that his team mates think his sisters spit in Trudys hair so now all the kids are in on this too What kind of gossip is going on here These kids are already using triangulation tactics And major manipulation it s concerning And I have to now feel uncomfortable around baseball events or walk in eggshells Why do I feel affected by this Should I done something differently",,,

text body: Yeah the title is strange sorry Hi Before I start I d like to say that I love my sister She s the only person I m not kidding in my family that I love But sometimes I HATE her and have a bad relationship with her To give you a bit of background me F 20 and my little sister 19 soon to be 20 in June we re not twins me 2005 her 2006 As kids we were super close really like best friends we cooked together played games watched movies But that all changed when she went back to high school and got a phone and maybe forty at the Covid I live with my relatively toxic mother another story my half sister whom I don t like but another story and my sister My father died in 2022 but I never really appreciated him Basically my relationship with my family is complex but that s not the topic for today Here s a list of behavior in my sister that I find problematic or even concerning She s locked in her room all day talking with her friends or being on tik tok She doesn t take care of her hygiene no shower doesn t take off her make up doesn t brush her teeth keeps her work uniform that smells of restaurant grease But her hygiene problem goes back a long way when she was 7 8 years old She doesn t clean her room her study desk is full with make up products there are cups of bubble tea and starbucks that are several days or even months old there are dirty plates everywhere clothes on the floor a very strong smell from the perfume and her uniform She doesn t understand sharing a common space the shower is overrun with her products BUT SHE DOESN T TAKE A SHOWER I just have three bottles soap shampoo conditioner She doesn t help with the household chores even if I m at college and I don t have the time and my mother is permanently injured work accident She gets angry for no reason my mother or I ask her to clean her room or do the housework I tell her nicely too when we encourage her to study she s in an adult school because she failed high school when we tell her to come home early or not to go out with her friends from Monday to Sunday or when we leave her door ajar just to ventilate her room because it stinks She s disorganized when I ask her to pick me up after school or work she s either an hour late or she s COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN She doesn t do her laundry she s either locked in her room or out with friends In connection with these outings she s bought herself a used car my family and I don t know where she s going with whom and we don t know when she ll be back which is worrying She gets off work or school 3 30 or 4 30 pm and comes home at 1 or 2 am Then she has the AUDACITY to be angry under the pretext of wanting to live her life LIKE GURL STF Sorry As for her car she doesn t take care of it It s dirty it stinks she drives it constantly as if it were new she doesn t want to look to see if everything s OK oil wiper fluid listen to weird noises etc She refuses to make a doctor s appointment She says she doesn t know what to do I didn t know at first either I just googled it She doesn t take care of herself and yet she s anemic but refuses to take a blood test I have to wait until she gets home before going to sleep 1am 2am I have to call her to tell her to come home which is clearly not my role She doesn t understand that there are reasonable times to come home She can be mean and cold to me whereas I m nice to her and I m constantly defending her in arguments with our mother Sometimes she suffers but refuses to talk about it She can be manipulative and it s me who comes across as the victim or slave of the house because I do everything for her and defend her all the time during arguments with the family She only eats junk food Before she destroyed my mother s car which was the ONLY CAR in the house an accident but nothing serious just the bumper which insurance companies say can t be repaired she refused to share it with me For example when she asks me to drop her off at work or school or when I pick her up she wants to drive like I M THE DRIVER I ve since stopped because it s not fair yk I understand that she wants to practice but my sister ALWAYS has the car I only touched that car 10 times before the accident Her driving terrifies me she plays the music so loudly that I can hear it through my sony earbuds wireless WHICH IS NOT NORMAL She drives super fast and zig zags on the freeway because cars drive slowly What s more her seat is positioned at a 120 degree angle HOW DO YOU DO YOUR BLIND SPOTS It takes her forever to pay me back Sometimes she forgets to pay her share of the phone bill we share a family plan together because it s cheaper She s ignorant she knows nothing about basic history or general knowledge of our world I tell her James Crow laws she doesn t know LIKE GIRL YOU ARE BLACK HOW She doesn t know the dates of the first and second world wars LIKE HOW I know she skipped a lot of classes but this is abusive Just to let you know I ABSOLUTELY don t understand who my sister is I don t know if this is normal for a little sister or not She can be nice and all but I think she abuses my kindness patience and generosity Sometimes I wonder if I should cut off all connection with her before I drown and she learns to be an adult I help her but I can t ALWAYS help her Like she has to be independent I know that everything may seem contradictory but this is my situation I just want to know if there are people who are going through something similar or would have any advice Thanks so much for reading and feel free to ask any questions Ps English is not my

text body: My birthday always falls within a few day s of Mother s Day sometimes it s actually on Mother s Day My family has started referring to this week as hell week for them I feel like I m a pretty low maintenance wife and mom when it comes to gifts and celebrations or anything involving me so it really hurts my feelings that they treat me like a burden every year I put a lot of effort into their birthdays and holiday experiences I do it because I love them and I don t expect this to be reciprocated in the same ways but I also don t expect to be treated like this Am I being sensitive for taking their comments to heart Maybe I should be realistic and realize this definitely happens to other people who have birthdays around holidays Sigh MomLife",,Female,mom

author: black4lt
text body: I saw a similar post within this subreddit but it was years ago so I suppose I want to open up the conversation once again As the title says I am a little worried for my families health Here is the thing growing up amidst my family we have had a bit of an unhealthy lifestyle diet It was what I have known since I was born It wasn t until the previous few years where I decided for myself that I wanted to become more healthy Granted it has taken me some trial error and experience to bring me to where I am now I have been living pretty much on my own for the past few years but now I am residing with my family for a bit Coming back I soon recognized our house s eating habits many of the things in the house I could not or would not eat Then on top of that take out and eating out makes up majority of their diets However it is not just their diets I am worried about For example my mother in her 50 s often has a hard time getting up or sitting in chairs due to her weight Often times me or my brother would have to help her up We are at an age where we both are probably going to move out soon when we aren t here I worry how it would be for her to get around when she already struggles People make their own choices for their lives and don t make changes unless they really want it for themselves I get that I have lived it However I also see the health problems that have arisen within my family as well High blood pressure diabetes arthritis joint pain I worry about their longevity If I have kids one day I would like for them to meet their grandchildren and be part of their lives If I get married one day I would like for them to be present for that moment For accomplishments and opportunities I want to be able to share those experiences with them for as much as I can So I worry for their health and ability to get through life as we both get older If nothing changes then these problems are just going to become worse Another thing to mention amidst my journey towards prioritizing health I have lost a good bit of weight I really don t want to seem like that one nagging person who loses weight and comments on other peoples lives Like good for me but other peoples life is their life However I often think about if there is a way I could bring up my concerns with my family about this Within my journey if I had some better help guidance and compassion instead of all the trial and error I ran into things would have been so much easier I suppose I am trying my best to lead by example as well but I m not really seeing any effect from that either Has anyone else been in this position Could you share your experience maybe some advice",,,

text body: I m a 39 year old single male and only child And because I m a single male I don t really have people to travel on vacation with I ve traveled solo a few times but my parents try to stop me by telling me to travel with them as a family instead of going solo But the last couple of times I ve traveled with my parents it s frustrating and annoying They are disorganized they get lost easily and they are always indecisive about where to eat and sometimes I m going hungry on the trip And on top of that they refuse to accept help from me because they feel they know it all so I m constantly walking with them and getting lost and I just have to tag along with the nonsense As pathetic as it may seem when I travel solo I have an amazing time But with my parents it s torture I know I should try to appreciate my parents while they are still around but it s very difficult dealing with their lack of organization and them looking at me as a kid refusing to accept help and guidance from me And I m sorry if my frustration makes me a bad person I try very hard to go away with them and be as patient as possible but it s too hard I m just so used to having everything planned ahead and organized when I m traveling solo so I cannot tolerate the mess of a vacation that my parents put together Is it just me or does anyone else have this experience when traveling on vacation with your parents as an adult And do you think it s better that I travel solo going forward even tho it s a bit pathetic to do so TL DR As a 39 year old adult male it s very hard traveling on vacation with my parents as they are very disorganized and they don t plan ahead They get lost easily on where they are going and what to do and they refuse to accept guidance and help from me As a result my vacation ends up being a disaster When I travel solo on my own and plan ahead I always have a good time surprisingly Does anyone else have this same issue",39,Male,Only child

text body: Hey all I have recently had a falling out with my mother and it s something that I have been very vigilant and observant about but also bit my tongue on for quite some time Only recently have I lost my cool with her which led to a falling out between her and myself When I come over to see my Mom she works from home in the living room during her working hours within weekdays we are neighbours as I live one second away from her home even when she s not busy and free away from calls and meetings within her working hours which most of the time that s the case for her so she s chilling anyway she either invites me in into her house or I will ring on her door to see if she s alright and just check in really and instead of being an active listener and showing interest in our conversation she immediately walks away and starts cleaning hoovering doing something without showing her face but of course she continues to drag the conversation by shouting over the rooms in her house as that s her way of communicating directly at me that she is willing to listen She then proceeds to go into the kitchen and I have to raise my voice so she can hear me In all honesty it sounds a bit daft but it feels like I am speaking to her ghost or the wall Not very respectful I think And this is something that doesn t just happen with me but also with my grandmother since she and I share our home and she also deals with a similar situation My mother and I can t speak on her behalf seems to be always busy and always on the go but it can get out of hand especially when you want to chill out with her and spend some quality family time even when it s already been planned and is happening in the moment My mother was also very absent when I was born she was extremely busy and away from the country due to her work demands and responsibilities My father got up and went to the store to get some milk ygm and raising me was left to my grandparents my mother s parents So again my mother was out of the picture for some time She was only there temporarily like blips in my memory banks and then she d go elsewhere One example here is I took my Mom out for a coffee in a nice fancy 5 star hotel restaurant a few months back Within about sitting for roughly 15 minutes or so my mother goes to me Drink up we have to get going and I look at my watch and tell her What s the rush Have you got to be someplace somewhere now and she reponds No and goes silent I have tried to tell her she has got to switch off because it seems like she s in a constant rush 24 7 and then struggles to deal with stress management and her stuff I guess that s how her mind works and each to their own but it feels sometimes very cold to just get to know her on a deeper level and spend some time with her mother to son I m 23 and she s 45 so she s relatively a young mother but even then when she isn t working or doing something that s in her diary schedule or agenda for the day she seems to be always caught up in something or be aggressively interested in tackling another task out of thin air which hasn t been spoken about for instance she s extremely impulsive with decision making on the spot and each decision is always met with this whooosh of aggression and IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW kind of attitude if you get me She likes to be hard working even when the time isn t there but it s hard to socialize and bond with her My late grandfather my mom s father when he was alive also had a very similar mindset and attitude as my mother only he was more rational and sensible sometimes I know my grandfather spent a lot of time with my mom whilst she was growing up which might have had an impact on her personality in her later years since he raised her more as a son than a daughter and maybe this is my mothers internal everlasting grievance towards him by her adapting her personality and attitude in life to him she even tells me and my grandmother when she does things for example it s what he d do like trying to be a reincarnation or second version of him or something which further escalates into situations like these where my mother isn t being very motherly and it s very hard to bond and spend time with her Anyway so a couple of days ago I had a small crashout of sorts by acting the same way and mirroring her behavior back towards her when she came over to my house this time to see my grandmother and she then had a go at me and started asking me What s wrong where I simply said I m just acting and behaving the way you do because I ve had enough and I walked away She of course was taken back by this and retaliated by talking to herself and she walked off and left the house That was the last time we spoke Apologies for this long winded story but I just don t know what I should do Am I being the A hole here or is she in the wrong Do I reach out to her first and apologize or do I wait for her to come around and sit down with me Who reaches out first to whom and breaks the ice",23,Male,son

text body: Hello My name is Claire and I m 86 years old I ve been thinking a lot about my kids and my family So I wanna talk about my life with them I was born May 24 1938 in Pennsylvania to my parents Charles and Catherine My dad was a WWI Veteran My parents married in 1929 I had a infant brother who died in 1930 I had one brother and one sister growing up Mabel and Bobby I was closest with Mabel but Bobby just went to work and misbehaved My mom would cheat on my dad after I was born so she was never home And my dad was very very sick Me in my youth I started fighting constantly with my sister and sneaking out of the house when dad put me to bed to drink and smoke I was 16 at this point My sister got married to my brother in law who was my future husband s brother I also once dated Mabel s late husband Jonas who was 7 years my senior My sister Mabel once dated diamond king Tony Van Scoy by the way and dated my future husband I snuck out of my house sometime after my 17th birthday and met up with my future husband John who was 22 at the time And we did some this and I was knocked up with my eldest son John Jr So my dad forced marriage on us on October 28 1955 me and John got married My son was born on June 9 1956 And my sister had a little girl in September and we d push strollers together and they thought that my niece and my son were twins My son was very sweet and close with my niece even in adulthood My husband treated me nicely and I was invited to come to his HUGE family reunions I gave birth to my son Robert Thomas in 1958 it was around this time me and Mabel moved next door to each other in the County and it was the best And after this in 1960 I gave birth to my first baby with wings Brian and he had his stomach on the outside of his abdomen He passed three days later which broke my heart badly My niece named her son after my late son Brian Then I gave birth to my daughter Louise Marie in 1963 The same year my dad died of a heart attack as my sister s youngest daughter sat on his lap My mom threw herself into her cooking and she was good at it BIG TIME I miss it After my dad died my brother quit his job to live with my mom He robbed her kicked her and one time shoved her down the stairs This went on for many years afterwards In 1964 I miscarried twin girls and my husband John left the 109th Field Artillery after this to focus on me and his family getting a job with his brother Jonas as a part time police officer And in 1965 I gave birth to my daughter Kathleen who died the next day She couldn t breathe and it was hard seeing her next to me like that and the image of her pained face haunts me 60 years later This time I didn t grief I went into shock so I decided no more kids My three were enough In 1968 my sister in law Rebecca passed away followed by her brother Toots in 1970 they both had young kids my husband was one of 12 My mom died in 1977 of a heart attack My brother refused to call an ambulance and she passed away She was 65 My brother ran off and I never saw him again And I was around my sister more than ever we had such deep conversations and I miss her terribly And later in 1985 my brother in law Jonas passed away It broke my husband they were close always working together I became a grandmother in 1978 which is something I always loved her name is Karen Around this time I left my job and John and I enjoyed retirement early Now it s just weddings and grandchildren And in 1995 my husband went for a surgery for a blood clot on his shoulder and it went to his brain and quickly burst and my husband died of a stroke And it took me a while to get myself together and around Christmas 1996 my eldest son called me from South Carolina because he had taken an overdose of pills to kill himself and wanted to call me to say goodbye He died before getting to the hospital and I didn t utter a word until 1997 until when my great granddaughter Ashlya was born Shortly after my son died his daughter Karen had a baby girl And I learned to talk again In 2002 I got a call that my brother had died and wanted me to claim his remains I told him to keep the body so now he is in a state cemetery with his wife Mary Although he was a terrible man I grew up around him and it still sucked My sister was diagnosed with Dementia in 2009 and passed three years later which I couldn t take it anymore We spent almost 70 years by each other s side At the point I had 9 great grandchildren and I now have 15 or 16 While my sister had great great grandchildren And i forgot to mention my sister ran a daycare where a disabled boy drowned in 1995 and my sister was hated by our town And it was wrongful it was mean because it was an accident I had stuff thrown at me because I was her sister and I had to do my shopping at night and my husband had just died So it was very hard And now here In March of 2025 my daughter Louise put me in a nursing home I fought for a while but I m getting too weak to fight back In a few years and months I ll be with my children because I might have Alzheimer s Disease just like my sister did And I m ready to go up to them I ve lived a happy and long life and I wanted to share my story because it truly is long and it s just very fun to live with such a good family Goodbye Claire",86,Female,

to break me I m still standing I ve been through more than most people will in their entire lives by my age Growing up everything was a battle I wasn t the golden child in my family I was the one always misunderstood the one pushed aside the one whose dreams were crushed by the very people who were supposed to support me If you ve ever felt like your family just doesn t get you doesn t see your worth or worse actively works against you then you ll understand where I m coming from Here s the thing I wasn t born with a silver spoon in my mouth In fact if anything I was born into a toxic cycle My family never believed in me at least not in the way they should have Instead I was constantly met with disdain harsh words and a level of manipulation I didn t fully understand until I was older I thought that because they were my family they would be there to guide me But they weren t guiding me they were holding me back The Toxicity of My Family A Never Ending Cycle There s a quote that goes Family is everything But sometimes family is the very thing that holds you down And in my case they were the chains that kept me from flying It was always my sister who was the favorite always praised always pampered She could do no wrong Me I was always the one who had to fight for approval It didn t matter how hard I worked how much I pushed myself or how much I tried to be the best version of myself nothing was ever good enough When I was 14 I started working night shifts all while trying to juggle school I was trying to make money for something I was passionate about gaming and esports It was my dream But that dream was shattered the moment my dad lost money to a scam Instead of understanding that I was trying to build something for myself my family took away my phone my access to my games and everything that kept me sane They didn t even try to understand why I needed it Instead they saw it as a luxury something that should be taken away for the sake of discipline Two years of this Two years of my dreams being locked away I was 16 when I realized that everything I had worked for had been taken from me I watched as my family destroyed what was left of my dreams And for what So they could teach me a lesson The betrayal stung so much but instead of giving in I pushed back But the damage was done I stopped trusting them And deep down I knew they didn t understand me and they never would The Toxic Sister and the Unfair Treatment Let me talk about my sister for a second It s not like I don t care for her but damn the way she was used to manipulate everything in the house was something else She s 14 now and honestly it s like I ve watched this whole thing unfold for years and nothing ever changes Here s the deal she was the favorite Even when she wasn t doing well in school and let me tell you she s weak in studies she d still get more attention and forgiveness for everything she did She would throw tantrums act out break things say whatever the hell she wanted to say and it was like nobody noticed On the other hand I could barely breathe without getting reprimanded or treated like I was some sort of failure No matter how hard I worked no matter what I did I was always the one left carrying the weight of this invisible burden that nobody else had to deal with I remember every time I tried to stand up for myself I d be told I wasn t respectful enough Meanwhile my sister She would do whatever she wanted and it was like everyone thought she was untouchable I d get blamed for things I didn t do my efforts were ignored and I was the one punished for everything And no one ever questioned it But there was a moment one moment that changed everything for me It happened after one of those classic family blow ups My dad was once again talking about how I didn t respect my sister and how she was just like my mom while I was somehow this different difficult person He looked at me and said Your sister is just like your mom but you you re nothing like me That line hit me like a slap in the face For a second I thought I d lost it But I didn t let it go I snapped back So if she s like mom does that mean I m supposed to be like you Am I just supposed to be the one who always gets blamed while she does whatever she wants Is that how this works There was a moment of silence and I swear it felt like time stopped My dad didn t have a response He couldn t I was calling out the hypocrisy the double standards and for once he had no comeback I d hit him with the truth and he couldn t handle it But that silence didn t change anything It didn t stop the way my sister was treated like royalty while I was the one constantly undermined It didn t make my dad change his ways And it certainly didn t make my mom stand up for me It was like everything I said everything I felt didn t matter I was just the difficult one and she was always the innocent misunderstood one no matter what The Betrayal of Relationships But it wasn t just my family that hurt me it was the people I trusted the most The people I loved I ve had 3 girlfriends and out of those 1 were complete disasters she cheated she lied They betrayed me But I m not here to talk about her I m here to talk about the two relationships that could have worked I wasn t perfect I had anger issues and I wasn t always the best partner But when I loved I loved hard I gave everything I had And I always thought that love was about loyalty and understanding But the two relationships I thought would work out ended because of something simple miscommunication They didn t understand me and I didn t understand them They wanted me to be calm to be someone I wasn t They wanted me to be perfect But perfection doesn t exist What they didn t get was that I wasn t a villain I was just a person who loved deeply and needed time to grow Even though they broke up with me I understand now that it wasn t about me being too much It was about us not being able to communicate effectively I ll never forget what one of them said to me I left him because of his anger He would do anything for me but if he was calm maybe we could have fixed things That hit hard because it made me realize that the only thing standing between me and the kind of love I wanted was my inability to understand and control my own emotions I don t hold grudges against them I don t hate them But I learned something important in those relationships if someone can t love you for who you are flaws anger and all they weren t meant for you The Isolation at School There was a time when I was just 11 years old sitting in the middle of a classroom full of kids who didn t care about what was going on in my world The room was full of noise chatter and the clattering of pens and books but I felt like I was in a completely different place a silent island surrounded by people who were worlds apart from me And then it happened It started slowly little by little at first it was just a whisper in the halls But one day my parents decided to come to my school They didn t just come to visit no They came to make a scene to remind me and everyone else of their version of discipline They marched right into that classroom and without a word to anyone they told my teacher to move me separate me from the one person who I thought might be the only friend I had My desk mate someone who at that moment felt like the only human bridge to normalcy was torn away from me And just like that I was left sitting alone in the middle of a room where the laughter of my classmates echoed off the walls but none of it was aimed at me It wasn t just about physical distance It was about the message they sent me that day They looked at me like I was a problem to be fixed a nuisance to be ignored They made sure I knew that I wasn t allowed to be like the other kids that I was different not in a good way The worst part They didn t even need to say a word Everyone knew Everyone saw From that day on I wasn t just the kid who was different I was the one who didn t belong The kid whose parents could show up anytime unannounced to make sure the world knew that I wasn t good enough to be just another student Every glance every whisper in that classroom after that day felt like a dagger I was isolated not just from my friends but from my own hope And even though it may have seemed like a small thing to them to me it was a world shattering moment The thing about being isolated in school by the people who should have protected you is that it doesn t just stop in the classroom It follows you It buries itself deep inside you and tells you every day that you re not worth the effort that you don t deserve to belong That was my reality for a long time being the outsider the kid who never truly fit in And yet even through the humiliation and rejection something deep inside me pushed back Because when you re alone like that you either let it break you or you learn to own your space in the world ge 20 Fighting for my future and breaking the chains of my past I m 20 years old and I ve been through hell but if there s one thing I ve learned it s that no matter how much the world tries to break me I m still standing I ve been through more than most people will in their entire lives by my age Growing up everything was a battle I wasn t the golden child in my family I was the one always misunderstood the one pushed aside the one whose dreams were crushed by the very people who were supposed to support me If you ve ever felt like your family just doesn t get you doesn t see your worth or worse actively works against you then you ll understand where I m coming from Here s the thing I wasn t born with a silver spoon in my mouth In fact if anything I was born into a toxic cycle My family never believed in me at least not in the way they should have Instead I was constantly met with disdain harsh words and a level of manipulation I didn t fully understand until I was older I thought that because they were my family they would be there to guide me But they weren t guiding me they were holding me back Expected to Be Perfect Allowed To be Nothing I wasn t allowed to make mistakes Every time I failed it was like I was being punished My dad instead of being supportive acted like I owed him something like I was the one who was responsible for all the mistakes he made They never tried to help me achieve my goals They tried to mold me into what they wanted me to be but never once asked me what I wanted It was always about what was easiest for them What worked for them When I was trying to break into the gaming world they never supported me It didn t matter that I was working night shifts or doing everything I could to make a name for myself They only saw the end result the games the hours I spent playing and the passion I had for esports They didn t see the work behind it Instead they saw an addiction something that was taking me away from what they thought I should be doing I wasn t allowed to make a single decision without being scrutinized It didn t matter if it was about my future my friends or my passions I was always the one who was wrong And yet despite all of this I still tried to make things work I worked even harder I tried harder to prove myself to show them that I could be the person they wanted me to be But it was never enough I wasn t allowed to make mistakes and when I did they would hold it over my head like some kind of weapon Then came the final punch in the gut After I graduated with a B Com at the age of 19 way ahead of many I was promised something A chance to chase my dream animation I held on to that promise like a child gripping the last thread of hope I had waited two years for that moment grinding in silence dreaming in color And then just like that on a random night it was gone I was learning digital art building my skills and finally feeling like I was on the path I had always dreamed of But then my father called me He told me to talk with my sister see how I was doing check in with her So I did A call From someone I never expected to break me my big cousin sister The one I used to look up to The one I used to say was like the big sister I never had I loved her Respected her Trusted her But that night she shattered me Listen she said casually like it was just another conversation Animation It s good but compared to IT companies it s not stable It s a waste of time Why not learn coding There s a future in that You ll get a job It s better Better for who though I paused I was confused at first Then angry Then hollow Before I spoke I was already feeling the weight of the conversation that had been brewing inside me I waited two damn years to do this one thing I whispered trying to stay calm trying to hold myself together I did everything they asked I passed every test I gave up everything I loved I kept my head down and waited And now just like that It s gone She sighed as if I was overreacting You re just emotional right now Be practical This is what s good for you Good for me No one even asked what I wanted Not once Not even her And then came the words that hit hardest of all Think about your family she said Look how poor they are You re the one who should look out for them You need to think about the future It wasn t about whether coding was bad It was about being told again that my dreams didn t matter That my choices were disposable That I was a puppet only allowed to move the way they wanted I broke down after that call Not with rage But with heartbreak It hurt more coming from her She was supposed to be different But she chose their side She tried to convince me like I was stupid Like I didn t know what I was capable of Like my passion was just a phase But the worst part It wasn t just that call It was the broken promises For years they promised me a laptop an actual laptop so I could study animation create and bring my vision to life They knew how much it meant to me Ever since I was a child I had a love for drawing That passion never left me Even in college I stood out I received a gold medal and multiple certificates for my artistic talent My professors supported me My teachers knew my potential Yet when the time came to support me they didn t That night I sat alone staring at nothing eyes burning soul numb And it hit me No one in this family wanted me to live my life They just wanted me to live theirs Three Months Later It had been three months since that call since the night my dreams were shattered by the cold reality of my family s expectations A lot had happened in that time and yet nothing had changed I was still stuck in the same rut But now the anger inside me wasn t so fresh It had turned into something darker Resentment And I had learned something I wasn t ready to face I hated everything I had to learn everything I had done for them I remember that day clearly the day I finally got the laptop The one they promised me would be for animation for my art I had dreamed about it for so long picturing the screen lighting up with possibilities my creative mind coming to life But no When the laptop finally arrived it wasn t for animation It was for coding And I hated it I hated how I had to pretend to care about something I had no passion for just to please them Coding wasn t me It wasn t what I dreamed of But they didn t care They didn t ask They just handed it to me like a consolation prize for all the times I had to put aside my desires for theirs The truth hit me harder than anything they didn t care about my dreams They didn t care about me The promise of animation seemed like a joke now A lie I didn t get the laptop for animation I got it to follow their path to do something that they thought was better for me To follow their ideal of stability I spent countless nights sitting in front of that laptop staring at lines of code I could barely understand feeling my soul drain with each keystroke The passion I once had for art for animation was slipping through my fingers like sand Every time I tried to draw every time I tried to focus on what I truly wanted to do the weight of their expectations bore down on me It was suffocating At first I tried to make it work I pushed myself tried to convince myself that maybe coding wasn t so bad Maybe I could just learn it get the job and maybe just maybe I d be able to live out my dream of animation once I had the stability they kept talking about But the more I tried the more hollow I felt Coding wasn t my dream Animation was And I hated myself for pretending to be someone I wasn t for learning something I didn t care about all for the sake of family Three months had passed and I was more lost than ever I kept thinking about all the times I sacrificed for them the nights I stayed up studying things I didn t want to learn the hours spent doing what they thought was best for me I wanted to scream I wanted to break free But every time I tried the fear of disappointing them held me back A Family Crisis You d Never Expect So here s the situation that still haunts me this whole 9k fiasco that ended up being more of a nightmare than it should have ever been It s not just about money it s about how everything gets twisted manipulated and how I m left holding the blame for things that aren t even my fault I was about 19 years old at the time still trying to make sense of everything going on in my life I was away at a distant village attending a birthday party I didn t even want to go to It was a place I didn t care about with relatives I barely knew but I went because family right The whole 9 hour train ride to get there was a drag but I made the trip I was talking with some distant relatives I hadn t seen since before Corona hit That s when it happened My phone buzzed and I saw my mom calling I thought it was a routine check in but no this was the start of something I couldn t have expected She sounded off panicking even and she goes Where did you put the 9k I need to know right now At first I thought maybe something went wrong and the money had been misplaced But then I realized what she was talking about the 9k from the 24k total amount that had been used to pay off some family debt Here s the twist I didn t even touch the damn 9k It was money that had been repaid at the gold debt office after we d settled that issue My mom had forgotten that we had paid that debt off and received the gold back Yet now I was being dragged into this mess as if I had stolen the 9k or wasted it on gambling It gets worse While I m trying to understand what the hell she s talking about my grandma who was with me at the time takes the phone She talks with my mom for a minute and that s when the story starts to get out of control Now as the minutes tick by I m still sitting there at the party trying to keep my cool and handle whatever chaos is happening on the other side of the phone Suddenly my mom says out of nowhere I know he used that 9k for games or gambling didn t he He probably lost it all already I was stunned I couldn t believe what I was hearing I had never used that money for anything other than what we agreed on It was all for the debt But here she was accusing me of gambling it away as if I had no sense of responsibility or self control She didn t even stop to think about the fact that she had given me that money to handle in the first place The money she had entrusted me with while my dad was off doing whatever he was doing drinking being reckless not paying attention to the family She told me to handle that 24k knowing that I was the one who had to deal with all of it while everything else in our family was falling apart But that didn t matter right No in her mind I was the one who screwed up I was the one who used that 9k to waste on something as stupid as games or gambling And when my grandma handed the phone back to me my mom wasn t backing down The damage was already done I asked her again Mom why are you doing this I didn t touch that money It was already repaid at the gold office We got the gold back It s not what you re saying But instead of listening she just kept going She kept pushing the same narrative that I was a screw up that I couldn t handle money that I was just like every other disappointment It was like she didn t even care about the truth anymore only about blaming me for something I didn t do And here s where it really hit me I had been the one trying to keep the family afloat trying to manage everything the best I could while dealing with their drama and poor decisions But all I ever got was accusations blame and guilt No one ever took a step back to realize how much I was handling No one cared to acknowledge that I was trying to make things work Instead they just kept dumping more on me hoping I d fail so they could say See We were right all along And in the end I was just left standing there trying to process everything I was supposed to be the one who held it all together but I was constantly being torn down accused of things I didn t do blamed for failures I had no part in It s like they could never see me for what I was doing or how hard I was trying The Next Day The following day was just as messed up as the day before I was still feeling the weight of everything that had gone down with the 9k and to be honest I just wanted to forget the whole thing But the chaos wasn t over Out of nowhere my grandma calls again I knew something was up but I didn t expect it to be this bad She was on the phone with my uncle my mom s big brother and started explaining the whole situation to him Apparently grandma knew the truth from the start and she was defending me saying I hadn t done anything wrong She even told my uncle that I was innocent that I didn t touch the money I couldn t help but feel a tiny sense of relief hearing that someone in the family was standing up for me but at the same time it felt like too little too late My uncle always the more reasonable one in the family backed me up without hesitation He knew my character and he d seen me growing up From the moment I was a kid he knew I wasn t the type to mess up like this He defended me like a lion telling grandma that he was 100 sure I hadn t touched the money or used it for gambling or games He had always seen me as the responsible one even when my own parents didn t But of course when the truth finally came to light my mom wasn t having any of it She called me soon after and her tone was anything but apologetic Yeah we paid the debt she said almost like it was a confession But I m still confused why I didn t remember If your uncle had said something first why wouldn t I remember I was stunned There she was still trying to twist things still trying to make it seem like I was the one who had done something wrong She couldn t even bring herself to admit her mistake without trying to justify it It was infuriating The weight of everything finally hit me in that moment Here I was fighting to keep everything together doing my best to manage the responsibilities the family placed on me and yet it felt like I was never going to get out of the shadows of their accusations I had become so used to this toxic environment that it was starting to feel like I would never escape I wasn t even allowed to have a single win without it being undermined twisted or dismissed And honestly It broke me I remember walking away from the phone call tears filling my eyes my chest heavy with emotions I couldn t even process The exhaustion of constantly fighting to prove myself The betrayal The guilt The hopelessness I hated my life I hated the family I had been born into I hated feeling like nothing I did was ever good enough But there was more to it than just anger There was a sense of deep sadness a hollow ache in my chest that only came from trying so hard and still being treated like the villain My mom had no idea how much damage she d caused by blaming me for something that wasn t my fault And my dad He was nowhere to be found probably drunk somewhere oblivious to the chaos that had unfolded in his absence I was left in a space of deep isolation a place where I couldn t even trust the people I d once called family No one understood me No one saw me for what I truly was a person who had been carrying too much weight for too long And the worst part They didn t even care enough to make things right I spent the rest of that day alone battling with myself My mind was spinning with thoughts of everything I had lost everything I had sacrificed But there was also a flicker of something else something that refused to die something that kept pushing me forward That something was me Even though I hated the situation even though I wanted to give up on everything there was still a part of me that couldn t quit I was tired broken misunderstood but I wasn t done I knew I had to keep moving forward even if it meant facing this nightmare alone So yeah my family didn t save me They couldn t The only person who could get me out of this hole the only one who would be there to help me rise above it all was me I knew that And no matter how much I wanted to give in to let the guilt and shame consume me there was a fire inside that wouldn t let me quit I was the only one who truly understood what I was capable of And that s why even though my family didn t get it even though they blamed me and twisted the truth I kept pushing forward Because in the end the only person whose opinion mattered was mine And with that I knew I would rise above it all I wouldn t let their mistakes their misunderstandings or their toxic ways define me I would build myself back up and maybe just maybe I d find peace in knowing that I was stronger than any of them ever realized The Spark That Wasn t Meant to Burn After all the silence all the pain something inside me began to stir again It wasn t animation at least not yet But it was something I started to get curious about AI and data science Maybe it was the logic Maybe it was the idea of building something intelligent Maybe I just wanted to find meaning in this mess I had been forced into But this time I was the one who chose it Not them I didn t jump into it blindly I took two months off before touching it Two months where I felt half baked Incomplete I had learned Python sure but just enough to know how far I still had to go I wasn t ready back then My mind was still recovering from everything I lost From everything they crushed But when I was ready I thought maybe if I studied this on my own terms it d be different So I did the one thing they always asked for I asked them I told them I want to study Help me I need some money to enroll in the course At first They agreed They said Yeah sure And for a brief moment I believed them But life with them always has a twist right A few days later they hit me with it Don t you have money from your part time job Pay from that We don t have money now I froze The money they were talking about That was my money The little I had scraped together working nights saving every rupee with one dream in mind to finally buy my animation tools A pen tablet Better RAM Maybe a second screen someday They knew that They knew They told me themselves We ll help you buy your animation gear Another promise Another lie And now That savings that tiny island of hope I d built in secret was being dragged away too They didn t care that I d been through hell and still tried They didn t care that this wasn t just some course for me That I was trying to rise from the wreck they left me in I wasn t asking for luxuries I wasn t wasting their money on games or gadgets I was fighting for a chance For growth For independence And even that was too much for them They turned my dreams into a currency they never planned to pay The Fight for Success At 16 when my dreams of gaming and esports were destroyed I had to pick up the pieces of my shattered future I tried to go back to school tried to act like everything was fine but it wasn t My family didn t get it They didn t see that my drive my passion was what kept me alive Without it I felt like I was dying on the inside But I never gave up I worked harder I started learning about data science AI and improving my FPS skills In just four months I went from being a complete beginner to understanding the ins and outs of the game I ve always had this fire inside me that refuses to die Sure I m still learning and I m not perfect But I m moving forward I don t drink I don t smoke My biggest vice is masturbation and even then I don t let it control me and eventually i dropped that habit I stay focused I push myself But more than anything I keep my eyes on the prize building something for myself Something that will eventually make everything worth it The Truth About Who I Am I m not perfect I ve made mistakes I ve had my fair share of downfalls But here s the thing I m still fighting I m still pushing forward I m not letting my past define me I m not letting anyone dictate who I am or who I will become If you re reading this and you ve ever felt like life is working against you like you ve been stuck in a cycle of disappointment and heartache know this You re not alone And you re not weak You re stronger than you realize You just have to keep going You just have to keep fighting Because in the end you are the one who writes your story And no matter how many times life knocks you down you get back up Every Single Time The Final Decision Between Love and Escape So here I am now 20 years old standing at the edge of a cliff that s more emotional than physical After everything I ve been through every lie tossed at me every blame thrown every time I stood alone while they all pointed fingers I ve hit a wall A point where I m finally asking What now On one hand there s this fire in me This voice screaming Run Cut the cord Burn the bridge You don t owe them anything Just vanish Build a life so far from this mess they ll need a telescope to even guess what I became Fly high disappear ghost the bloodline like I was never born into it Start fresh where I don t carry the burden of their mistakes where I m not the emotional punching bag Live not as their son but as my own creation My own man But on the other hand they re my parents Yeah they hurt me They broke things in me that I m still trying to fix They turned love into guilt and trust into chains But I also remember that look in their eyes the one that says they re lost too That they re drowning in their own wounds repeating the same broken cycles because no one ever showed them another way I remember that I once gave them hope I was the one who promised I ll make your wishes come true That s the messed up part I still want to Deep inside there s a piece of me that wants to give them the life they never had I want to become someone so great that even my father drunk and defeated will one day sit down and say That s my son And my mom as toxic as her words get I know she s been broken for years I know she s just passing on the pain she never got to heal from I get it I do But just because I understand them doesn t mean I should have to suffer for them I m stuck between being the son who saves them and the man who saves himself It hurts Every day Because whichever road I choose I lose something If I stay and fulfill their dreams I might never have the chance to chase my own I ll be a puppet in their tragedy slowly turning into someone I swore I d never be If I leave I might live with the guilt that I abandoned the very people who gave me life That I let them crumble when they had no one else That I became the villain in a story where all I ever wanted was to be the hero and Right now I m torn between cutting ties and staying for their sake What do you think is the right thing to do or am I overreacting or does this hurt the way I think it does So what do I want Peace Real peace A life where love isn t a weapon where I m not questioned every time I speak truth where I can laugh without wondering who s going to twist it tomorrow I want to wake up without a weight in my chest I want to live not just survive I want someone to say You don t have to fight today it s okay to rest I ve got you I want a home where I m not walking on eggshells where I m not blamed for ghosts I never summoned I want a family one day one I build from scratch where my kids never have to cry alone like I did And until then I want space Time Healing Not revenge Not hatred Just a clean break A fresh start Even if it means being misunderstood forever Even if they call me ungrateful or heartless Because I m not heartless That s the real curse I care too damn much And maybe that s why I need to go Not to run but to finally breathe peace off your friendly spidy",20,Male,

text body: I am 22 years old and I am currently in my last year of college and I am also autistic and I feel like my mom doesn t trust me to be independant For example I am 22 years old and I still don t even have a driver s license and a few months ago I finaly got my permit When I was a teenager in high school I would try and get my mom to let me learn how to drive but she wouldn t let me or take me to driver s ed and wouldn t want to have any discussion about me learning how to drive The reason why is because I am autisitc and she thinks that I would have a hard time paying attention This is a common thing in autistic people but at the same time there are plently of autsitic people or other people with conditions like ADHD who can drive perfectly fine Her and I have aruged about this and I ve brought this point up to her and she s mentioned that she knows this I think it s unfair of her to just shoot down any possibility of me learning how to drive in the past when she wouldn t even at least give me a chance to see if I could actually handle driving or not I also don t have any extended family who could help me since they don t live in the same state and my father is out of the picture She was basically the only person who could have helped learn how to drive during this time In the past few years whenever I have mentioned to her learning how to drive she alsways uses some excuse to get out of the discussion She ll say things like we re trying to pay for college right now or You re a not a teenager you should learn how to pay for things on your own I want to see you get a job first I have a job when I am on break from college but it s a job that is walking distance from where I live I feel like it s going to be a lot harder for me to get a job at other places if I don t drive Sometimes uses my autism as an excuse However if I don t drive than I can t take driving lessons so I would need somebody to take me She gets annoyed when I would ask her about drivers ed over the past couple of years but I feel like she doesn t have the right to be annoyed with me about this because I feel like if she had just let me learn how to drive in high school like I was supposed to than I wouldn t be bringing it up to her now So if she gets annoyed with me about this than I feel like that s her fault and it s unfair for her to get annoyed with me about asking how to learn how to drive It also bothers me how my mom is telling me how I need to be more independant but how does she expect me to be independent if she doesn t let me do things that are going to actually allow me be independant Over the couple of years my mom got a new boyriend who I really get a long with and he agrees with me that I need to learn how to drive and so does my older brother After a while of convincing her a few months ago I finally got my permit for driving and she didn t even seem happy about it when I passed the test She looked more concerned than anything which really bothered me Later when we talked about me taking drivers ed courses to get my license during the summer she makes jokes like When you drive we re probabaly going to have to have helmets on This comment really bothered me because how does she know that I would be a bad driver if she s never given me a chance to drive She is saying this too because I am autistic I also feel like my mom is criticizing me about everything that I do it could be anything from the way my hair looks to the way I am dressed to something I decide to buy for myself Over the past six months i ve lost some weight too because i ve been trying to get more serious about the gym and my diet Since I ve lost weight she has been calling me skinny boy to tease me but I hate it when she calls me that What really stuck out to me however was that one time she was on the phone with somebody and she said that she doesn t want me to lose anymore weight I haven t lost an amount of weight that would even be considered concerning I feel fine and healthy and I ve actaully been in the best shape that I ve been in in a long time I feel like she is undermining any sort of independant choice that I make for myself Recently I made some irresponsible financial decisions regarding a short film that I want to make I am a film major and wasn t happy with me I don t work when I am at college and work when I am on my winter and summer break and she sends me money if I ever need it The thing is that she insists that I shouldn t work when I am in college I live on campus because she thinks that school should be my main priority When I made the financial decisions for my short film she told me that I am acting like I am an adolescence and not like a responsible adult I agree with her to some extent that I still feel like a teenager but I feel like my mom hasn t really given a lot of guidance on how to be an adult I am concerned for my future because I don t know anything about taxes what it s going to take to get my own place etc because I feel like I don t know anything about being an adult When we ve talked about living on my own she suggested building a guest house for me or something which I doubt will happen but I feel like I want my own place I feel like she is only thinking about what she thinks is best for me and not taking my feelings into account I basically feel like my mom doens t trust me to be independant because I have autism TL DR I have autism and I feel like my mom uses this as a reason to infintalize me I need advice on what to do I ve been feeling this way for a long

text body: My wife and I promised each of our children the same amount of money toward their weddings Four are now married and in each of those cases their partners or their partners families contributed financially which felt appropriate and appreciated Of our two remaining kids one is a successful confirmed bachelor who s not interested in marriage or in taking anything from us The other is engaged to someone who unfortunately has quit every job they ve had I doubt they have any savings and it seems unlikely there will be financial support from their family Meanwhile our child is hardworking and career focused As far as I know their partner hasn t contributed anything to the wedding and relies heavily on our child for financial support Over the years I helped each of our children save money for their future something to give them a bit of long term stability For this child that savings has mostly been spent on rent and everyday expenses with their partner Watching that nest egg disappear has been incredibly difficult especially knowing that some of that money came from extended family members who genuinely wanted to support their future as well We re still following through with our commitment and giving the same wedding contribution we gave the others But I d be lying if I said it doesn t feel like we re being taken advantage of It seems like we re funding someone else s wedding and lifestyle someone who hasn t made much of an effort to contribute build stability or form a connection with our family I ve tried to talk with our child about this They were sad and remorseful at the time but nothing really changed They always defend their partner I get it loyalty matters But it s hard to feel like there s any room left for honest feedback or concern from our side What makes this even more painful is how defensive our child has become especially toward me I ve kept most of these feelings to myself out of fear of pushing them away I ve mentioned gently that I think their partner should contribute more but I haven t pushed it The truth is I don t know if there s any way to talk about this without hurting them and that thought breaks my heart They spend far more time with their partner s family than they do with us now And it s starting to feel like we ve been quietly replaced We used to be so close I worry that we ve lost that and I don t know how to get it back I m not trying to buy their loyalty or control their life I respect each of our kids for the choices they make and the people they ve become This isn t about control it s about trying to preserve a relationship that means everything to me without surrendering every healthy boundary to do it Has anyone else gone through something like this How do you bring up these kinds of concerns with honesty and care without driving your child further away I feel stuck And honestly I m heartbroken As a side note I keep asking myself Do I hold back some of the money Would that be fair Would that be wrong I m truly not trying to punish anyone I just don t know what the right thing is anymore",,Male,father

text body: I am a 27F I had an abortion roughly 4 years ago and I regretted it so much Weeks would go by and I maybe had roughly 30 hours of sleep I pleaded to God for his forgiveness I felt so guilty and I decided I was against abortion I recently got caught up with the wrong guy 32M who masked as someone he wasn t Once the mask was lifted I realized he is a horrible human being who is financially emotionally unstable a drug addict and is also obsessed with his ex He got me pregnant while I was trying to dig deep into my spirituality and my opinions on abortion were even stronger We had discussions about what would happen if I got pregnant because he came in me every time we had sex We had unprotected sex a lot He claimed that we would figure it out Based upon his actions I m assuming that he was avidly trying to get me pregnant I guess I was too because of the guilt I experienced from my previous abortion To make it even worse we never had a romantic playful relationship and are the furthest thing away from being in love Come to find out he was having sex with 5 other girls and his ex regularly during this time It disgusted me so much Someone cannot give a fuck about you so much that they are cumming inside you while increasing the risk of you getting an STD or maybe getting more than one girl pregnant at one time It blows my mind how horrible people can be A little more background information at the beginning of my pregnancy my hormones were raging and I did not cope with it well I was making irrational decisions I moved out of the town we were both living in to move in with my mom During this time he was accusing me of lying about being pregnant and treated me so badly something I will NEVER forget Claiming he wants to be with someone who cares about their appearance while he has a horrible reputation from being a junky When he found out that I moved he moved locations too but soon got evicted Which makes me wonder if he couldn t pay rent at his place before moving He had to move in with his mom He then ended up losing his job because of his coke addiction At this time he was pretty down bad He used me and the baby to convince his mom to help him financially to provide stable living quarters for me and my child When I visited him for a weekend to move some of my things in and prepare for our child he stayed out all night and did coke until around 4 5 am My baby is in NICU One night my baby s doctor called me claiming he needed emergency surgery which he didn t end up needing He seemed as though he didn t care and just wanted to me to stay there I couldn t understand why he didn t care as much as I did I decided to not move in with him because I don t want my kid around drugs and we didn t connect in a relationship kind of way It was honestly weird being there I can t be vulnerable with people who are weird acting I ended up moving my stuff out of his place He was so upset about it and didn t speak to me the entire time He didn t even help me bring my things to the car after I just had a c section I had forgotten the parking pass I was using when I stayed there He claims he was upset over that He probably needed it for the girls that he sleeps with To make matters worse I noticed he didn t have on his bracelet what is required to see our baby in NICU that has my name printed on it He said he woke up one morning and it was off he ripped it off in his sleep While he wasn t there I looked through his stuff to find it especially in his night stand and could never find it He definitely lied about that He recently visited the town that we lived in together for a wedding yet he can t take off of work or borrow his family s car to come see his kid At the end of his trip he informed me he was on his way to the hospital to see our son I accused him of using our son so that he could borrow his mom s car to whore around his ex that he was booking up with was at the wedding He needed me to get into the hospital Considered everything I wrote before I didn t go to the hospital to let him in He texted me and said fuck you we re done During my pregnancy I worked two jobs and ended up having to have an emergency c section at 30 weeks due to developing HEELP syndrome Not one time did he come and visit me or want to help me He and his mother just accused me of lying and created so much drama in my life that I cried almost every day Now I am stuck in this charity house while my baby is in NICU rotting away I m so depressed and I wish I could visit my friends and experience life and be happy again but I know that s over with bc I don t have anyone to watch my son Everyone s thinks that since I had a kid so irresponsibly that I shouldn t be able to enjoy life anymore Meanwhile all of this is happening he tried to love bomb me use me to pay his utilities and dog me every chance he got bc he isn t happy with who he is He s so insecure that he tries to bring me down every chance he gets I have experience so much trauma from this experience I do not want any more kids I just don t know how to get over this I m also obsessed with stalking his ex on social media because she looks better than me I don t know what to do who I am or what I want I ve been contemplating giving my kid up for adoption something I ve been thinking about since pregnancy Oh and by the way we had sex when I visited him that weekend and I am now pregnant again I am so disappointed in myself I guess from where I have zero fun or interests or hobbies I result to risky behavior for a dopamine rush I have an appointment scheduled with planned parenthood for an abortion I keep telling myself that I should ve aborted the kid I have now He was born premature because the dude got me pregnant before him had an unknown miscarriage didn t know I was pregnant at the time and immediately got pregnant again I just blame him for ruining my life He lives in a fantasy world and somehow I got lost in it as well I wish I could just rewind the last two years of my life and do everything differently At least whenever I hold my baby now all of my problems seem to go away I think I m having second thoughts about keeping my baby because of my hormone spike and feeling so down Disclaimer sorry for my writing I m not good at flow I have ADHD brain",27,Female,

not know 1 whether I had other children or 2 that I lived in another town 20 mins away A week later I asked my therapist to facilitate a conversation with my husband who has been in the picture for 12 years Sara and I Sara pretty much just dug in and wouldn t really open up about why she suddenly wanted to live w her dad When my ex caught wind of that conversation he dragged my daughter into a deposition to try to get my therapist s license revoked This is who we re dealing with Last summer he took her on a two week vacation the longest he s ever had her at one go Because he refused to let me know his plans until the last minute the only week left in the summer for my vacation time with her had to start on the day they got back Sara was in good spirits and texting and calling regularly thru her dad s vacation until about halfway through Then a few days before she was meant to return she called me and absolutely tore into me as a parent and as a person She accused me of trying to drive a wedge between her and her other household for years this is not true I am a product of divorce and while my father was a deadbeat my mother s constant diminishment of him behind his back made him more lovable pitiable in my eyes my entire childhood so I don t play that game We went on our vacation in August and I thought we were better Then one day in October I wake up to a text that her father committed her to a mental hospital bc she was threatening self harm This came out of absolute left field for me easily the scariest most traumatic thing I ever experienced We had to meet with her care team that first day and she refused to let my new husband into the meeting bc she doesn t see him as a parent but as a big brother I was furious that Dick would go so far as to commit her without speaking to me first but I went into emergency mode and let that slide as the only thing that mattered was Sara s well being Her week in the hospital was strange and she kept saying how good it was for her to be there and vaguely stating a fight with her stepmom is what prompted the trip to the er but she would not give any more details We ve been working with a family therapist ever since and I suppose it s helped me tolerate being in the same room as my ex and her work with my kiddo has been better than that other one who we fired but otherwise I haven t seen much improvement Sara typically goes with the flow and continues to come to our house 50 percent of the time but over the last couple of weeks Sara has been blowing up at me when I try to talk to her about why she dislikes my husband our household She is back to saying that she does not want to spend time at our house and I cannot get a straight answer from her other than that my husband and I are not parents to her in her eyes I told her I disagree and she gets incredibly hostile but cannot back her claim Last night she tells me that when she was 9 she and her step mom had a terrible relationship and that she Sara hated her She says she wanted to come live with us back then Now she says she sees the error of her ways and realizes she was being a brat I drew a parallel between how she s now feeling that way toward my husband and she got super angry and said it was not the same thing After rounds and rounds of me trying to draw out of her what she needs from us aside from my husband to stop harping on her about her excessive phone use she began to scream and cry and went to her room When I followed her up about 45 seconds later she was on the phone with her dad but pretended she wasn t I assume she hung up on him but for all I know he was still on for the rest of our conversation First she said she was going to have him pick her up I asked her not to we had a very calm conversation and she started to relax and return to normal We didn t discuss much I just explained to her how much I love her and how much I want her to be with us Things calmed down and then I suggested she get her shower and we d watch a movie before bed Next thing you know I hear something on top of the sound of running water in the bathroom and she s on the phone w her father SOBBING and relaying the story to him And while on one hand she was being fair in her retelling tho I only caught about 3 4 of the about 5 minute conversation what I did not hear were again any substantive complaints about what we re doing wrong and what she needs from us NOR did hear from him anything like desescalation or god forbid defense of me Here are her complaints She told me that she can t talk to me about anything even though she said in family therapy only days earlier that she could tell me anything She also said I was not a good mom and that she believes I shit talk about her behind her back again contradicting what she said in therapy about how she wasn t worried about me talking negatively about anyone anymore I shouldn t have to say this but there was nothing to be worried about to begin with She keeps saying she s going to give me one last chance to do what I do not know and then she s writing me off Also when I prod too deeply about when and why she had this revelation about me aka after two weeks on vacation with her dad a year ago she says she has a strong mental wall around this topic and if it breaks then she s going to be back in the mental hospital again Every time I try to tease out clarification to a contradictory statement or something that doesn t ring true to me she claims I m manipulating her Ex When she called me from her dad s vacation to ream me out for being a terrible mother she also tried to get out of going on vacation with me when she returned I told her that was not an option that we had plans with my family and that she had four little cousins dying to see her She now claims I was manipulating her by using her cousins against her even though she will happily agree that she and her cousins had a great time that week The things she s saying to me are breaking my heart and make me feel so completely untethered from my own experience She keeps saying that her father and Katie helped her so much by putting her in the mental hospital because she was struggling so much with this and she s using it as proof of my failures But of course I didn t know that her dissatisfaction with my household was this pointed only that she had some kind of meltdown on vacation but I thought we d mended that Let s not forget that Sara herself cited a fight with Katie as the reason she had a mental health breakdown when we met with her social worker at the hospital But this rift was being continually discussed behind my back with Dick someone whose only goal since we split was to gain full custody a goal that is likely more pronounced now that he s facing down another divorce One last crucial point The only other times I have found myself so pointedly questioning my own reality was during my marriage to Dick This feels exactly like the trauma of gaslighting and invalidation I experienced in that marriage on a regular basis And yes some will point out she s been unhappy with me for a while But my point is that when I try to work on things with her and tell her I ll pursue any solution she d like including leaving my husband with whom I have a great marriage she cannot say what it is she wants or needs Has anyone ever experienced this I m feeling awful about myself heartbroken and I feel certain that I don t deserve this TL DR My kid is accusing me of being a bad parent but can t tell me how why I m worried my ex is behind it all Am I going crazy",,Female,mother

text body: hi everyone Im desperate for answers I really need help like so bad Questions are listed at the bottom im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory so this may be kinda long I am 20 and my younger sister is 17 I am a college student My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds mom is white and dad is black My parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten But I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing My dad was very involved in this sport I needed to practice everyday that s reasonable As I got older this sport grew into a monster I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches 1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3 4 summers straight and every day after school was dedicated to practicing I didnt mind this but my mom is heavily dedicated to school She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a s in my all AP advanced placement classes I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week This was my life from ages 12 18 I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college Once I left for college in 2023 I decided I was going to major in computer engineering My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them I ended up doing okay my first semester but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes leading to my suspension from the university I was in over my head in all of my classes My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college never asking about my mental health Only cared about my grades and told me to do some soul searching I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic Now that its been a year im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December Since quitting sport which was my dads thing and failing school which was my moms thing i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me When I was 16 i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima which I was EXTREMELY grateful for took great care of and love it I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me I pay for my rent gas money and groceries which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years But My sister who is 17 got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year She has no pressure to be in any AP classes she doesnt have a job she doesnt play sports She has no pressures in life which has set her up for a great success in my opinion she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore she has picked up small hobbies in her free time She goes to school which shes late for all the time comes home takes a shower and takes a nap She stays in her room all the time whereas I am always socializing with my parents This started from a young age When I entered middle school I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this I love my younger sister to death and I dont blame her Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has or she ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better I try not to resent her its really hard I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family The most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college march2023 aug2023 when i left for college My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice I went to practice with a busted lip bleeding nose and huge bruise on my forehead My younger sister saw my mom wasnt home My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident but i could hold her off Obviously it was different than when my dad did it Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger I just moved home from college yesterday so we decided to go out to eat for dinner I was cheery and in a great mood dressed for the occasion appropriately making conversation the whole way laughing and trying to be pleasant My sister sat with her airpods in my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she didnt want to spend her sunday doing this She didnt even order food at the restaurant When we sat down for dinner my parents and I had a huge argument I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now When i left for college I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter She babysat for them a handful of times I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1 I clapped back at her since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job My parents got furious that I said that their only explanation was that it was their decision to parent how they want to parent They were infuriated with me instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude I know that parenting style differs from older sibling to younger sibling we are two different people so I completely understand that I just dont feel like its normal for me to feel this way and I don t feel like this is traditional or normal My whole family has tons of built up resentment towards each other with my grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc Now that you guys know my whole life story Questions I am absolutely terrified to pass this treatment down to my children How can I prevent this I want to live a happy successful life Should I seek therapy to help deal with all of the emotions and baggage this brings I do love my parents even though its been really hard It would be hard financially to cut them out How can I deal with this moving forward am i incorrect for feeling some resentment towards my sister i just really need some kind words and motivation because I am crying writing this I just dont understand how you could treat a real person like this for so long I am not trying to play the victim Sometimes i think its me is it me I dont understand why everything is targeted towards me I tried to explain this in a non bias way so that you guys could form your own opinions about it Thank you guys for reading and I already appreciate you for taking the time to read all of this tl dr Ive been dealing with the drastic differences of my parents parental style between my sister and I for 10 years",20,,sibling

text body: I am an addict in recovery my addiction took hold while I was an independent adult and while there was plenty of unmanageability and chaos in my own life prior to coming to recovery I never stole from my family damaged their property physically abused them or harmed them in any way other than emotional stress and trauma as a result of worrying about me which should not be taken lightly However my parents are of the belief that their worries and stresses should not be placed on their children and so I know that my brother was not told about any of the things my parents knew or witnessed and he was not present himself Rather my parent s lack of trust in the disease and what I could be like if I started using again seems to be an excuse for my brother to do what he wants and not what is right I gave my brother my car when I moved to a different part of Canada rather than sell it and keep the proceeds for myself on the condition that he never sell it He was to offer it back to me for first right of refusal if he was done with it and it was useable Instead I found out two months ago or so that he had my father sell it for him I was outraged because at the time I would have taken it back from him My father then told me that he was going to give me half the proceeds from the sale which was great but not what I asked for My parents tried to defend themselves and my brother for deciding to sell it because I gave it to him but if I had known he was not going to give it back to me when he no longer wanted it I wouldn t have done that in the first place I was going to address this directly with my brother and then my partner got very sick again and died He was also an addict and he had a relapse that brought out the most chaotic and unmanageable side of this disease imaginable I did everything I humanly could for him but ultimately his body couldn t take it anymore and he died on April 6 My brother and I were not best friends but have always gotten along when we are together and I didn t even receive a text from him acknowledging that my partner who he had at the very least met had passed Today my parents and I met for lunch and my dad told me that my brother was wanting to use the tent I have for the bed of my truck the one I bought after I gave him at no cost at all to him my old car I was literally shocked what am I missing here Even in addiction if my brother s partner died I would have managed to acknowledge it definitely before I thought about asking them not via my parents to use something he owns",,,sibling

text body: I was not always treated or maybe felt like this Like I still remember I was so happy and me untill the age 8 9 I personally believe that this feeling of outsider started when I was 8 That was when my Lil bro was born When he was born he instantly just took away all the attention from people who once loved me so much and were so affectionate towards me including my dad My mom was always affectionate I can still remember a time where I could dance sing play talk and go out with my day and felt no uncomfortable about it But now everytime not only when my dad s around even when my mom s around I just make this kinda mental barrier to not expose or talk or be myself much Like for example i can t even talk freely to my mom about the business I am currently working on My behaviour as a 18year old male changes when they are around And the I feel like if they never treated me like center of attention when I was a kid and gave so much love and affection and just treated me normally i might have been Normal Now it just feels like all those love is long gone I still sometimes find my dad enjoy my childhood videos but it just feels like i can t get back to it But this problem is also becoming a big reason why I can t make much friends even tho I want to I know a lot of you have gone through such family situations and has found a way out of it I would love to know about you and how you got out of that problem",18,Male,sibling

text body: For context my sister and I are teenage twins and our family has a history of mental illness Both my parents had traumatic childhoods with my mom s anxiety disorder passing on to me and my dad s chronic depression as well My extended family consists of alcoholics narcissists and abusers Hence why I don t have much contact with most of them My parents despite their struggles have been amazing and incredibly supportive of us I have always struggled with mental illness got a line of disorders under my belt but have always have supported by them I m transgender ftm somewhat alternative and very open My sister on the other hand is basic nothing wrong W that conservative hates physical touch from family only and has a completely different sense of humour She s also extremely selfish unemphatic and at times cruel She s always been very bitter toward me constantly criticizing how I am and what I do She s admitted she s embarrassed by me She doesn t share then becomes enraged when I don t either She leaves dirty dishes in shared spaces and doesn t care She has a very hard time seeing other peoples perspective and has a very just world attitude The worst part is she s incredibly disrespectful to my parents My parents spoil us in the sense that they don t ask much from us but anything they do ask of me I do She doesn t Can you do the dishes please She will wait days and days until my parents are fed up and exhausted She s condescending never seeing the big deal and thinking they re being dramatic When she gets home she immediately goes up stairs and gets annoyed when people bother her She hates favours It s always transactional I have to bribe her with money to have her help me I genuinely think she might be a narcissist but she has absolutely no idea She thinks anything that happens to her is not her fault Anyway my dad has his struggles too but I love him He s almost exactly like me and we have a very strong bond He s a joker like me so we re always goofing off But he s gone through a lot of trauma and honestly His depression seems to have gotten worse over the years It s very easy to tick him off and he catastrophes over the smallest things He has a terrible time letting things go But he s still very sweet and always apologizes after But my sister hates him Out of all of us she s especially cruel to him When we were younger she wouldn t hug him and would basically avoid him I don t know why Even now she dislikes him We had a talk in her car once and she confessed that she HATES him and doesn t like me either And it s just a natural tendency of hers She doesn t know why but she just can t stand the two of us She doesn t find us funny she doesn t get us And she knows he doesn t like her She knows he loves me more He s always been there to comfort me when I feel hurt by her because he can relate so I ve never felt alone in the situation But it s gotten so normalized that when she says something terrible we d just glance at eachother maybe smile a bit Now considering my dad s kinda lethargic he just complains about her when she s not around Calling her names just absolutely done with her shit And part of me appreciates this because my mom won t acknowledge her shitty behavior toward me and I need someone too But another part of me feels that it s wrong and that I have an obligation toward my sister I don t know I hate her She is so unbelievably cruel to me I don t even consider her my sister When I was 13 I had to force myself to lose all feelings of love toward her because her constant rejection and bitterness was destroying my mental health I just feel uncomfortable by the fact that they both hate eachother so openly and I m stuck dealing with my dad s disappointment and my sisters rage Advice would be appreciated",,Male,sibling

author: Random29225
text body: Hi I 21F have been bullied and treated poorly my whole life by my family I am the eldest child of 2 me 21F and sister 19F As a child I used to want to be friends with 19F and in all the pictures you could see it I would cuddle her and try and play with her hair and I would try and just love her eventually over time we started becoming disconnected she always wanted to be with our mum and it used to be that our dad was a very tough and strong man he was strict and taught us everything we know but we used to fear him because of that My sister when she was at home with dad and I she would be in the other room or on her device where as I used to want to watch movies with him and wanted to understand him as time went on I can see now I probably tried to hard I always wanted to be the best child I could be and I can honestly say that I tried so hard At home when I was around 11 and my sister was 9 that s when things started changing my parents would call me a liar all the time and I would rarely lie and my mum would send me to my aunts because in her words I can t deal with her but my sister would stay at home When I was supposed to go on excursions for school they would do small things like not letting me have money but letting her have money or sometimes I just wasn t allowed to go As we got into high school I distanced myself from my family I got social media and I started making friends but I was never allowed to go to party s so people slowly stopped inviting me I started to become depressed as I watched my sister go to boy girl party s and sleepovers and my parents would always tell me it s because I never got invited 1 day when I did get invited I had to take the blame for a friend for a friend when she got in trouble with a teacher and my parents stopped me from going When I met my now husband things got worse I was told that he was bad for me and that they didn t like him because he ate too much chocolate and random excuses and soon after that is when I started distancing myself even more I would spend nights at my husbands mums house when we were 17 As the years went on my parents hated that I wasn t there anymore so they offered to let me live on a granny flat on their property but that was the worst thing for me My dad made a contract that had rules for my living there I wasn t allowed my husband over at all I had to be at the house 5 nights a week I couldn t have any visitors day at the granny flat I didn t have a washing machine so I had to wait for them to be there to do it and if they went away I couldn t wash my clothes Failure to do any of these things would end up with me getting kicked out This is when I realised how controlling they were my sister meanwhile drove 2 3 hours to meet some guy who she ended up dating during this time she would never be home she would not listen to anyone but mum and dad didn t care The rules for me and the roles for her were completely different My mum and dad then wanted to open a business and offered it to my sister and he boyfriend I begged them to give me a chance and instead after about 6 months in the house they kicked me out so that my sister and her new boyfriend could move in I was sick at the time and I asked them to wait because I couldn t do it they then changed the locks through my stuff into rubbish bags and locked it in their garage saying I need to get it off them and that I am disowned because they didn t want me I got my things and left and moved in with my nana and my husband for about 6 months on and off Then as we were visiting my grandfather my mum called saying my dad passed away my husband and I drove 3 4 hours at night down to my mum my mums whole family was there and they controlled everything they didn t let my husband in with me they made me leave after a period and I had nothing to do with the funeral I also found out a bunch of dads old friends didn t even get invited to the funeral because mum didn t want to I agreed to try and help mum during this time by cleaning and doing what I can and no sooner then I arrived I got kicked out because 1 day my sister had a panic attack because I moved her washing basket into her room while I was cleaning the bathroom She ended up scratching up my arm screaming at me spitting at me and she pushed me and then as she was about get in my face I pushed her down onto her bed and told her to stop and calm down she then ran out of the house and cried hysterically in her car somewhere when I called mum it was immediately my fault and I should never have done the cleaning and I should never have spoken to her even though I was asked to clean and try and fix things with her Mum kicked me out the next week saying that I was causing too many problems I then asked her if she had noticed how this is a form of attention seeking manipulation and she told me to stop lying to make my sister seem bad and things were never like this when I was gone and I need to go I left and I haven t spoken to mum since in person and I moved away with my husband mum still screams at me over text and gets angry at me over text but I don t know what to do I ve spoken to some of dads old friends who mum was rude to and they told me they noticed the favouring of my sister over me I m honestly just exhausted Please offer any advice it would be great",21,Female,eldest child

text body: I m 22 f and my husband is a 24 m No I don t actually think we re cursed but it feels like it We got married April 26th and ever since we got married things have never gone right only wrong Not even two days after we got married my sister got into a huge argument with me my husband and my mother She was yelling at us and obviously me and my mother had no problem yelling back at her and because my husband simply raised his voice at my sister trying to defend me and my mother and it wasn t anything offensive towards her he just wanted us to stop fighting At the moment he was holding our two year old son in his left arm and all because he said something my sister went for him and physically tried to assault him while he held our son He grabbed her right wrist with his right hand and because there was a gate between them she used her left arm to try and lift herself up on the gate and the metal on top of the gate dug into her arm he never even touched her left arm because he was using his right hand to hold her right wrist and using his left arm to hold our son Thankfully she wasn t able to hit my husband or son but I did immediately yank her away from him and she turned on me and got me down on the ground before she started to punch me in the head while having a hold of my hair I tried to get her off but she s a lot bigger than me my mom tried to get her off of me but accidentally lost her flip flop in the process when she got my sister off my sister grabbed my mom s shoe that had fallen off and hit me with it in the face My mom got us separated and she was told to leave immediately The next day we did call the cops my mom had told me not to the night before because she didn t want anymore problems but I told her the next day that she needed consequences for her actions because this wasn t the first time my sister has lashed out at a family member and physically attacked someone because she lost her temper And my son could ve been hit because of her actions so that s the biggest reason I wanted to press charges and make a report We called the cops made the report and pressed charges She was arrested that same evening And don t worry it gets worse After she got arrested her boyfriend started texting my mom harassing her about how this was all her fault and she should ve never let me call the cops that because of her my sister was having to sit in jail right now And the very next day my sister wasn t even in there for a full 24 hours my grandmother bailed her out My grandmother says she isn t taking sides but she s been nothing but supportive of my sister and her crazy ass boyfriend I didn t drive anywhere the day after she got arrested but two days after she was arrested I had to go to town to run some errands and my car wouldn t start The engine wouldn t turn over but the battery life was still working even when I could get my car to start for a few seconds the engine would shake violently I called my grandfather and he came over to look at my car because the same thing was happening with my husbands car shaking engine and wouldn t hardly start We noticed that when we took the gas caps off my car and my husbands that there was a dark brown liquid around the rim there was an excessive amount We immediately began to think that my sister s boyfriend did something because this was just too much of a coinsidence that BOTH of our cars stopped working at the same time and he had already lashed out at my mom so he was clearly angry with us all for what we did My grandfather tasted the liquid around the gas caps and low and behold it was COCA COLA I tasted it myself and I felt like I was going to explode because it tasted exactly like coke and our cars were having the exact symptoms if someone were to pour coke into our fuel tanks And after my sister had been arrested her boyfriend was the only person who had actually been alone that night and lived right down the road at my grandmother s house all he had to do was walk through the patch of woods through my neighbors yard and then he d be at our house My grandmother claims that he was at his aunts house the night my sister got arrested but he could easily be lying and can t show any proof that he was actually there But also Nobody knows what time he could ve gotten there he could ve went over there for a little bit or went over there late a night after he was done tampering with our cars Sadly we don t have any cameras put up so we don t have any physical evidence to prove that it was him my husband and I live with my mom so her brand spanking new car was in the driveway same as ours And hers never got touched so we know it wasn t some teenager or else they would ve hit all three cars And nobody else in our neighborhood got touched so who else could it be Of course they re swearing up and down he didn t do it but my sister is also claiming that my husband attacked her and tried to break her arm over the gate when he had a hold of her and that she had only been pointing at him She had never tried to hit him even though we all witnessed her fist going up in the air like she was going to haymaker him So I guess we were all just imagining things Maybe she was pointing her fist up at the sky But also if my husband was the one attacking her why would I not go after him Why would I need to yank her off of him if he was the one doing the attacking And if she was hurt and scared just as much as she acts like she was why would her first response be to turn on me and start pummeling me and beating me with a freaking shoe I could ve just been trying to help her We all know she s full of it just like her boyfriend is But because neither me or my husband have a working car because the coke has completely screwed up our cars even after we tried putting Heet into the fuel tanks It s been extremely stressful between us his job has barely been giving him any hours so we barely have any income coming in and I mean like not even 100 a week kind of income Since we got married we haven t had a single night or even day to ourselves we never went on a honeymoon because we couldn t afford it and we were just gonna try and go later when we had more money We ve been fighting constantly it feels like I feel like we make each other miserable and that he doesn t want to be with me because I m hard to be around right now same for him it s been hard to deal with him because he doesn t have a stable job we have three kids to take care of he won t talk to me about his feelings We just argue and argue I don t think we ve really had a single day since we got married where we didn t argue or get into it about something And then on top of all of this my ex my two oldest sons biological father has been nothing but a dick and is threatening to get an attorney to get the kids from me even though he s the literal definition of a deadbeat the kids don t even know him really he sees them maybe once a year and doesn t ever call them He doesn t provide for them and he refuses to fill out any child support paperwork that the child support office sends him so clearly he s talking out of his ass But it s another stressful thing to add to the pile I try to focus on the good like our wonderful adorable kids but a lot of the time I just want to cry and fall apart I feel like me and my husband are going to get worse and our kids don t need to see us fighting but they do I m afraid I m losing my husband and our relationship is extremely strained right now I don t know what to do I try to be in a good mood for my kids and him but there s always something that gets to me and then ruins the day for me I have major depression disorder and borderline personality disorder along with very bad anxiety I ve tried to research what I can do to do better but something ever seems to help I ve tried therapy in the past but they don t ever seem to listen or they tell me things that I already know The last therapist said that I m a chaos seeker and I told her that at times yes I can be because that s what I ve grown up it s been nothing but drama with me and my family or me and my ex and his family at this point I don t know anything but toxic relationships and cycles I don t want that with my husband though we ve been together for four years and he truly has been the most supportive guy I ve ever met he s become a dad to my two oldest boys and we have a wonderful little boy together as well I m just scared that I m going to lose them and don t really know what to do",22,Female,Wife

text body: This is going to seem fairly minuscule so sorry for anyone with real problems I m just tired of the BS and need to vent So long story short my entire family followed me in my cross country move It hasn t been too bad having them here other than my mom but I won t get too much into that and my daughter loves having her cousin around We ve lived here about a year and a half them only about 6 months My friends that I made in that time were only work friends because if I wasn t at work I was at home with my daughter then pregnant then with both kids I have now left that job and as a lot of us know work friends are work friends So I m back to square one with no where to go with two kids and no one to talk to Turn to family right Bit of back story there I have always been there for my family and tell them they can come over whenever my daughters would love to see them They never do Well now my niece that lives with them works nights and sleeps during the day She s a heavy sleeper and if we go over my kids are usually quiet If they re too loud and causing issues we go home Tomorrow is my nephews 5th grade graduation So i thought to ask if we could come over after it was over we are going to it but it s not much of a chance to see him or anything so that my daughter could see him and he could hang out and have fun on his graduation day instead of having to be alone I was told no because it s not fair that my niece 25f btw has to sleep for work and can t have fun too so we can only now come over when she s off and can join in What But they have never once come over and hung out The few times they ve been to my house they either stay in their car outside or aren t here longer than 30 minutes I just don t get it anymore They re supposed to be family but don t ever want to see us only when I go to their house with the kids Oh and the off chance that I d need something It would just lead to them complaining and saying no I don t even ask because I know where that s going to go Sorry about the rant and if you made it this far kudos to you Just needed to write it out vent and be sad Thanks Redditers",,,parent

text body: OK I want to keep this short It will be hard But I will try My sister in law is a toxic person Basically my father in law had very unexpected and very severe health issues I think that messed my brother in law up pretty good He messed up his college career Had a weird relationship with alcohol He started dating someone several years older than him who was a bartender She got pregnant after six weeks This is now my sister in law I sound very judgmental The reason that I do is because it all started badly We had mutual friends that worked at the same bar as her and his friends advise us We should ask for a DNA test Nobody ever did It s not my place This was almost 10 years ago but things have gotten progressively worse She got in a lot of trouble with the law before we knew her and my brother in law took a personal loan out so that she could get all those debts paid off and bought a car so that she could have his old car and start driving it They got married because she needed health insurance Then since bartending was her primary income and she was pregnant she quit because she didn t want to be around cigarette smoke But she kept smoking and drinking throughout her pregnancy There have been so many ups and downs between her and I She and various family members I have no idea what their marriage is like I know all of her complaints She felt like a single parent because my brother in law had two jobs But that was so she could stay at home and be home with the kids full time Yes they did have a second one purposely The difference is between the two are very apparent The reason this is bothering me now after close to a decade is because they made several terrible decisions that are impacting us They decided to move two hours away in some show of independence The problem is they re not independent My in laws drive out there all the time So what starts out as a simple errand turns into an all day ordeal because it s a 4 Hour Dr when you look at it round trip That s taking away from so much My husband s grandparents are in their 90s and need a lot of help My mother in law still works and has to take a lot of time off My father in law gets tired very easily because of those health issues I d mentioned but they don t care My brother and sister in law don t care and my in laws don t set any boundaries I had a baby a year ago and we don t assume there will be Support but I can tell you any support we would have had is no longer available because of the time and energy and money It takes to make those four hour long trips The other thing that came to head recently is that my sister in law decided she has substance problems and went to a rehab facility for about six weeks I think it s great that you should try and fight your demons I do find it questionable that we all knew she had a dependency on alcohol but it didn t bother her until we had a baby and needed help and she thought her Support might be going out the window there s a lot of resentment all around And it s really driving me nuts Now the house they bought two hours away they cannot afford Instead of renting or moving closer to home they re going to look for a smaller home in the same school district My in laws are cosigning I need to set boundaries I need to stop being bitter and resentful I ve never felt so full of hate before And this is coming from someone who never met her father and his teenage mother abandoned her to let her grandparents raise her I ve worked my way through my demons in years of therapy Half my life I just cannot reconcile watching someone make mistakes in thinking that they re smart enough to know they re making mistakes while still making Them",,,

author: Mean_Release_143
text body: This is a long post but I feel like I need to share all of details to get advice on what to do in this current situation Ten years ago when I was twelve years old I was living in California with my mom dad brother and sister who I ll call Olivia and some of my extended family During this time period there was family drama between my mom and dad because my dad was having an affair and my parents decided to get a divorce Before I lived in California my family and I lived in Rhode Island During the summer my mom was planning on taking me and my two siblings back to Rhode Island because she thought we would be happier there since that s where I met all of my childhood friends and we could escape all of the toxic family drama associated with my father Olivia was about eighteen or nineteen during this time Before we moved though Olivia ended up not coming back to Rhode Island and instead ended up staying with my father This is also because Olivia met a guy who she was dating at the time who I thought she wanted to stay with When my mom and brother and I moved back to Rhode Island we kept in touch with Olivia We would text and call each other regularly and when I was in seventh grade I remember she came to visit us during my winter break around christmas time and she came to visit again during the summer and the next summer after that when I was about to go into high school After the last time that she came to visit things became more distant between us I remember the last time she came to visit my mom and Olivia would get into arguments and not get along When I was in high school things became more distant between Olivia and the rest of our family We would try and reach out to her by calling and texting her and it got to a point where I would only rarely hear back from her The more time went on the less and less she would talk to us I would send her text messages and call her and she would rarely answer My mom told me that one time it got to a point where my father felt like he had to call the police to check up on Olivia and apparently during this time she said that she doesn t want anything to do with her family My aunt and my grandmother were also very concerned since Olivia wasn t talking to them either and she s usually very close with them One time I remember when we talked on the phone I asked her why she won t talk to mom and why she s been so distant She told me that she feels resentment towards my mother because of stuff that she did to Olivia in the past but when I tried to ask Olivia what she was talking about she wouldn t tell me and that it was just between her and my mother About six months ago some things happened with Olivia and her boyfriend who she was with for nine years and eventually she ended up moving back to the east coast to live with my mother and I During the time that she s been living here I ve noticed that Olivia seems different When we saw each other six months ago when she came back it was the first time we had seen each other in seven years Things were very awkward at first and she seemed different One time Olivia and I had a talk and she feels like we abandoned her She also expressed this to my mother when she came back When we talked about this Olivia said that my mother never asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with my mom my brother and I Olivia said that she talked about this with my mom and my mom says that she did ask Olivia if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us but Olivia insists that my mom was gaslighting her and that she never asked her if she wanted to move back to Rhode Island Olivia basically thinks that we just decided to move to Rhode Island I also talked to my mom about this and my mom says that she asked Olivia if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us and according to my mom Olivia said that she didn t want to come because she didn t like Rhode Island Olivia said that us moving to Rhode Island happened so suddenly which I don t remember because I knew that we were moving back to Rhode Island during that year before the summer started and I knew that she must have known something about way before then since me and my family members were all talking about it I remember when we talked about this that Olivia also admitted that when she came to visit when I was in middle school that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back and live with us and Olivia said that she felt like this was manipulation so she turned the offer down I just don t understand Olivia s logic behind this So she wished that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island and then when my mom finally asks her to come move in was it somehow manipulation My mother also doesn t see how we abandoned her because when I was in high school she says that we did nothing but keep in touch with Olivia and that we even sent her gifts during the pandemic and we let her come visit during the times I mentioned previously My mom doesn t see how we abandoned her when she feels like we did nothing to keep Olivia in our lives while we were apart What really bugged me during my and Olivia s conversation is that when I told her that I tried to text and call her while we were apart she said that she doesn t care about a call or a text and that she wanted to see me I feel like that s unfair because I don t see how she expects me to make plans to see her if she just decided to disappear and not respond to messages How else did she want me to communicate with her when we were across the country from each other I feel like that s also unfair of her to say that because I was twelve years old when all of that happened and I was a literal child too so I feel like I didn t really have much of a say in the matter My choices were to either go with my mom or to stay with my dad who was literally cheating on my mom at the time and was a toxic person to be around The way I see it I didn t really have much of a choice I just feel like the distance between our relationship isn t my fault given the circumstances at the time Lately since Olivia has been back I am always feeling like there is tension in the house Olivia just comes and goes and barely speaks to anybody and just goes off to our room by herself and rarely comes out I ve been home from college recently and she s hardly said anything to me Yesterday my mom and Olivia got into a heated argument because my mom who has been dealing with this everyday since Olivia got back What happened was my mom was trying to have a conversation with her about why she barely talks to anybody and what s going on with her and Olivia just blatantly walked away from her while my mother was talking to her My mom lost her patience and went into our room to confront Olivia and they both got into a heated argument Today I mentioned to my mom about how Olivia and I were having a conversation and she said that she tried to call me back multiple times while I was away at college this semester and that I didn t call her back I told her that I was busy with school and I was also really busy with making a short film that I wrote and directed She then said Well you tried to call mom while you were gone so that excuse isn t going to work When I mentioned this to my mom my mom was upset about that because she felt like Olivia was bullying me and that her behavior was manipulative I said that by her tone of voice that it sounded like Olivia said this in jest but my mom said that you don t need to have a certain tone and that Olivia was trying to make me feel like I did something wrong even though I didn t and that I really don t owe here an explanation My sister is staying with us right now and in two months she s leaving to go to boot camp for the army I m just not sure what to feel about this and I am not sure what to do about this whole situation TL DR Olivia has been distant between us and she recently moved back from California to live with me and my mother There has been tension between her and my mother and the rest of us I am not sure how to feel about this or what to do",22,,sibling

text body: btw I ve posted this story on different communities to get other answers and a better chance for a response I 15 F really want to know what to do or if someone else has another experience like this because I m really struggling My dad is normally a nice person though sometimes he doesn t listen or ignores people which I m not sure why he s just always been that way But anyways every few months sometimes both my parents get into a fight over something and 100 of the time it s something stupid because of my dad Thats not the bad part i understand many arguments happen in relationships but the thing with my dad is from days to weeks after an argument with my mom he s just full on an asshole I can t talk to him without him flipping out over some random shit that shouldn t make anyone angry in the first place Don t get me wrong my dad has never hit me my sister or my mom but during arguments he has tendencies to start to throw things around the room like a child It genuinely upsets me He recognizes that he has anger issues and he even went to couples therapy with my mom but it just feels like he keeps getting angry over nothing During his angry episodes he barely cracks a smile for literally weeks and its borderline disturbing its like hes looking for something to get mad at I really want to leave the house but I m too young and I only graduate highschool in 3 years My sister is gonna leave for college soon and i dont know what i m going to do without her shes the only person who really stands up to him Hes in one his angry episodes right now and im genuinely scared to even look at him in the eye or hes gonna suddenly flip out over something My mom never stands up to him and just sleeps in the guest room during his angry episodes Can anyone tell me what I can do because his anger issues are worsening my depression and i dont think I deal with him anymore",15,Female,Daughter

text body: I need some advice I am a teen struggling with mental health and something very triggering happened today that might not seem like a huge thing to people on the outside I m not sure So at dinner my mom was really getting on my sisters case for taking one of her stickers off her my sisters water bottle My sister started to get overwhelmed and stuff and my mom got very confused So I explained that it seemed kind of combative so my sister got overwhelmed She took a lot of offense with that and got super defensive She then started taking her anger out on me I m not going to get into all the details but basically at some point she said oh you wanna say smth now And I was like what I wasn t going to say anything Then she was like I SAW YOU ABOUT TO SAY SMTH And some of my fam was like no she wasn t And she was like I SAW HER OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE And I said mom just trust me I wasn t going to say anything And then I said remember when you told me you don t like it when I assume things of you I promise I wasn t going to and I d like you to trust me on that She got SUPER angry at that and was oh no you don t Like I was back talking her Eventually she went upstairs and I was very distraught and confused so I asked my dad what happened so I could see if and what I needed to apologize for and he was like I m not getting into this And then she heard and started yelling and saying WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND FINISH YOUR DINNER My dad had already excused me and so I said I was full Then she said NO YOURE NOT GO FINISH YOUR DINNER EAT NUTRITIONALLY Which really hurt because I told her before that those specific kinds of comments make me feel really bad about my body and I purposefully don t eat after that And she yelled it too so that made it worse For context I regularly eat healthy and then I started crying because of it and my dad was trying to calms her down and then she yelled IM SICK OF HER GASLIGHTING ME And then I started bawling I don t know why the gaslighting bit affected me so much",,Female,daughter

text body: This is going to be a long post and I will also spare details since its so long I 21f think my aunt 40 and uncle 42 have no remorse for the actions they took against my sister 26 My uncle let s call him james reposted a hurtful post on Facebook against the Trans community My sister let s call her Emma called him out in his comment section when my uncle replied to another commenter that seemed to be upset by my uncle s original post The comment said I ve never pushed my belief onto you I d just hoped you would respects me my uncle replied to that comment saying something along the lines of I know and I have I just mean the people who claim to have xxyy123 chromosomes in other words my uncle only thinks people with xx and xy chromosomes exist My sister Emma responded to my uncles comment saying so this mindset applies to your niece meaning my younger sister who has turners syndrome which means her chromosomes are xo and not fitting my uncles norm My uncle and sister then had a long text chain of comments trying to prove eachother wrong My aunt lets call her sarah then texted my sister a long ass text along the lines of how dare you call your sister trans if you are struggling with your sexuality are you gonna cheat on your husband and the big kicker Lastly thank you for supporting my ex husband who was abusive and cheated on me with another man and put a gun up to my head I find it interesting that my aunt sarah thinks my sister would ever support an abusive asshole just because emma believes that everyone has the right to love who they want regardless Its clear my aunt sarah has not been to enough therapy if any at all My uncle posted about 150 hurtful posts against people who have mental issues people who are liberals people in the LGBT community and more all within the month of April 2025 Then my aunt and uncle decide to post passive aggressive posts on facebook against my sister and roped the rest of the family into basically hating and making fun of my sister and her husband since my brother in law decided to stick up for his wife All of this mind you my sister had struggled with depression since she was 16 and if she wasnt in a good place right now she could have ended her life because of the constant hurt they were doing towards her My brohter in law called my uncle an idiot for supporting RFK and the things he said about autism because my uncle had an autistic kid and cant see the possible harm of the registry My brother in law said your and idiot instead of using the correct you re which made my uncle laugh at him for his grammar when my uncle misspells indeed he thinks its two words as well as misuses the theres all the time Just a hypocrit My dad then calls my uncle because they are brothers and tries to get my uncle to understand what he did was wrong by asking If this situation had happened to his own children how would he have felt My uncle respoded with if my kids came out as any part of the LGBT they would be kicked out of the house My dad also said the reason my aunt sarah broke her arm was because of karma That comment most likely got back to my aunt from my uncle because after my dad hung up of his brother my aunt completely blocked me and the rest of my siblings on Facebook when her beef is with Emma and my dad To this day my uncle still is posting shit like that and the only person we talk to on my dad s side of the family now is my dad s other brother who is being Switzerland right now My family doesn t blame my other uncle because we wouldn t want him to lose his family for something he didn t do Ask any questions and I ll try and answer them as best as I can",21,Female,

text body: A while back I was in a physical altercation with my stepfather It s something that s been replaying in my head constantly and I m having a really hard time processing it Physically there were moments he got the upper hand he ended up on top of me for maybe 10 seconds then shoved me across the floor and walked away I wasn t seriously hurt but I did get a small bruise near my eye I managed to land one solid punch earlier in the fight that definitely caught him off guard but I didn t follow up with more and I ve been stuck with regret about not doing more My goal at the time wasn t to really hurt him I wanted to get away Emotionally I feel like I failed because I didn t win in a more obvious way But part of me knows that not escalating further and standing up to him at all was already something important I feel ashamed angry and disappointed in myself It s like no matter how many people tell me I held my own or did well my mind keeps telling me I lost or that I didn t do enough There s a constant sense of unfinished business and I hate how small and powerless it makes me feel I keep wondering if I should have hit back harder gotten up faster or done something more decisive It s exhausting How do you come to terms with a fight like this where you didn t lose badly but also didn t feel like you dominated How do you know what parts really mattered Fortunately he is out of my life snd we don t talk at all There is a lot more to this situation but this is the gist of it",,,stepchild

author: Scary_Building_6078
text body: Disclaimer i know this is long scroll to TLDR to skip backstory My older half sister is 33 and still lives with our parents Me 20 F still also live with my parents However she s 33 with a full time job and my parents by this i mean 100 my mom don t ask her to pay a DIME no rent no bills NOTHING The only thing she does is work I am a full time student in nursing school with 2 part time jobs I have busted my ass to get scholarships and get loan forgiveness through my school in return to work for them after graduation All because I never wanted my parents to stress about adding another bill like my school tuition I ve been a full time college student straight out of high school and they have never had to pay a penny for my tuition And yet she says she has no money and is broke all the time to my parents and us My mom has even given her money when she says she is going out with her now ex boyfriend That makes me incredibly angry she takes advantage of my mom s pitty for her and shields her from the rest of us who see things how they are Now this is not the only reason I heavily dislike my older sister just because i don t want to use hate but now i think i do for a lot of reasons I met her when i was 8 when she came from mexico after my grandma passed who she lived with and at first it was great and so cool to have an older sister that soon faded like very quickly She would just straight up bully me and try to discipline me when my parents weren t home and she was supposed to watch me like hit me and slap me when they weren t home and not in a playful way I never said anything because i didn t want to cause problems and i was just a quiet shy kid all around At the time we had a family friend who lived in an extra room and he witnessed her slap me and was the one who alerted my parents When confronted she got out of it saying she just wanted to go back to Mexico because she wasn t welcomed here In which my mom just begged her to stay Since then she s always been bitter and purposely doing things to me in which i grew to really not speak to her or interact with her i ve only really stuck up for myself a few times when she was being out loud and direct but most of the time she just does things to get a reaction out of me My mom always complains how she hates that we don t get along and says I just don t like her We ve talked plenty of times and her response is you just have to understand she was raised by my mom and i think she just wants to be more like you and the life you had remember her dad never spoke to her and it s just a lot in which I always say im not going to going to feel pitty for her and excuse her behavior because of it My mom hates it because she says we only have each other here and she doesn t know what will happen when she dies On a separate occasion she has told my younger sister full sister 13 when speaking about me that she resents me because my mom left her and came to a different country when she was 12 and then got pregnant with me Now it s not like I had the best childhood ever in fact it was far from good because my parents worked day and night and i spent most of my time with a babysitter who would discipline kids physically As well as having to immediately kill my childhood when my mom left for her took her 7 months to come back because my little sister was 1 year old and my dad couldn t handle us both so I learned how to take care of her from showering changing diapers feeding everything while we weren t with our babysitter But they worked so much because my mom would send so much money to my grandma for her She was put on a pedestal by my grandma and spoiled so i m confused at how she resents me when i didn t do anything but just live i guess Here s where my absolute hatred begins I ve been gay for a long time since I was in middle school and she never really said anything about it I ve been dating my gf for over 2 years and everything was fine she just said hi or casual conversation Theres been some recent incidents where she had taken her keys and gone out in someone else s car and block in my gf to where she couldn t leave and her excuse being i thought she was spending the night she left at 8pm with her car keys even though she wasn t taking her car and my gf only spends the night on holidays where she will drink something so that was just bizarre weird behavior On top of other petty incidents we like to think she s just weird and jealous for example I like hello kitty i have a lot do hello kitty things and my gf buys me a lot of hello kitty things for the last few years my hello kitty collection has grown and then a few months ago out of no where she added a hello kitty bumper sticker to her car and some to her bare stanley i thought oh okay weird but whatever she s been on and off with a man for about 2 years and he genuinely does not like her it s very obvious but that s a different story Last week she claims they broke up indefinitely this time so she apparently has way too much time on her hands TLDR She doesn t go out with any friends or anything of the sorts and i can see why but yesterday we were invited to a wedding in which my mom told me to bring my gf my younger sister who also doesn t really like her because of her weird activity and me and her are very close Before leaving my mom says oh we re gonna need 2 cars because we won t all fit I just said okay i ll drive my car and drive us Since i m not close enough my older sister says ooh alicia s my gf just gonna drive herself in which i m like um no she s not i just said i m driving us she didn t say anything and just walked to the car My little sister saw my irritation and got in the car with me and my gf everything was fine after until it wasn t At the party i sat on the same side of the table as her but with a empty chair in between my gf sister and i just being dumb and bored were making random jokes about nothing in particular and just laughing nothing very sneaky or suspicious just talking I think nothing of this me and my gf get up to throw our food plates away and see if we want any dessert on our way back to our table i notice her taking a video of us not very secretly playing it off like she s on her phone I thought maybe I was just paranoid or something when i go to sit and i glance and she s just sitting on facebook and puts her phone down I continue doing my thing about 15 minutes later i notice her trying to turn her phone screen while texting which makes me think she doesn t want me to see so i just look away until i catch something that looks familiar out of the corner of my eye She s on whatsapp texting someone and sending pictures of me and my gf standing and talking followed by a video of us walking towards the table I play closer attention and she opens her gallery to attach more and more pictures of us pop up I m trying to get a better look but am too far to see what she s saying I can only see a few chat logs in response with laughing emojis and text I immediately am filled with rage and i look over to my gf to tell her she s like weird bitch oh my god what s her problem my little sister notices my face and asks what happened my gf tells her and she looks confused and mostly in disbelief i tell her to come sit next to me to get a better look so she comes and sits in between us i play it off saying the light is in her eye when she moves because my mom asks Older sister is still oblivious and continues to text my little sister then text me I can t understand what she s saying because it s in spanish she s not a great spanish reader but it says something about being gay This just makes it worse and in the moment i want to grab her and drag her outside My gf tried to calm me down and i can just feel my body heat raising so i try to calm down because i know she s not worth it i text my dad who also dislikes her because of how she acts and my mom babying her and tell him she took pics and vids of us and is sending them to someone he tells me to tell my mom so i text her as well we re all at the same table im very visibly angry and upset i watch her read it and got upset a few minutes later she tells her go outside with her I begin to talk to them about it when they leave including my dad and he just agrees with me I m very angry and i think she s genuinely a bitter ugly jealous person and needs to pick a struggle I start making jokes about how if she really wanted a picture of us that bad she could ve just asked us and we could ve posed or done something else just to calm me down from knocking her teeth out outside About 7 minutes go by and they come back and there chatting like normal I spend the rest of the night not looking at her or ignoring her which was already what i was doing but I know this will be talked about when my mom realizes i won t be speaking to her anymore under any circumstances",20,Female,sister

wanted to rant about this he often thinks the world is against him he takes everything out on everyone else in the family and blames everything on us as well today it was my sisters graduation and he wasnt allowed to go because whenever he goes somewhere with everyone he tends to have breakdowns and manages to make it about himself all the time and obviously it s a big day so nobody wanted that i stayed home since i didn t wanna bring the mood down cause i honestly just listen to music stay quiet i might have personal problems too cause i get a bit upset when people try to talk to me in public TT not the point though anyway my brother was home too and i heard him yell a couple times and heard some noises in my moms room i went out to feed my dog and i saw a few things scattered on the living room floor an armrest that i thought was my moms chairs it wasnt but i assumed he did something in my moms room assumption was right LOL he knocked down a lot of stuff in my moms room and was blasting music in his room sorry for the off topic but he s completely unhygenic and does not clean his room tbh my mom has catered to him his whole life and she still cleans it because it gets so bad okay back on topic i told my mom and she came home an hour or two later since it still was my sisters graduation they went shopping my mom and brother were arguing a bit ago i think his reasoning was because he doesn t have friends and can t go anywhere something about being a mistake too LMAO he s online schooled because he can t control his tongue in public he has no friends because he f cks his friends gfs and he s a mistake because he can t do anything for himself he s CAPABLE to get a job he can drive too but he refuses sorry needed to clock that if we re completely honest hes just an ASSHOLE first encounter with the police he asked my sister to take a pic of him in the cop car got put into the mental hospital maybe 3 times he may have been kind the few weeks after but it did not last long he boasts about wanting reassurance my mom tries to give it to him he cant accept it don t act like you care he says he gets EVERYTHING HE WANTS if he throws a tantrum he gives my mom so much stress and i just feel horrible no one else really has breakdowns like this so she obviously has no experience with dealing with this gosh he thinks everyone can do everything for him the pointless arguments end in him slamming his door screaming you don t understand me and blasts music about the physical breakdown theres multiple but the most recent one was with my sister it starts out with him being on the phone with his ex screaming and begging to take him back or something how low can you go and he was so loud my mom cut off his line and so he banged on my sisters door telling her to call mom to turn it back on she said no obviously and he kept on banging she opened the door and he was screaming at her more only repeating call mom and she was screaming to get tf out duhh anyway he broke a bowl that was on her dresser and she says that he tried to swing but i didnt see and sadly i doubt that LOL sorry sis also i didnt see because i was in my room cause i had just woke up to this sh t anyway well he spits on her and stuff she punches him and he holds her down on her bed i heard her yell get off of me so i jumped out of bed lmao and started slapping his back and he eventually got off my mom turned his line back on and he backed off and started begging his ex again my mom dad did nothing about this atleast i don t recall he laughed about it Psychopath literally lets see another breakdown with him maybe two three years ago i had a heart problem and was going to get surgery a little soon it was late at night and he was knocking on my door asking for my vr headset because he needed to play something i said no though things couldve ended quicker if i just gave it but he was Nasty and i mean it I MEAN IT so i repeatedly said no and he was just saying the meanest stuff like i hope your surgery doesn t go well so i can just take the vr for myself as he kept banging eventually he was starting to take my doorknob off as i tried so hard to hold the door closed i was scared i tried calling my mom dad from their room and on the phone too but they didnt respond he took my doorknob off and took the vr and i just sat there sobbing my eyes out he sees me as weak and incapable of doing anything so he didn t care about me crying also to be honest i didnt want him to hate me and call me a baby for calling my parents so i think i stopped after a bit i think he felt bad and put my doorknob back gave the vr back but gosh that was the worst experience i can t even trust him i came out to him months ago too and he doesnt use my respected pronouns atleast he hasnt outted me yet though lol i really dont know how much longer i can take this and based off the physical interaction its going to get worse from here i hate him so much i m sorry but i wish he wasnt my brother i would give anything for him to really love me and i get told that he does love me and he cares then why am i treated so cruelly i feel unsafe around him",,,sibling

text body: Disclaimer I have horrible memory Some information may be missing in the descriptions of what happened because I simply don t remember which might make the situation sound a bit weird Also lowkey long post Hello Before I explain the situation I want to explain my family dynamic just a little bit I also apologize if anything is explained weirdly if I begin rambling or over explaining I m just trying to not miss out on any details that might be helpful I 16 F am the oldest child of a family with three children My bio siblings are 14 F and freshly 13 F I used to have a very strained relationship with both of my parents especially when puberty first hit and around the time I was diagnosed with depressive episodes but we re mostly neutral getting better now My relationship with my bio siblings is hard to describe it changes up a lot of the time This post is about my youngest bio sibling the freshly 13 y o who we ll call Alex As background on Alex they were an early bloomer in things of puberty and they atleast used to I don t know if they still do look up to me a lot and copy a lot of the things I do I m assuming this lead them to think they re mature for their age and should be allowed the things I am allowed even though they quite literally were 12 up until a few days ago My parents share this assumption Example for this is hair dye I began dyeing my hair when I was 13 almost 14 I dyed it red with Henna and kept that and black until I was 15 that is when I began using bleach and doing more funky colors Alex began using bleach at 12 even after my mother said multiple times that she doesn t even like me using bleach she doesn t want a 12 y o to bleach their hair They have a tendency to just disappear from home for hours without telling anyone where they re going and then returning at past 10PM or just not keeping to set return times in general one time we called the police to report them as missing because they didn t come back after having supposedly gone to training only for them to show up at nearly 11PM on a weekday after having skipped training to go to a queer meet up at a local bar My parents always get very frustrated when things like that happen or when they steal money or break any other rule because they don t know what to do Because how do you show a 12 year old that their actions have consequences They already barely have their phone tablet because of their many f ups because that s the only thing my parents can actually enforce If they grounded Alex they d just not come home directly after school and they also don t actually want to ground anyone Besides Alex has a massive screentime problem anytime they don t have their phone they go running around desperately to find something they can go online with I ve seen them open Instagram over out TV or the laptop we use for school work One time they brought a school ipad home and spent the entire night on it and when my mother found out and told them to give it back they didn t and instead hid it outside and then got it once my mother thought they d given it back Now what actually made me write about all this is something that happened this evening after dinner My parents sat us down to talk about screentime and the topic of Alex s screentime came up again My parents criticized them for being on their phone so much and letting it distract them from schoolwork which is causing them to possibly not even get into the next grade There was a fight I don t remember about what exactly most likely about limiting Alex s screentime more While my father and they were discussing that my mother had gone upstairs to get me pain meds I had asked for them because of period cramps My mother keeps the pain meds in the same place as our lunch money and when she came back downstairs she was pissed because someone had stolen nearly half of next week s lunch money Alex is the only possible suspect my father has no reason to take our lunch money and would ve said something my other bio sibling earns her money by doing small tasks for our mother and is just the golden child who would never do that in general and I don t even know where the money and meds are kept and I also have enough money of my own so Alex is the only possible person who could have taken it They absolutely snapped when my mother confronted them and got up to run upstairs while screaming and crying My mother was standing in the doorway they had to take and when she tried talking to them when they passed They punched her My mother is shocked at them using violence against her and my jaw actually just dropped when I saw that I want to make clear that my parents are not physically abusive before anyone starts that theory They re not the greatest emotionally and have said questionable things but other than rare play fights there has never been physically violence in our house I don t know where this came from and I don t know how to handle it or how to handle Alex in general I know that I m not their mother and I shouldn t concern myself with that too much but I still do and I know that it might be puberty but puberty isn t a reason for physically assaulting a parent What do you do with a kid who does that Where did that even come from To everyone who read until here thank you so much I m so sorry if anything was unclear I ll answer any questions that come up as good as I can Have a good day night whatever",16,Female,sibling
1054,Letter to my father,"title: Letter to my father
author: Advanced-cat-brain
text body: Letter to My Father I don t know where to start since I know you won t read this letter But in another life maybe you wouldn t even have needed a letter to be a better father I already wrote you one when I was 9 years old after you broke several pieces of furniture that my mother had bought just because you had forgotten where you put your wallet and we weren t much help But all you did after reading it was yank me violently Then you just sat there as if nothing had happened I know it s impossible to make you see reason to show you how much of a bad father you were But I also know that communication has never been a solution with you When we lived with you you kept talking about how many sacrifices you made for us but did you ever wonder if that wasn t simply the normal price to pay when you choose to bring life into the world I never asked to be born In fact I would ve said no if I had known you would be my father What a misfortune You never sacrificed your anger issues You came home scaring everyone woke us up in the middle of the night to look for your things when you lost them punished us by locking the house to stop us from going to school if we didn t do what you wanted You yelled at us in front of our friends and neighbors you hit our mother in front of us and threatened to do the same to us if we didn t obey you But the question is why Why did you feel the need to make us suffer Why did you never show us how a loving father treats his family And finally why do you never remember or speak of any of it It s ironic how I still watch videos about gentle parenting and cry I talk about you to my friends and they never laugh when I try to turn my trauma into jokes I used to hear family members say At least your father doesn t smoke or drink But why would a loving father who smokes or drinks be worse At least he s only harming his own health not others I convinced myself that maybe you deserved a little love because you never sexually assaulted us But how sad it is to have to use that as a threshold for abuse I tried everything with you I tried obeying ever since I was 3 years old when I realized you broke things when you were angry I obeyed cleaned up after you didn t cry in front of you because I knew it would make you scream at my mother And I waited until I was 9 when my mother decided we had to move in with you because of her work after discovering you were cheating on her But things got worse too many debts we never benefited from too many outbursts and too many changes You stayed angry Every time you came home from work I had stomachaches from anxiety Everything had to be arranged your way or all hell would break loose And the next day I had to lie to my friends to explain the shouting and fighting in our apartment At 13 I d had enough I started defending myself verbally I was tired of being the slave of the one who was supposed to protect me But it only made your behavior worse Everything became unbearable when my mother left and I lived alone with you and my little sister I felt like we didn t experience things the same way because I m much more sensitive That year was the worst You made me prefer death over obeying you You stopped me from sleeping and seemed to take pleasure in it You walked me to school with a stick in your hand like I was livestock You starved me for days to the point where I had to ask my friends for food Why Because I didn t help clean the house Because I didn t wake up in time for school So I started defending myself physically but you were stronger and I was judged for it Even my mother judged me She once said I ve seen all kinds of difficult children but I ve never seen one hit their father But is it normal to see your father hit your mother and never react Is it normal to be locked up the night before an exam and have to push him away to escape Is it normal that no one judged him when he hit me in the face on my birthday When he slapped me because I wasn t walking fast enough behind him When he beat me for arguing with my sister All of this is normal but I m the one who should be ashamed Even in religion I was forced to ask his forgiveness when I defended myself because I was afraid of going to hell I kissed his hands like a slave every day from the time I was 3 until I left Morocco But I hated it I couldn t not do it or he would make the day worse I hated you but you were pitiful always talking about how people ruined your life about your unfulfilled dreams You talked so much that I ended up feeling sorry for you So now the question is what do I want from you Well nothing for myself because you ve already destroyed my childhood The only thing I want is for you to treat my mother and little sister well Either you change and become a good father for the years you have left or if you stay violent mentally and physically then go as far away as possible and never come back This letter could have been read by you if you were a reasonable person But you re not and that s sad for both of us With all my regrets Your child",13,,child

text body: I have slowly but surely emerged from a series of realisations over the last few months years an emotional spring clean if you want Job 1 completed realising that my mates were just abusing me emotionally having previously financially abused me spending years conning me with poker out of a rigged deck Reconnected with some older friends and started making new ones where I now live Now I ve come to the realisation that whilst I love my mother as she creeps further into her old age currently in her mid 70s the more and more I dislike her For instance yesterday travelled 5 hours to see her and take her for lunch and to suggest a new car she might like before her existing one explodes and is worth nothing which I have no doubt it will and frustratingly she had already dismissed it before we got to the showroom now she wouldn t say why but 100 it s because she considers Renault s poor people cars it s not a BMW so it s not good enough Then she said she did like an older 3 series or a an Audi TT totally missing the point that I m trying to future proof her save her money and that she s had a hip replacement done so maybe a low to the ground bone shaker like a TT is probably not the best idea Either way as the above example shows she s very materialistic and as she gets older is turning into a nightmare At some point I m going to have to take control but how do you deal with someone like that I m 99 sure she hates the fact I ve been with my partner for a decade and have 4 step kids and won t be giving her her own grandchild It s so infuriating",,,child

text body: What would you do Me and my child s father were never in a relationship we casually slept together and hung out for around 2 years Around the time we stopped sleeping together I found out I was around 15 weeks pregnant at the time he had slept with once his good friend and employee s very recent ex girlfriend He wanted me to have a termination but due to how far along the pregnancy was I decided against it he decided to pursue a relationship with the new woman at this time Here where things get a bit f cked so obviously we are talking about the pregnancy and scheduling in missed appointments to catch things up since finding out late ect he tells me after him and the new girlfriend have been together less than 3 weeks that I need to start including her in the pregnancy ect because she s going to be the step mum naturally this annoys and disgusts me I always knew the guy was immature but I really didn t think he would be this complacent about his own child s safety I told him that I understood we will both have new relationships at so stage in our lives and our son will evidently meet new partners but that it needs to be something we discuss and set healthy boundaries around I told him that if he and his girlfriend were still together in 12 months that we would look at her meeting and spending time with the baby given he wasn t even born yet His obsession with this new girlfriend being the child s step mum is a very toxic situation and I wouldn t have my guard up so much if it wasn t for the fact that I know about her past I was seeing my baby s father and she was seeing his friend so we were associated as a friendship group which I why I know that she struggles immensely with depression anxiety and likely other mental health conditions She attempted to commit suicide on two occasions that I know of and would self harm every time she drinks alcohol almost daily basis at the time of her previous relationship Now that my son is 3 months old it s been nothing but an inconsiderate insensitive time where his father is more concerned with his girlfriend being involved than he is even being involved in his sons life himself Now knowing all of this I m so scared to eventually have to leave my vulnerable child with him and this person not knowing if she will suffer a mental episode while caring for him hurt him and who s knows what it s made me so stressed about the entire situation His entire family seem to encourage his dysfunctional behaviour and support the narrative of this woman being the step mother and them both having care of the child as soon as the court will allow them to which is even more distressing for me as his mother I am completely alone without any family nearby they are in a different state My sons father hasn t once helped with an overnight helped his his sons colic episodes helped me with any house work baby s needs nothing How would you navigate this situation I m so sick to my stomach with the whole thing Advice",,Female,mother

text body: I have a 12 year old daughter and for a long time I ve suspected she has ADHD She struggles to follow instructions especially if she s given more than one at a time She often zones out becomes easily frustrated or angry and takes a very long time to complete even simple tasks She doesn t respond well to criticism and has a hard time expressing her emotions After finally getting her evaluated she was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse I want to start her on the medication to help her succeed and feel more in control but my husband her father is completely against it He doesn t believe anything is wrong with her and is deeply concerned about the risks especially knowing that Vyvanse is a stimulant and can be addictive if not used properly What makes this even harder for me is that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child too I was prescribed medication but my mother chose not to give it to me That decision had a lasting impact on my life it caused me years of struggle confusion and missed opportunities I don t want my daughter to go through the same pain I did I want her to have the support and tools I didn t get But now I feel stuck between doing what I believe is best for her and trying to respect my husband s fears and perspective Do I give her the medication or do I continue trying to convince my husband",,Female,mother

text body: I ve never posted on Reddit before but I just need to know if my discomfort about this is valid or stupid So my mom F48 has always been very open and comfortable about the topic of sex and sexuality to me F16 She used to walk around naked a lot and would make fun of me when I told her it made me uncomfortable however when I was about 14 15 she finally stopped When I was about 8 she told me she has a foot fetish and still makes comments about people s feet and jokes about sexual stuff involving feet sometimes It s always weirded me out a lot not to shame fetishes but I just DO NOT need to know that about my mom She also always makes jokes about my sex life whether it s been existent or not Like when I had a boyfriend at 13 she dropped me off and said to him use a condom in the first interaction they had even though we were never even close to doing anything like that I ve always been very uncomfortable talking about anything sexual especially with her and I think it s because she s made it kind of an uncomfortable thing and gone too far in my opinion Earlier today I told her she was giving rebellious teenage girl vibes when talking to her boyfriend and then she referred to him as daddy right in front of me because of that It made me grossed out but they both were acting like it was usual and I m the one who started it with my comment I know my mom has good and playful intentions and is a great person And I m also completely fine with my friends talking to me about sexual things I just feel very uncomfortable and weird about the things my mom has said and done but i know she doesn t understand why and thinks I m just being a prude Does she have a point or is she taking things too far It s hard because the story is coming from my side but I m trying not to embellish or change any real details to keep it fair Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this 3",16,Female,daughter

text body: I know this is a long ass post I don t expect everyone to read it But I need to get it out of my head I want to forget about everything they did and kept me from doing But I m still paying for their arrogance and stupidity at 24 I ve lost countless opportunities for a life worth living Because of my father mother older brother and sister I ve been off adderall for 5 years I ve quit smoking weed at least 4 times Things are rough but I m still trying to do better This post is to vent If you want to start a fight I bet there s a subreddit just for that Memories from when I was a kid keep me up at night Still trying to understand how people could be so stupid I still rely on meds to get decent sleep The earliest I remember was a bad trip to Disney when I was 6 My brother sister and dad bullying me for only being tall enough to ride the plane Height restrictions are common knowledge But that wasn t even considered before spending thousands on a trip that not all of their children could enjoy That instance sticks with me Because it sums up my whole relationship with them And They homeschooled me until 6th grade I never found out why But beef has always fucked with my stomach That was my dad s favorite food So when I told him that going to bed hungry was better than eating what he made He left marks that lasted weeks He d make me go without any food at all for days at a time When people asked why I hadn t eaten or wasn t ALLOWED to eat at a public event He d just say I was picky and hard headed And people left it alone Despite the fact that I look like a corpse in every childhood photo My stomach is still the size of a child s Both parents are dangerously arrogant My dad would spend all day getting pissed at everyone else to come home and take it out on a 5 4 woman and his own kids Without a drop of alcohol My mom had been cheating since I was in middle school and thinks she can tell others who to date My mother was a special kind of stupid She s never paid a bill in her life But when my brother or sister were practicing for their sports or attending their clubs I d be in the car with her Hearing her scream so loud about how expensive their activities were that it echoed My skin was always red itching and burning from the soap and detergent she bought And she d just scream at me for being a baby When I was 11 My dad got me paternity tested Because the son of a civil engineer can t flunk a math test He ll never admit it But there s only one thing he would ve actually wanted to know from a blood drawing After that every grade below C got me dragged back the hall to get my ass beat Carpet burns on my ankles and shins And some marks that are still visible in my twenties He would even wait an hour and then pull me into the bathroom to check me for bruises so that he could tell me how I really got them My 11th birthday was the worst one I ve had I only had 3 friends I could invite We had a pretty good time playing DS and Wii But 3 of us had the DS Lite One had the DSi That uses a different charger that he left at home When his started to die my father learned of the problem and pinned me to the wall by my neck It took all of my friends and my older brother telling him we didn t have the charger to save me from suffocating I woke up later than all of my friends the morning after They d gone outside while I was pouring my cereal My dad walked into the kitchen saw me by myself and without saying anything started dragging me back the hall While I m yelling I have to eat When we got back to his room he literally threw me on the floor I got back up and told him I had to eat again And he belted my face so hard I thought I d lost my nose He proceeded to mark up my whole body while screaming about me being a failure My friends saw the marks And were visibly shocked But nobody said anything He told me I wouldn t remember that night for the fun I had but for the pain I endured And credit where it s due That s the one time he told me the truth But it beats my 10th birthday Where I asked to go to a superhero movie my parents didn t approve of For trying to argue my case to them I was sitting alone in a chair in the middle of our living room And told I d get my ass beat if I got up When I was 12 I wanted to join the basketball team Both of my parents went apeshit over march madness every year So you d think they d at least get me the physical but no I begged until I cried They did end up dragging me to the doctors office for The physical I needed so badly But signups had been closed for weeks I argued my case the year after but my brother piped up out of nowhere Without them telling him it s not his business and said verbatim Basketball is for pretty boys who think they have everything You should run cross country with me And just like that My next 5 years were decided When I told them I didn t want to play guitar audition for the musical run track or march in the band My father literally put a hole in my forehead that didn t close for 2 months The bones in my skull have only been in the right spots for about 2 years now I spent most of 16 years alone in their basement Because I hurt their ego just by existing Therapists were the people who screwed me over worse than anyone else My parents forced me to go when I was 15 because I told them college was a waste of time and money I never had a chance to figure out my own interests talents or opportunities until I had one year of school left When my older sister offered me weed I took it I ll always regret that When anyone asks me Why It was just because I wanted to feel something other than hopeless At 16 I made enough from my job to pay for martial arts classes I almost broke a dude s arm for trying to steal my lunchbox My dad didn t touch me after doing that Because he wouldn t put hands on someone who could fight back I was 17 when I joined the National Guard The behavioral health girl got a bonus check for every soldier she diagnosed I was branded autistic and wasn t allowed to do the job they paid me to train for Because I didn t lie about my parents sending me to therapy I was a carpentry and masonry specialist in the Corps of Engineers I finally got to be proud of something I did on my own To build barracks for other soldiers and shelter for refugees But I never got to I passed the physical exam for flight school with flying colors But the feds have my autism diagnosis on file So I m not even allowed to apply I m not even allowed to learn a trade To pass or fail on my own I m stuck on the ground in one of the poorest counties in the country Not good enough to leave My golden boy brother is 27 and still in college He ll be in debt for the rest of his life My sister almost went to jail for worse drugs than weed And they bailed her out 4 or 5 times I m in no debt and have no record After all that I m still the lazy one For everything THEY DIDN T LET ME DO IN HIGH SCHOOL I m still living at my father s house My younger sister has been put through enough by that asshole As angry as I am about not being able to afford a house of my own I m happy I get to be there for my sister She still has 2 years of school left Having grown up in this house I feel responsible for her Because my parents have neglected her about as bad they did me My friendship with my younger sister and cousins has made me strong Not my parents bullshit I ve gotten to be a father to them more than asshole my dad and uncle And I wouldn t change that for the world Sorry for the wall It just feels good to be heard Or read in this case",24,,sibling

text body: this is not necessarily for me 23F but rather my younger sister 17F i ll refer to her as K Long story short when she was around the age of 10 she got really cold to my dad We didn t understand why She eventually told my sister 20F i ll refer to her as Y that my dad had told her K not to tell anyone about when they were playing around my sister Y then about 13 didn t know what to do so she went and told me i asked her K what happened K said they were playing around and he was tickling her and then he kissed her but later told her not to tell anyone and it freaked her out K said it was simply a peck and it only happened that once my dad has always been an affectionate person and a small peck was normal as a child but it had always been innocent affection obviously it didn t continue after we got older we all got together as a family and talked about this my dad said the reason he said to not say anything was because he noticed K s reaction was starting to become more of something stimulating to her so he stopped and didn t want to make it embarrassing to K he didn t think too much of what he said as time went by everything was back to normal K and my dad s relationship looked unaffected though the possibility of that happening was always at the back of my mind from that point on and it really affected me he never gave me a reason to think he did it on purpose before or after the incident it made more sense it was miscommunication as my K got older she started to be more secretive and never spoke to us about her thoughts friends or school eventually we got a call from her high school that she got expelled after being caught vaping in the classroom that was something unbelievable to us Y and i were always calm and responsible getting anything lower than a B was disappointing to us let alone expelled K was grounded and expelled for a week K brought up the incident again saying that what my dad did to her affected her we spoke about it again and it seemed like we reached the same conclusion as before he apologized and said he never meant for something like that to happen and make her feel like he was doing harm to her K returned back to school but it made us question who she truly was eventually through mutuals Y was told that K had a boyfriend we assumed K was embarrassed to tell us since Y and i never had a relationship before so we just kept quiet and waited until K felt comfortable enough to tell us as K s punishment for not doing well in school my mom took away her phone on there was conversations with her boyfriend an entire different person was in her phone and school in her gallery we found nudes both of K and her boyfriend that they would send each other there was conversation to her friends about them K and her bf skipping school and having sexual interactions in our family car she drove herself to school in it wasn t having a boyfriend that we were worried about but rather how she was going about it my parents were never strict with us in that aspect either Y and i never were in relationships as a personal choice however K being secretive about it sharing what is essentially child pornography skipping school to goes god knows were was what was wrong they thought it was best to pull K out of school and do it online her phone was taken away at first but eventually it was given back in short periods of time once again after looking through her phone we saw K was texting her boyfriend honestly didn t really mind much since it was expected however it was disappointing since we offered her to meet with him in a public setting as couples her age should be doing but she refused and just kept contacting him secretly again in those messages her boyfriend said that he was mad that she is dealing with your moms emotional decisions meaning that K s punishment was simply do to my mom being emotional essentially saying she K did no wrong in that same conversation K said she will try to do something about my parents allowing her to go back to school the last week before summer break later that day she was crying and when asked what was wrong she would say nothing K spent the entire next day in bed sleeping and crying eventually my mom got sick of her acting that way since it felt like it was a tantrum to let her go back to school and in that confrontation she brought back the incident with my dad saying it has affected her and that her friends and boyfriend are the only ones to make her happy she continued to say that she never opened up to my sister Y my mom and i was because we didn t believe her when my dad did that to her in that i told K we did that s why we spoke as a family and confronted him about it at first and it was settled as a misunderstanding then K goes on and says that he actually would put his knee between her legs and rock her back and forth he would also make out with her and that it wasn t only once but it went on for a month before she told us my heart dropped this was entirely different than what she had told us first and it would change the entire event i told this to my dad and as i was observing his reaction to see if it was true it looked like his eyes looked hurt rather than panic he maintained his story on it and said that he never did anything to her other than innocent playing K then went that s all i needed to hear and stormed off when i asked her what she meant by that K said he kept saying it was innocent when it wasn t that i was ten and he knew better and K wanted him to admit that he SAed her basically my dad said he wanted to go back and avoid that entire situation from ever happening and even told her that if she truly felt that he had hurt her to call the cops on him and he would gladly go he just didn t want to see her suffering anymore because of him when she denied doing so he even offered moving out but again declined we offered her a therapist and she hesitantly agreed this entirely changed our family forever the father i know and grew up with would rather die than hurt us he never once made me doubt his intentions toward us or anyone he had always been an anxious man that couldn t lie for his life because his anxious tics would give him away his heart has always been pure and loving my other sister agreed as well so him doing this to her was something my mind couldn t fathom i ve heard stories of families not being there for their children that were SAed and to protect the family essentially denied it happening i didn t want to do that to her my mom said that although she loves my father she will always love her children more my father said the same and understood if we wanted to believe K entirely i don t know what to think i don t deny this affecting my sister but at the same time i feel like i know her less than my dad had Y been the one to say this id have no doubt but K makes me question things why did her story change okay sure maybe she was scared or didn t realize to mention it yet why does she coincidentally bring this up when she s in trouble maybe her emotions are heightened and her emotions spill out why would she ever lie about something this serious is she willing to make this up for her benefit i m not so sure i don t know what to do or what to believe",23,Female,sister

1082,My sister has ruined my pregnancy by being vindictive & self righteous - warning: long story,"title: My sister has ruined my pregnancy by being vindictive & self righteous - warning: long story
author: Royal_Juice2987
text body: Warning very long story and I don t have the energy to summarise after writing it all out but any advice appreciated if you can be bothered reading Thanks I 34F am currently 35 weeks pregnant May 25 This is my first baby and I am pregnant with a baby girl My sister 31 has been my closest friend my entire life but we are completely different personalities As a child I was very outgoing and confident whereas as an adult I suffer with generalised anxiety and have had some low levels of depression on and off throughout my adult life I am an empath and think and feel quite deeply My sister was very shy as a child but has grown up to be a little more outgoing although I don t think she is as emotionally deep as me she has never experienced anxiety and almost dismisses mental health problems generally I d say she thinks that good mental health is a choice and can be controlled easily For reference we have a narcissistic mother a passive emotionally avoidant father and there has been lots of dysfunction in our family and triangulation from my mother in the past I think it s fair to say we have both picked up some horrendous communication habits from our parents We have never been taught good communication or healthy resolution Admittedly I am emotional and see red quite quickly often saying things that whilst are very real to me and 100 relate to what I am feeling and experiencing aren t always helpful My sister on the other hand avoids conflict but is also extremely snappy sulky stroppy and can be very vindictive If you cross her at all she storms off in a bad mood and can give you the silent treatment for as long as she feels fit and it seems she feels absolutely nothing My sister was pregnant a couple of years ago and I had to be at her beck and call every single day to listen to her pregnancy woes and I was always on the other end of the phone to cheer her up on a bad day This continued into my niece arriving I have been obsessed with her ever since feel deep deep love for her and have spent a lot of time with her since she was born Back in February sort of mid late second trimester my sister carefully broke it to me that she was looking to book a holiday around my due date I was gutted she is the only family I really have My mother is so toxic I can t bear her being near me She emotionally abused me for years and I can t stand the thought of her near me or my daughter and my dad never even said congratulations to me because he s too wrapped up in my mums commands This has been a theme throughout his entire relationship with her he s isolated from his own family he has no friends has even seen off his business partner and he acts like he doesn t even have a brain of his own anymore My sister was trying to sell going away to me as leaving me in my bubble This felt weird because her birth was very adverse emergency c section and a stay in hospital with her little girl to which I responded to her every whim to make sure she was cared for Running extra clothes and snacks to the hospital all the while not being allowed in to see her or the baby which was fine and running out to buy some preemie clothing for the baby when she came home as she was so small nothing fit My anxiety took me straight to a place where I would need a family member in a similar capacity and she wouldn t even be in the country I know you can t control people s lives but this stings because I would never book a trip within a month of her due date I care too much and this wouldn t even be a worry she would have to think about I left it a couple of days and felt stressed My partner told me to speak to her I approached it very gently but it quickly turned sour She s a SAHM and her husband pays for them both to live earns an extremely good salary and they are very very well off financially She played the card ask him because he s not willing to pay hundreds of pounds more to go away weeks after because it s school holidays and it gets expensive This pissed me off because 2 years ago she coughed up over 1000 just to go on a hen do for one of her friends his money their money and he wasn t even going I didn t say this to her but I feel like her husband digs his heels in when it s anything to do with her family because he only prioritises his own and they re always seemingly in competition with who s family gets more time with them and their child etc which I find very weird I did tell her that this was tight fisted and that I didn t feel a few hundred pounds warranted missing the birth of your first niece no other kids in the family apart from hers and to not be around for me post partum for a short while I say this knowing I 100 did this for her and if anything it felt like an honour Prior to these messages when she was trying to sell to me being in my bubble as in her not being here in my way she recited a conversation between her and her husband where they d been discussing my due date and how she couldn t possibly miss the birth and she said to her husband I know my sister she s not having a very nice pregnancy and she won t go overdue she will just go to the hospital and get induced I didn t say anything at the time but this really upset me because induction is the last thing I d ever want and I ve expressed this before but seemingly doesn t listen and just wanted to make sure my pregnancy fit in with her plans of a summer holiday abroad I m getting annoyed just reliving all of this right now to be honest Anyway moving on she snapped on the texts and said oh fuck off I won t be there at all at this rate which really hurt me She knows that s what I needed and she went from seemingly caring to switching completely when things weren t going her way I told her she was a poisonous cow and there were a few irrelevant lines exchanged after that then it stopped This was 3pm and I was waiting for a reply 8pm I noticed she blocked me on WhatsApp She s never done this before this is also the first argument we d had in 18 months I cried my eyes out to my husband night saying she didn t care and that there are a completely different set of rules and expectations for us as sisters I work from home and the next day I was so exhausted from crying all night and not sleeping that I rang in sick and I just slept on and off all day with my curtains drawn and felt so shit My husband who would never ever normally get involved called my sister to speak to her that morning He is honestly so polite and tries to be impartial at all times He told her I m not having a good time he was worried about me I didn t feel like I had any family etc and she seemed to get a bit upset herself He suggested we take a day or a few away from each other and without saying it directly suggested she reach out when we had cooled off 4 weeks passed still blocked Her husband invited my husband to do a marathon training run together they did and when her husband dropped mine off at home in the car he raised the row My husband said I was blocked and that sent a message in itself Another 2 weeks passed then she unblocked me seemingly waiting for me to make the first move I d be happy to do this but in my experience my sister is NEVER over an argument and if you approach her at any point afterwards it is just another opportunity to drag you over hot coals again She literally is so pissy and difficult to talk to without her forcing an apology out of you even if she had a huge part to play in the issue After she unblocked me another 6 weeks passed 3 months she s avoided me for during my pregnancy this is something she would 100 have disowned me for if I did to her I d never be allowed to forget it my life actually wouldn t be worth living This weekend just gone her husband had been pressing my husband all week to meet him for a drink They met at a pub for a few hours had a few drinks and he was basically saying that I needed to reach out and apologise for calling my sister poisonous and calling them tight fisted Basically insinuating I d be giving birth and not having them involved in my child s life if I didn t grovel My husband is super polite but he told me after a few drinks he lost his temper a bit and said there is absolutely no way I am going home to my pregnant wife who is about to give birth in a matter of weeks and telling her she needs to apologise for this mess and he basically said it s not going to get resolved then because my sister wasn t willing to reach out My husband also said he got the impression that my sister had fully considered the long term effects of this My husband also said that her husband said my sister was actually growing increasingly annoyed about me not reaching out because I hadn t seen my niece in 3 months May I repeat that my sister is the most unapproachable person when she s in a bad mood and this is the longest she s ever gone without talking to me and I already had the impression she was using my niece as bait to make me come running to her despite feeling like she has abandoned me first by booking a holiday when I m due and secondly by being absent for half of my pregnancy and certainly during the darkest time of it when I felt really low and poorly My husband came home we talked I cried and we said we needed to just accept they weren t going to be around at all when I gave birth and that they weren t too bothered about it therefore we should stop worrying about it Side note we have our suitcases stored in their loft until we have ours boarded out and I need one for my hospital bag genuinely been a concern for a while now So I said to my husband I m not willing to hang on a few weeks and then ask to collect them because it will drag everything up again and it will look like we re trying to start a conversation about it again So my husband asked her husband if he could collect them next week he said yes Then later in the evening he said what if I spoke to my sister and got her to call tonight and my husband asked me how I d feel I said I was fine with it He then replied again saying she s going to need some more convincing plus their daughter was poorly and they had their hands full that night plus my sister had a part time job application to fill before Friday so she was busy It s now early hours Saturday and she s not called If I know my sister she will be going through the last WhatsApp chat with a fine tooth comb to find anything she can trip me up on to blame this on me She keeps the receipts for absolutely everything I m nervous to talk to her because she will beat me with the stick I hand to her basically If I tell her I felt low and heartbroken when she cut me off she will use it against me If I act calm and nonchalant she will tell me I don t care and I ve just caused trouble and it hasn t even affected me She is extremely extremely sensitive to words and I know she s after an apology for the poisonous and tight fisted comments Whereas it wouldn t shock me if she then didn t apologise for any of the above Every argument is about winning and dishing out maximum punishment for anyone who dare cross her I should add that in the last message from her husband he said She s dropping a shit load of pride to reach out My husbands jaw dropped I know my husband has seen a different side to them both in this argument and we ve agreed that if we sort things out for the sake of our kids etc then we will be giving them a much wider berth My sister has always been beyond sensitive when it comes to any kind of feedback conflict confrontation but her husband who she s been with since she was 17 is the same and they make each other worse sitting at home plotting and validating each others reactions I feel so sick with myself for all of the stuff I ve done for her over the years I ve had crushing pain in my chest all night knowing that I could be having a conversation with her this weekend where I ll probably go to pot and won t get anything across in my defence This has ruined most of my pregnancy I ve thought about it every day since it happened and I ve not been able to escape it We live in the same small town and I ve been terrified of bumping into her in our local town centre for months She s really let me down I actually don t know if I can fully forgive her but also if I tell her things won t be the same and we need a healthier distance between us because we re so different then she will flip it and say well what s the point of talking about this if we re not going to go back to the way things were I can t do it to myself this one sided relationship anymore What would you do",34,Female,sister

text body: Hi everyone I wanted to share something personal because I know many people are dealing with toxic and abusive family situations and it can feel so isolating My dad has been a toxic manipulative abusive controlling and obsessive husband toward my mom for as long as I can remember He s never supported us financially everything came from my aunt and his parents My mom got pregnant at 17 and they married young Mom never finished high school but my dad did Growing up our home was full of trauma my parents fought constantly sometimes violently My dad was not only violent toward my mom but also physically and emotionally abusive toward me When I was a kid he told me he wished I was aborted Those words haunted me for years making me question my worth and pushing me into dark suicidal thoughts I remember my mom leaving us and hiding for months because my dad physically hurt her She even went to the police but my grandparents begged her not to press charges She was always alone Because of my dad s behavior mom lost contact with her own family for years my dad had a fight with them and he would break her phone anytime she tried to reach out Mom worked multiple jobs just to keep us afloat even when my dad s family sent money I saw so much pain growing up My parents were toxic to each other and immature and they kept going back and forth which made everything harder for me Now I m about to graduate college This week my parents finally decided to separate after my dad threatened to kill us We had to move out urgently I paid the rent this month from my savings just to get us to safety Even after the separation he stalked my mom at her workplace and harassed her coworkers to find our new address Thankfully they protected us by keeping quiet Mom didn t go to work today she started filing a VAWC case Violence Against Women and Children and I m hoping and praying for justice and peace for her After 24 years of marriage my mom finally decided to fight back I m so incredibly proud of her Despite everything the abuse the isolation the constant struggle she never gave up on us She worked tirelessly often juggling multiple jobs just to provide for me and keep me safe Her strength resilience and love inspire me every day To anyone out there who is trapped in a toxic or abusive situation You are not alone It s not your fault It s okay to ask for help It s okay to fight for your safety and your peace of mind We deserve love respect and safety Every day is a battle but healing starts with courage and taking one step forward Thank you for reading my story I m holding onto hope for me for my mom and for anyone who needs it",24,,child

text body: Some backstory My mom had me when she was 19 She always told me that she prayed that someone would love her unconditionally and when she got unexpectedly pregnant while she was nowhere near ready it was God sending me to her so she would have someone that would love her no matter what She was married to my brother s dad for a while and then they split up and since then we have lived in a number of different states and she has had a number of different boyfriends none staying super long My mom and I always had a rocky relationship as she refuses to get help for mental issues that make her borderline narcissistic but I always reminded myself that if I just got to 18 I could go to college and the distance would make it easier and better for both of us A few years ago my aunt who my mother had always been extremely close to died out of the blue at a fairly young age Ever since then my mom hasn t been the same She s constantly depressed she doesn t like doing the things she used to and she s developed this mentality that the universe is punishing her for something and everyone always leaves her All things that I understand come with grieving the issue is that she refuses to get help That brings us to August of this past year I decided to go to a college about 3 hours from home and I come back from school semi regularly about once every two months but sometimes more I have been dating my current boyfriend for a year and we are long distance since he goes to college 7 hours away from our home town I see my boyfriend and hang out with my friends at home a lot as this is the first time I ve had a real friend group because of all the moving throughout middle and high school My mom since I left for school has been constantly more depressed and begging me to come home I once asked her if she just thought I was going to live at home forever and she responded with a genuinely upset Yes Earlier this week she came into my room to say goodnight and was visibly upset I asked what was wrong and she started crying and said she felt like she died when my aunt did and that she just doesn t want to or feel motivated to do anything anymore all signs of textbook depression which I also have and am medicated for She then went on to say that she s upset that my boyfriend comes before her and one day I m going to have my own family as if it was a bad thing that I may have my own family one day I told her he does not come before her and she said he does She mentioned the other day when she had to make the hour drive to my grandmother s house at 6AM and was upset I didn t come knowing that my boyfriend had slept over the night before and we were out with friends until 1AM I said I was sorry and I felt bad but one day I will have my own family and I hope she d be happy and want that for me and of course I d still want to see her and have her be a part of my life I just want to help her stop feeling like this and I don t know how to It s weighing on me so heavily and everything I do without her makes me have this pit in my chest and intense guilt for wanting to have a life separate from her because her life has revolved around me since I was born I just don t know what to do",19,Female,daughter

hearing what they d say and being surrounded by toxic environments I was exposed to a lot as a child Sorry I ll continue After my sister moved in I was honestly very happy because she didn t have to be surrounded by an abusive household anymore She seemed better but I ll admit she might need to pick herself up and get a job There are some times her and our mom fight due to reasons in the past but I don t think it happens to much I go to school so I m not part of it at least I want to also add she has a big attitude and says a lot of things that have made me feel a little disturbed or sad Many times I d be called ungrateful or unappreciative but I dont know if I did anything wrong I feel horrible She constantly does this and the last time she said that I ve become more appreciative and more grateful was when I told her about a dream I had where she had drowned and I tried to save her I blamed myself and grieved over her death so badly I woke up with my chest aching She does say some other things but I m scared to go into details I want to also say I feel very depressed and unable to do many things in my life I ve gone through tough times and I don t want to put it into anyone My sister and other siblings know I was kind of forced to tell them what I could My sister said You know Me and you are kind of the same I don t know what to compare and contrast here Other than some instances we ve had that might be the same I don t know if I feel validated I make characters and add back stories to them I told her that some of my characters are inspired by people and are based off of what I learned or my experiences Their stories ending in good or bad endings or to in a way help me see from different perspectives or just to find comfort and create ambition for them so I can have my own ambition and continue a little longer I felt happy to tell her because she seemed interested in the stories my friends and I make but I never shared anything about the characters I told her and warned her it would be dark and in the middle of it she interrupted me and said how she feels uncomfortable that this character is based off of one of my friends and then made the story all about herself Then used my two of my friends who ve gone through abuse as an example What if he thinks this character is too similar to him that he feels bad and horrible and kills himself or if you never see him again I want to say that I take inspiration from my friends but I don t use their trauma in my character making I take inspiration off of how I see them either it s charismatic hardworking beautiful comforting loving I get it that from her perspective it s concerning but they were made because of my experiences and to represent parts of myself or who I needed to be there with me in my life I might ve responded really angst that I just wanted to finish my characters story she replied by saying if finishing your characters story is more important than what I ve told you about then I m honestly disappointed in you It feels like I don t have a voice when talking to her Just today it was raining really badly She usually picks me up and she parked far I had to walk through the rain and it was really cold I don t have the best body heat and I don t want to make it an excuse When I came into the car I just remember us starting small conversation I didn t respond with attitude but she says I did I just said You maybe could have parked closer And her response was At least you don t have to walk in the rain It just felt like an in and off battle I wasn t saying it to be mean or show disrespect I just wanted to have fun But then she got mad at me the second I started talking off my shoes and telling me how at least I didn t have to walk in the rain That I should be grateful for at least getting picked up and that atleast she was there The told me that I ve been having attitude I asked her that I wasn t show attitude yesterday or today and that but she spoke louder and said okay but even if you didn t you could still be doing it without realizing it and that I ve been having a problem with everything she has been doing that I should realize the way I ve been treating her She then brings up past incidents which made me feel so scared I joke around a lot and add emotion in my voice because my friends laugh and find it funny and since for a long time I ve been distant with my family I wanted to have that same amount of fun and replace those bad memories but she makes it out to be like I did something wrong I feel like I did After her rampage I cried in my room before leaving my glasses and running away from home into the rain with my phone Half way on my walk I called a friend and cried to her about my sister I was shaking and cold and vented to her about everything I dont know what I did wrong and I dont know what I need to do for her She calls me ungrateful and unappreciative all the time when I do something that makes it feel like I don t care for others when I care so much about everyone I can t get my point across without her saying something first and cutting me off When I know I didn t show attitude in my voice she makes it seem like I did A lot of my family does that I try to talk but I feel so little when she raises her voice at me She brings up past events that I feel horrible and feel like I did something wrong That I need to work on myself because she said and pointed something out My friend says it s maybe guilt tripping but I don t know I don t want to make her out to be a bad person when I know she s gone through so much I did continue with my rant bringing up some things and some other things she did that I felt horrible for What hurts me the most is when I show the slightest bit of emotion in my voice I get called unappreciative and ungrateful and that I lack consideration for others and always try to start a fight with everyone Maybe some other things but I m just scared During my time under the storm shelter bailing my eyes out I got many calls and text from family but none from my sister who stared this One of them told me to go home and ignore her but I didn t want to face her I know that you have to confront someone or face your fears but I couldn t face her when I feel so vulnerable My friend advised me to take it out on herself but Immediately declined and cried harder After a while I got a text from a family friend who lives in our house and told me to come home and that he ll have to lecture me I didn t want to go home but I didn t want to get police and cause trouble anymore so I went home When he talked to me it felt like they only acted more about my physical being and return rather than how I was mentally or emotionally I felt unable to express and do anything because they wouldn t understand no matter how hard I tried I felt like giving up because I couldn t take it and it was piling up on me After I got cleaned up I sat on the couch scrolling through tik tok trying to find ideas to draw or laughing stupidly at some videos to ease myself My sister came and sat next to me and apologized but it didn t feel like it was genuine It hurt and I don t understand why I don t fully remember because so cried shortly after she left but it was mostly about how she s sorry that what she said affected and hurt me but and stated some other things and about how I ve been treating her I don t know how I ve been treating her I m trying to think about it and I m scared if I m really an asshole in this situation I laid down in my bed crying before trying to find something or anything to distract myself and pull myself away from darker thoughts until suddenly I stumbled on a video talking about verbal abuse Suddenly the events of today and other times came crashing down on me and I started panicking I don t want to make my sister or anyone in my family out to be a bad guy I looked deeper into it and searched up the following is calling someone ungreatful and unapreciative when they didnt do anything name calling if you ran away from home and your family only cares about your saftey rather than your mental health what does that mean verbal abuse The results made me think and now ins acted because I don t want anyone in my family and for my sister to feel like a bad guy or the bad person but I want to tell them but most of the time they don t understand or they understand but they aren t empathizing and trying to attempt I feel like all the other times I ve shown to be in distress or have been hurt by my sisters words it is dismissed because it s how she acts or that she is a grown woman but she ll be herself and learn eventually or it s just how she is or something I think back to the times as a child I didn t understand why they talked bad about her sometimes and why they saw her as mean or bossy or have a lot of attitude But today I feel like I just realized she s been speaking very aggressively with me and that my family only cares more about me being present and not my mental state I don t know I just remeber watching a lot of Reddit stories and the OP s being comforted or helped I just want to know if I m doing something wrong or if I need to do better for her and everyone so they don t have to deal with me as much anymore I want to understand if there is anything I can do to try and fix this or try talk to someone But I m scared I m very sorry if anything is confusing or doesn t make sense I m really sorry",,,sibling

text body: I m 25 and finishing my master s in economics From the outside I seem like a successful person especially in education My father admires me a lot for that and deep inside I ve developed a kind of pride about it which I don t feel good about It makes me feel like I m better than some others which I know is not true My father is in many ways a strong person He took responsibility for his entire family at 18 pulled them out of poverty and now we re considered a wealthy family with a family business He s like a self made man a provider but also extremely controlling The family expects me to help with the business but the truth is I can t at least mentally Every time I try something inside me hurts The business is in bad shape and I think everyone hopes I will fix it just because I m educated but I feel stuck paralyzed I also feel like I can t breathe around my father Even when I try to make my own decisions I feel like his shadow is watching or judging me He tries to get closer to me these days I think he s going through hard times emotionally and health wise and he s trying to rely on family but I always pull away When he talks to me or tries to get intimate emotionally I feel fake I try to respond with warmth but deep down I feel like I m pretending I don t understand why I can t connect with him I m usually talkative and open with others but not with him What hurts the most is that we don t have a real relationship And I love him I m worried about him He s getting older and sick and I know he s trying to lean on me But I don t let him It feels like shame Has anyone else experienced something similar feeling blocked from connecting with a parent even when you care deeply How do you even begin to repair a relationship that feels emotionally distant and weighed down by control guilt and unspoken expectations",25,,son

author: depressedpebbles73
text body: I 18F am very close with my dad My dad s parents my grandparents were my role models growing up We would visit them several times a year My grandmother would bake cookies from scratch always oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip and she always seemed happiest when we were in her kitchen My grandfather would take us on his motorcycles and laugh as we watched History channel documentaries about Bigfoot and other silly stuff My grandma didn t just send birthday cards she made handmade cards for every single holiday even obscure ones you don t usually get cards for She d write sweet little notes inside just like you d expect from the perfect grandma I kept most of them in a box because they felt like little pieces of her I adored them I genuinely looked up to them and wanted to grow up to be like them kind thoughtful involved They were the people I bragged about having in my life I loved them so much and for most of my life I believed that love was simple safe and unquestioned But that changed When I was 11 years old my family and I flew to visit my mom s side of the family for Christmas When we got back to the airport in our home state we realized the battery had died So we called my uncle who lived nearby and he picked us up He dropped us off at my grandparents who agreed to let us stay until we got the car fixed It was an unexpected visit but they were hospitable nonetheless One night I woke up late in the guest room to hear yelling My dad got me up and told me to pack up that we were leaving I was confused but I did so anyway I carried my sleepy 6 year old sibling in my arms as I walked out the front door just in time to see my grandfather screaming at my dad calling him a b stard and stupid in front of me Hey kids Tell your stupid dad to get off my property was his exact wording I don t really remember how I felt at the time I was just confused probably We left My uncle came and drove us to a car rental place which my dad had tried to avoid doing We went home that night and that was that There was no explanation for this incident We just didn t visit them anymore We didn t talk about it When my great grandmother my paternal grandmother s mom passed away when I was 12 it hit me really hard because I loved her dearly I saw my grandparents at the funeral and avoided them because it felt weird Even though I had no idea what had happened that night there was this new air of tension that I couldn t shake I was too busy grieving my great grandmother who had just passed It was the first funeral I d ever gone to My grandfather attempted to make amends with my dad at it but nothing went anywhere I didn t understand until a year later when I was 13 and my dad sat me down and told me about his childhood He carefully explained that his parents had verbally and physically abused him his entire childhood They were cruel to both him and my uncle Name calling religious guilt ridicule and outright bullying were among the things they endured And it was bad My dad suffered from what I had noticed but had not realized were PTSD symptoms my entire life Even now in his 50s my father is sensitive to sudden noises When he had kids he made a conscious decision to try to rebuild some kind of relationship with his parents so that we could have grandparents in our lives But that night the tension that had been building for over a decade finally broke and the truth about who they really were came crashing down around us Honestly I was heartbroken and I still am It was a strange situation to process My dad was and still is my best friend My favorite person in the whole world He has really broken the cycle of abuse He s the best father I could ask for and nothing like his parents Finding out that he had been dealing with things I had no clue about was really confusing and frustrating I wasn t angry at him for not telling me sooner I understood how difficult that choice must have been From 13 to 14 I had other stuff going on so I didn t really deal with what I was feeling about that situation But the pain kept coming back when I least expected it A few months after I found out my dad and I were on a trip when his brother called to say their father was in the hospital and might be dying My dad drove us to the hospital and I stayed in the waiting room while he went to visit He let me decide if I wanted to go I said no I was angry I still am By 15 I started to really understand how much the grandparent thing hurt me When seeing an 18 wheeler with their small town s name on it made me start crying it was a clear sign something was wrong The people I loved and trusted most had betrayed me decades ago and I had no idea Every kind thing they did felt tainted I had been loving people who had abused the most important person in my life I can t imagine the pain my dad might ve felt hearing me say I wanted to be like them when I grew up My dad has genuinely made peace with it and healed in his own way and I am so proud of him He has reminded me that he is okay that he has processed the trauma of what happened to him He doesn t care about his relationship with them He knows what happened wasn t his fault But this whole thing has impacted me in a way I didn t expect I m still processing the pain of this betrayal It s a strange situation to find out what a family member did but what happened didn t directly happen to you I feel all this anger and betrayal and sadness I can t look at photos of me with them or think about their house without imagining my dad as a child crying scared and alone It taints all those memories and it hurts a lot It didn t even happen to me What sucks is I don t know anyone else who s been through this How do I move past this anger towards them I hate that they weren t actually kind people They were just as terrible as they were all those decades ago My dad is okay so why can t I be okay Having genuinely good grandparents was something I cherished and now every time I hear my friends or other people talk about their grandparents I feel the burn of envy I really wanted to have my grandparents at my graduation at my wedding etc I wanted to have them there because they were important to me They were in so many of my childhood memories The pain has faded a bit over the years but now at 18 I m still processing my anger and trying to forgive them I m reminded of this because I received the news the other day that my grandfather is very ill and likely going to pass away soon I feel nothing and I m not ashamed of feeling nothing about it I know damn well I m not attending that funeral I m grieving the loss of how I used to know my grandparents How they once were perceived by my child mind This is whole situation is what I ve been working through for the past 8 years And it s painful It really weighs on me and has been the source of so much anger and pain It s hard to put into words really I hate that I share blood with them I hate that I m always tied to them no matter what I know I m not like them and I never will be To put it plainly I m just sad I don t miss them I don t want to speak to them or see them ever again I ve been to therapy and journaled and written unsent letters to them and everything but it s still here It didn t even happen to me but it still hurts So here I am sharing this because I don t really know how to process it all on my own I just want to hear people s thoughts or stories Sometimes it helps just to know you re not alone Thanks for reading It really means a lot",18,Female,daughter

text body: I 29f am the second of four girls We re all very close including our mom all are no contact with our father My parents younger sisters and I moved to a different state when I was a teenager and my older sister stayed because of her then boyfriend A couple years later she ends up needing out because he s become abusive My husband then boyfriend and I moved her in get her a car and a job and let her live there for free while she gets on her feet Six months later she ends up moving back to where we re from with one of her exs bestfriends and they end up together Fast forward 5 years and she moves in with my mom and younger sisters because he s also a druggie and becomes extremely abusive This time she moves in with her kids 5 7 now 3 5 at the time She lived with my mother for free for almost a year before she got a job She only applied for two jobs that first year The first one was where I worked at the time wfh and flex scheduling and the second was where she ended up working cleaning cabins She refused to put her youngest in daycare while her oldest was in school because she didn t want strangers watching them Which I get but you can t be a single SAHM with no job I suggested since she didn t get hired where I worked to look for other WFH jobs and she just never looked literally admits she never made a resume or looked When she moved here the kids were loud not normal loud angry screaming loud from living in an abusive house had no boundaries and were super emotional It s super clear to all of us they have PTSD The oldest told me the day she moved down here they moved because daddy hit mommy hard in the eye Well here we are two years later and she still has yet to do anything to help her kids Their behavior has gotten so much worse Her parenting style is letting them do what they want and if she needs them to do something she screams and they scream back She never follows through and the only time they ever actually end up listening is just if they have less willpower than her at the time She has told em before she just caves all the time because she would prefer to give them what they want instead of listen to them whine and cry We ve all told her the kids severely need therapy They re book smart but socially and emotionally super delayed and we re pretty sure it s because they have CPTSD She is around other children too and has admitted her kids have tantrums that are on par with a 2 3 year old instead of 5 7 year old So she knows it s not normal behavior yet she still isn t doing anything to help them either at home or getting them in therapy She also doesn t take the time to teach them anything because it s easier to do it herself so her youngest is five and still unable to dress herself brush her teeth wash herself and other things most kids can at least do with supervision or little help It s to the point our mother other sisters and I all feel like it s neglectful The thing is their behavior is starting to have an impact on the rest of the family No one wants to be around her and her kids because every time they re around it turns into a screaming match between her and her kids that s so loud you can t have a conversation in the same house as them Her kids do have meltdowns and such other toddler like behavior when my sister isn t around but it s not as bad without her because they don t scream at everyone and we usually try and help them process their emotions instead of screaming at them for having them Here s where I m asking for help how do you navigate this kind of relationship When she s around with her kids she makes absolutely all of us miserable We always hung out as a family once or twice a week and it s down to about once a month now because no one wants to get together and listen to their screaming match To add to this she also has picked up a lot of toxic traits from being in abusive relationships for over a decade She is very manipulative and judgmental She is the oldest and regularly makes remarks about my sisters partners who are amazing to them simply because she s jealous that they re so young and are married and engaged She makes comments all the time that I don t let my kid watch tv at home and that cloth diapering is a waste of time She makes comments about me being spoiled simply because of my husband treating me well and sharing in his part of taking care of the house kids and cooking She complains about my youngest sister not holding a job because of her BPD even though she still only works part time after two years since she got out of her relationship She now lives with her new boyfriend and before they moved in with Him she would regularly leave her kids at home with my mom and sisters while she went to his house without even letting them know she was gone She regularly takes advantage of us when she gets a chance she ll ask for us to babysit so they can go on a date night motorcycle ride get a new tattoo or whatever but she won t ask us for help watching her kids so she can get a regular job I understand she s still probably processing years of trauma but it s really hard to want to maintain a relationship with someone who makes you miserable and takes advantage of you when they re not making any effort to better their life and neglecting their children s mental and emotional wellbeing",29,Female,sister

text body: I ll start by saying that this is both a post to vent a torrent of emotions I ve held back for years but also something I could use any advice for I 25F am the only child of my folks who are in their early 60s We have faced many tumultuous times since the mid 2000s when my parents lost their business and developed debt issues as a result the magnitude of which was largely unknown for a couple of years as my father handled the finances Prior to this my father struggled with addiction issues as well Many of my nights from 7 years old onward involved trying to keep the peace between my mother and father As my therapist recently revealed to me it was apparent from a young age that my folks co regulated their emotions with me more so than I did with them I definitely think there s some kind of trauma bond with my mother too because of all of this The lack of money the increasing debts the addiction issues and health scares have created a perfect storm of regular fights and general unhappiness for both my mother and father I have tried to set boundaries with them about placing me in the middle of their arguments a couple of years ago and for the most part that held until the last couple of months I receive paragraphs from my likely intoxicated father detailing how upset he is To my mother s credit she does not inform me of these disagreements It has also been said to me by both of my folks that I am the main source of their happiness In many other ways they have been wonderful parents Fully supportive of all of my endeavors telling me they love me making my favorite foods when I visit spending normal quality time together The highs are high with them but lows are low At this point I have moved away to be with my long term partner The distance has given me a lot of clarity but with it comes some hard truths I don t know how to face Their issues from financial to interpersonal are draining me emotionally to the point that I am so depressed over the situation I can barely get out of bed I am crying every day over things that frankly I shouldn t even be involved in Being an only child amplifies the strain I feel have no one to turn to for help No other family no siblings It feels like I am completely alone in this but also that this is a cage of my own design for involving myself at such a young age with my help which has become commonplace for nearly the last two decades I am so angry so sad so depressed so anxious I am doing my best to work things on my own and hold boundaries firm without having regrets related to my folks and the love I have for them It feels paradoxical and I am so lost Thanks for reading this far If you ve experienced this if you have any thoughts or advice I d be so grateful TLDR I have had a tumultuous relationship largely with my father but have come to recognize hard truths about my parents who both intentionally and inadvertently involve me in their problems despite me being a grown adult who lives far away I am drowning with a combination of guilt anxiety and stress as their only child Any thoughts or advice appreciated",25,Female,only child

text body: I ve had quite the relationship with my mother Back in October 2023 I went through a really dark time in my life and I opened up to her about it instead of being a mother she played victim and got angry at me for hurting her yet it was ME in pain and nothing that had happened during that time had anything to do with her I literally just needed my mom I then saw a psychologist and it was decided that my mom was not good for me that I would not be in a safe place around her and it was best to avoid her I cancelled my Christmas plans and decided to stay home Leading up to December my step father started calling and begging me to visit He ended up passing away a week before Christmas cancer none of us knew He was the main provider in the household and my mother had nowhere to go So I sucked it up and had her move across the country to live with me It s been pretty rough but it s better than kicking her out on the street She lost her own mother a few months after her husband She has no friends Nobody to talk to Nowhere to go I can see she s struggling and she s in so much pain but I simply don t give a damn I struggle to look her in the eye and show any interest in her And it s literally just dawned on me that I m probably a horrible person I understand all the pain and loneliness she s experiencing and she truely does need me but I think that s her problem and she needs to get over it by herself just like I had to when I needed HER Anyway I probably could have shortened this message but has anybody gone through this Is there any advice on how to be a better person I tried Googling but I couldn t find anything",,,daughter

text body: So I have no idea where to post this and as far as I know none of my family had a Reddit so So a few years ago I did an ancestry dna test I didn t really pay attention to everything at first until recently and it has DNA matches that show maternal and paternal side Then it also shows your ethnicities by parent The ones on the paternal side were not adding up So I went and talked to my brother he is 8 years older than me Back in 1999 my parents had separated and my mom met this guy online She said he was an old friend but it was probably just so my brother didn t tell anyone something else Anyways my mom and brother went and visited this guy down to Mississippi where he lived They stayed for a week and then they came back I have no idea how things ended When she was 10 11 weeks pregnant with me she filed for divorce from her husband but then they never got a divorce Anyways my brother was trying to tell me all he remembered and he remembered the guys first name I got in touch with someone who literally finds bio family through ancestry He found my potential father and the pieces of the puzzle are making sense My brother is taking an ancestry dna test as well just to see what pops up for him and if it ll put us as half siblings The guy that found him gave me his Facebook and the contact info he could find for him I have no idea where to go My mom has never even brought him up Just a long time ago she said her and my brother flew to Mississippi and that was it There s so many possible outcomes Once my brother gets the dna results I am going to wait a bit to talk to my mom as my husband and I are about to have our 4th baby in a few weeks and moving into a new house I m already stressed about everything and we know my mom is going to completely flip out I do not have a relationship with the guy who raised me anymore Lots of stuff happened a long time ago My mom has been remarried to my step dad for almost 6 years I love my step dad He is great But my mom flips out over stuff especially if it s something she knows she did wrong but always plays the victim Now I love my mom and she is a great grandma and I don t want anything to affect her relationship with my kids However I feel like I deserve to know the truth about myself I ve talked to my husband about starting therapy to process my emotions about this whole thing and figure out the best next steps so when I talk to her maybe we can keep it peaceful and civilized I feel like this is something she would ve taken to her grave honestly I haven t had anything to do with the guy who raised me in 5 years and during this time she has never said anything I do plan on contacting the guys after I talk to her We don t know the whole story so this guy could ve not wanted me but he was great to my brother and has two sons himself His younger son has a little girl and he seems like a good grandpa and doesn t seem like he would be a deadbeat So I m not sure I don t know I feel bad for my brother because he has carried this since he was 7 years old And per my brother there had been things said in the family about me not being the daughter of the guy who raised me Another thing is both my parents have blue eyes my brother has blue eyes I have brown eyes Guess who else has brown eyes Potential father This is a stressful situation because there s so many outcomes for this situation like my mom s reaction how this guy is going to react what if we decide to have a relationship and how that affects my kids because the only grandpa they know on my side is my step dad We haven t told them any different I don t know I m just stressed and upset that my mom even put me in this situation",25,,daughter

text body: For context I m 19 years old and I ve been dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil especially regarding my twin brother We used to be close but over time our relationship has become strained and now I feel like I m constantly walking on eggshells around him I ve been isolating myself for the last two years focusing on my studies to get into elite schools and make my parents proud But in doing so I ve lost the chance to have close friends except for my sister I don t have anyone to be open with about everything that s been going on I ve always tried to respect the unspoken rules between my brother and me especially when it came to relationships and girls There was this girl my brother was talking to and even though I could tell there was some kind of interest on his part I made sure to keep my distance I didn t want to interfere so I subtly made it clear I wasn t interested in her I thought that was the right thing to do just to help him out and avoid making things weird On my side there was this girl from my school We d talk as classmates in a group with the guys nothing serious just casual conversation She was cool and everything seemed fine between us But then things started to change My brother began talking to her and at first I didn t think much of it I didn t have strong feelings for her she was just a cool friend that I appreciated having and I just wanted to be a good friend you know However things got strange when I noticed how she started engaging with him A few days ago I found out she had sent him a message It wasn t just a casual hello She called him by his name something she had once done with me but I responded late so she didn t reply But he went further sending her long messages asking about her interests and things like that Not to mention he hides his contacts from me and excludes me when he talks about girls he s interested in with the boys And the fact that he already has a girlfriend that he still hides from me is confusing He once hinted at it saying I think you know her you showed her to me once So yeah when he got that message from my friend we were with some family members and he mentioned it in front of me saying Oh there s a girl who sent me a message by my name They were all cheering him on in front of me and I felt completely invisible I couldn t help but feel hurt When I looked at his phone I saw that she had a profile picture on WhatsApp that I hadn t seen on mine She added him even though she didn t know him well but didn t add me There was a time when we were talking with that girl and she took my phone to add herself and send me a personality test Out of curiosity I waited until my brother was asleep to see how things were going between them They were still chatting and I saw her calling him honey and hun Feeling bamboozled and betrayed by both of the closest people I know I decided to block her and ghost her in real life because I felt disrespected I haven t spoken to my brother since A day later he came to me like nothing had happened When I hinted that I didn t want to talk to him anymore he said Why aren t you talking to me Are you acting snobby or something Knowing he has narcissistic traits I just said No I don t know if he knows he messed up but he never apologized or confronted me about it and I didn t either because every time I confront him he just twists my words and I end up getting angry and fighting him I tried talking to my sister about it but she got irritated and told me You re insecure You should have told him you had feelings for that girl whom I now call a bitch But I thought we had unspoken rules Then she started crying knowing she has her own problems and I made her day worse I ended up breaking my phone out of anger and locked myself in my room I can t talk to my sister anymore after what happened and I don t feel like I can talk to my parents especially with our cultural background where things like this are considered a bit taboo in our religious family I m overwhelmed What did I do wrong And was it the right decision to ghost that girl and not talk to my brother again",19,,sibling

text body: I ve been with my fiancé for a decade now and have never felt particularly close to his family He has brothers who want to be very actively involved in his life despite not connecting with them on the same sorts of things One has a wife and kids the other is ten years younger and single so that kind of paints the background They seem to have a tribe mentality and don t like anyone new joining the mix or the family The brother s wife is very territorial and is the self proclaimed matriarch of the family too so if you re not on her side you might as well not be part of this whole thing Prior to us getting engaged the brothers made off handed comments about me saying things like well I just don t see getting to know her if you guys aren t going to get married or if this is just another one of your long term relationships that end And they ve also alluded to me being a gold digger in a way despite my fiancé not making much money when we first got together and me giving no thought to his money or trying to take it It s the type of family where the status quo remains and they don t really bother with me when I m around don t care to get to know me etc I just feel like a wallflower during family events and have to show up to support my fiancé knowing full well the things they ve said about me in the past My fiancé has talked to them and come to my defenses so I don t think that that s the problem I guess I just don t know how to proceed with a family that doesn t seem to like me and that I don t like either They want a relationship with my fiancé of course but I notice that he s different when he s around them tends to complain more be negative only talk about the past and the good ol days etc they just don t seem to be going anywhere with their life just focused on their own family which is fine but that s not what me and my fiancé are about We re pulling away because we have different interests but it seems as though the brothers are clinging to what the relationship between them should be like Help",,,fiancée

text body: My partner and I have been together for almost five years We got together in 2020 but things really began a couple of years before that when we became friends through a Volunteering group VG Back then Harvey was openly gay but I wasn t not even to friends and family As far as my mum was concerned I was just a straight teenager without a girlfriend Harvey and I became close quickly and our relationship deepened from there We saw each other every Monday evenings through VG then started messaging daily playing Xbox and meeting up more often It wasn t long before our connection became more intimate and we became a couple on August 15th 2020 Months passed and eventually I knew I needed to tell my family I told a few close friends at first and then I told my mum one day as I was heading to work Harvey and I were now openly together and genuinely happy My mum always claimed that as long as I was happy she was happy but that didn t match how things felt At first she tolerated Harvey visiting and staying over but the atmosphere was often tense There was no outright hostility but also no warmth never a truly welcoming environment for him My half brother too reinforced her early doubts and beliefs They dismissed my relationship as just a phase a product of lockdown boredom something I d grow out of Despite my repeated efforts to explain that it wasn t a phase that I was serious about Harvey and happy they didn t listen To understand my mum you have to know her background she s unpredictable uneducated and had a difficult childhood foster care skipping school and losing her own mum young Still none of it excused the truly shocking comments and actions she made over the years I remember one moment We were all standing in the hallway at home Harvey came close and casually put his arm around me My mum looked at us visibly shocked and disgusted then she abruptly walked away It wasn t until weeks later that she brought it up to Harvey She said I could have just punched you for that Now I knew she d never lay a hand on him but he didn t No one would especially when you don t really know her Behind closed doors she would question me Are you sure you don t want to try being with a woman she d ask I always gave the same answer I knew who I was and what I wanted Each time she d repeat her line As long as you re happy Another time while Harvey was staying over again at mine I left for work and I d return in the afternoon My mum offered to take Harvey out for a walk with the dog During the drive she told him he should leave me That I was just bored That I wasn t really gay Harvey later told me he felt trapped in that car unable to speak unable to escape There have been good moments with my mum times we all laughed when she seemed to try but it was always hard to forget the deeper damage Even small nasty remarks that would re open bigger more hurtful wounds you were also never sure when the good times would abruptly end She d often say That s just how I am I say the wrong things sometimes you just have to get used to it Over time I repeatedly confronted her about her behaviour Especially the things she d say about Harvey s family She repeatedly called them snobs claimed Harvey s dad was having an affair which wasn t true and belittled the way they lived their lives It wasn t just about Harvey it was about the way she viewed anything different from her world She knew nothing about Harvey s family she d never even met them but that didn t stop her from making cruel comments When I pushed back and told her how inappropriate and untrue they were she d snap Am I not allowed to say anything without you coming at me Or it s just a joke On my 21st birthday she planned a family meal at a Hotel Harvey and I had been together for four years We arrived at her house ready to leave together However it turned out to be a surprise party at her home The night was surprisingly going well family friends and laughter I was shocked how well the night was going without incident Then I noticed her calling Harvey over I watched them talk and I felt uneasy When he came back he told me what she d said that he was controlling and jealous and that I was missing out finally saying that a friend that was at my party wasn t gay as if that mattered These weren t one off remarks She frequently asked if Harvey and I argued Did you argue she d ask after a weekend away or a normal day Most couples do argue occasionally but her obsession with it felt invasive even hopeful In her eyes I d lost my mojo and I wasn t the same funny person anymore all because of Harvey After the party we invited her over for a serious conversation She blamed the alcohol Morgan Spiced Rum and vodka but we reminded her that these kinds of comments had also come when she was sober She eventually admitted she was wrong and apologised She also admitted she was in a way jealous We made progress that day and I told her clearly if the remarks didn t stop I d walk away For a while things improved Harvey continued to make effort He messaged her visited her house included her But slowly the comments crept back in She d say things like Hello stranger making it seem like Harvey was the one not reaching out even though it was always him who made the effort When we visited she d focus all her attention on me ignoring Harvey entirely It became exhausting Eventually Harvey stopped messaging She didn t reach out either and the silence between them grew I still saw her on occasion but from November to January maybe even longer They didn t see or speak to each other During this time Harvey left his job and we were 100 fine financially We chose not to tell her knowing she d make it into a bigger deal than it was We explained it was handled but she saw through it watching for signs checking if Harvey s car was home asking indirectly is Harvey working today We told her the truth we didn t tell her because we didn t want to hear the endless worry speculation and judgment Of course she responded with Am I not allowed to worry But it wasn t worry it was criticism wrapped in concern Over the years Harvey became numb to her comments He tolerated them Occasionally they d have a good conversation but you never knew how long it would last One day they bumped into each other at the park and spoke for over an hour They talked about Harvey s past relationships and his mental health At the end of the conversation she said to him Since you re medicated now you won t be ungrateful and try and kill yourself again He told me later and I wasn t shocked just deeply hurt He asked me not to confront her I didn t But that moment stuck with me Eventually I started to mirror her own behaviour nasty remarks sarcasm just to show her how it felt When I made a joke in return she went into a huff and later sent a message accusing me of enjoying making her feel stupid She blamed Harvey too saying he encouraged me by laughing like a schoolboy That message crossed a line I replied and reminded her she d been making cruel remarks for years and I was done pretending they didn t affect me She told me the past was in the past That she couldn t trust Harvey because he twisted things and tried to turn me against her But nothing was twisted Harvey never exaggerated If anything he tolerated too much I called her angry and disappointed She denied everything Then hung up before I could finish I called back six times She didn t answer So I wrote to her a handwritten letter explaining that I no longer wanted contact This isn t about one argument I wrote It s about years of pain I wish things could have been different but they haven t changed For my own well being and my relationship I need to step away Since then we haven t spoken What I find most interesting in all of this is that my mum genuinely believes Harvey made up the comment she said to him that he won t be ungrateful anymore and try to kill himself again But Harvey would never lie about something so serious especially not that It s not in his nature and it s not who he is And even more telling if his goal had ever been to make me stop speaking to her why did he endure so much for so long Why did he sit through those awkward visits the uncomfortable silences the cruel remarks and the passive aggressive jabs If he truly wanted us to fall out he wouldn t have needed to fabricate anything He could have just pointed to all the real things she said and actions that occurred long before now But he never did He never once asked me to cut contact Even though deep down I imagine he wished I would Since then I ve cut contact with her entirely Still despite everything I genuinely wish her well I believe she will always carry a deep resentment toward Harvey and a lingering disappointment in me but I stand by my decision It wasn t easy but it was necessary All of this tells me everything I need to know about who he is and who she chooses to be I want to get more opinions about this Any responses will be appreciated First time I ve ever second guessed myself",21,Male,Son

text body: Hey guys I W18 have never written on here before but I am really frustrated right now Today is mother s day I am in my last year of school and currently have my final exams This week I had two big exams on Monday and Thursday so I haven t really been able to think about anything else Nevertheless as soon as I returned home from my exam on Thursday I purchased a gift for my mother W43 a perfume that I know she likes Unfortunately it didn t arrive in time When I woke up this morning I immediately wished her a great Mother s Day hugged her etc and told her that unfortunately my gift didn t arrive in time I had also reminded my younger brothers last week that it s Mother s Day soon so that they would get her something but unfortunately they didn t Other than that I also have an older brother who doesn t live with us because he s at College He and my mom had a fight last week and haven t talked since So when I woke up this morning she was already annoyed and in a bad mood because she also turned sick yesterday Throughout the day she freaked out and said really hurtful things She also told me to return the gift because it s unnecessary When I asked her why she told me that my dad already saw that no one got her anything and that he enjoyed seeing that no one appreciated her They have a really complicated relationship and my mom has been through a lot On one hand I feel really bad for not making her feel special and I understand that but on the other hand I think that she unnecessarily mean and shouldn t let her anger out on all of us I can t deny that she might have some psychological issues as she s really been through a lot but I don t think this legitimates her behaviour What do you all think What can I do to deal with her behaviour",18,Female,

text body: My husband and I have been planning for him to take the kids to visit his mom 45minute drive away for a few weeks now and it just hasn t worked out until this weekend I have a strained relationship with his mom So I prefer not to go It also gives me time to clean without the house getting messy again before I can finish This is a separate ongoing issue Anyway I was 100 fine with this plan until yesterday afternoon I mentioned that I was feeling a little down about mother s day coming up My husband said he totally understands My mom is out of state about 12 hour drive And I really don t have any IRL support My side of the family is supportive but not local I have emotionally supportive friends online and also not local I have a difficult relationship with most of my husband s family and they are more local So I guess it just kind of hit me yesterday that I m going to spend mother s day by myself cleaning Again it was mostly my idea that my husband take the kids to see his mom for a day so I can get things done by myself So I don t want to show my husband in a bad light Also we don t usually do much for mother s day or father s day His birthday is near father s day weekend so that is just a bigger deal to us My kids are looking forward to seeing their grandma I don t want to mess that up for them How can I bring this up If at all",41,Female,

author: sunnylikestostudy
text body: I m not really sure what I expect to come from this post honestly probably nothing This is my first Reddit post and I don t even know if I m posting it to the right place I just feel so overwhelmed and unheard and I guess I m just looking for a space where someone might understand and tell me its not all in my head and I m not a big crybaby for feeling like this and guide me on how to make this treatment stop I 16F have a younger sister 13F and it feels like she can t go a single day without bullying me I ve tried convincing myself that it s just normal sibling bickering and maybe we ll bond when we re older but that hope gets dimmer every day The truth is I hate how much I resent her I feel so guilty for feeling that way but the more I interact with her the stronger the hatred gets Looking back this probably started when we were little Our parents version of discipline involved me taking the brunt of the punishments usually yelling and beatings while my sister was apparently learning from watching me suffer Same mistake different consequences kinda thing For her just seeing me get beaten and cry was apparently enough of a lesson But instead of taking it as a warning I think she just grew up believing I was the mistake She learned to use that to her advantage When our parents were at work she d say things like If you don t do ___ for me I ll tell Dad you did ___ And as a kid terrified of my father I d always give in She held small things against me like sneaking extra candy for months I d get punished for stuff she made me do When I finally told my dad about it he just laughed He told her That s not a good thing to do and that was it No accountability No protection Just me still the punching bag Now the blackmail has lessened but the emotional jabs haven t They re constant Little degrading comments that chip away at my self esteem I m incredibly involved in school and extracurriculars I m in the IB program French immersion I wrestle for both my school and a local team I volunteer and I advocate for youth mental health especially eating disorders I leave home at 6 45 am and usually don t get back until 9 30 10 pm Meanwhile my sister doesn t even wake up until I ve left the house and gets home by 4 30 at the latest Even with all that free time she refuses to do chores mainly the dishes Then she complains I don t help enough and somehow convinces my dad I m lazy and living off him She constantly ropes my parents into things If I leave drops of water on the bathroom counter she yells for me to wipe it which my mom ends up hearing and I get yelled at If I meal prep with the last of an ingredient she wanted she ll call me fat even though I m not but I was chubby as a kid and she knows it s a sensitive spot She mocks my intelligence She insults me for no reason And when I finally snap and say shut up I get yelled at not her What hurts the most is how cold she is I say I love you to her almost every day usually in passing like bye love you She hasn t said it back since she was too young to know what it meant But she has no issue telling me she hates me that she wishes I were dead or that she wishes I weren t her sister I feel like she s breaking me My self confidence is at an all time low I overthink every interaction I don t start conversations unless someone clearly shows they want to talk to me because of how many times I ve been shut down by her when I talked about something I care about If I speak passionately about something I told to yap on and on she ll say things like Does your mouth ever get tired of talking Everyone laughs I fake a laugh too But inside I just feel smaller and smaller I don t like talking to her I avoid asking her for anything If I ask for a glass of water when she s right next to the sink she ll call me lazy and walk away so she can say she s too far and since I m closer I should do it myself If I ask her to come back and close the door after she leaves my room she pretends she can t hear me I know some of this sounds like typical sibling stuff but it doesn t feel typical when it s every day and when it s so mean She won t even send me pictures of myself when we go on trips I ve had to sneak them from her phone when she s asleep One time she left her phone unlocked on the table so I sent myself a photo I d been begging her to share for I think over a day at that point She got mad and reached for her phone and when I playfully held it out of her reach she pulled on my hijab In public Exposing my hair I reacted I pushed her away and slapped her arm My dad saw that and charged at me He had that look in his eyes the one that always means he s going to hit me It looks so hateful and I m always brought to tears because how can you look at your own child like that My aunt stepped in and stopped him but by then I was already crying and just walked away He later said he was only that angry because I m a wrestler and should be mindful of my strength But I always have to be mindful I always have to hold back She never gets told off for starting things insulting me or getting physical I always get in trouble for defending myself I just feel hated By her By my parents sometimes They ve done nothing real to stop her behavior And I feel like such a pushover for letting it keep happening It s affected how I act with everyone I barely speak up even with close friends People think I m mad or cold but I m just afraid of beingtld to stop talking or annoying people I know I sound sensitive But that s because I am sensitive And when I ask her to stop she tells me I m too soft or too emotional and that I need to toughen up to which I just walk away because crying or lashing out in front of her really does nothing but encourage her I feel like I m overthinking this again and just hurting myself but I m literally just so tired of feeling like a bad person or stupid or fat or ugly all at the hands of my sister Am I really just overthinking everything and need to wait it out before it gets better I m starting to feel like I don t want her at my milestones like my high school grad or even my wedding because she doesn t bring the love and happiness I want to feel on those days Do I need to have ANOTHER sit down with my family and tell them how I feel even though I know nothing will come of it Do I just wait and move far away for university and cut most contact with her",16,Female,sister

text body: I don t know where I should be posting this so here goes My family hasn t always been the best but I do love them still We recently went through a hard period but in recovery now My sister 19F hasn t been talking to me much since For context she and I are very close Very very close So I don t understand this sudden change To add on I had nothing to do with causing that particular hard time and I ve been wracking my brain trying to think why she is suddenly like that More things to add on I thought maybe she needed time to recover but she s been active and social with my other family members and her friends but not me I don t understand I ve tried to connect with her But her responses are so dry and she doesn t even seem interested in hanging out with me anymore In the past she always hung out with me It makes me really sad because we are really close and I miss our bond It hurts to hear her laugh and giggle in her room talking to her friends but become so stone faced for me Does anyone know why she might be acting like this",,,sibling

text body: I m really exhausted and to vent to people who don t know me or my family I m a mom to two kids with ASD level 3 and level 1 My husband works full time and is present active with our kids when he s home We live in a multigenerational home and pay rent for the floor we reside on mostly for the help support we need with the kids My brother also lives rents in the basement floor Monday Thursday I m up at 6am to get the kids breakfast and ready for school I get my oldest on the bus to school then drive my youngest to ABA Then for 3 hours I clean run errands and make lunch for the kids Then pick up my youngest from ABA go to my oldest school to pick him up we drive all the way back to the ABA so my oldest can have his sessions and then rush to get my younger to his preschool Once he s dropped off for 3 hours I finish running errands cleaning and prepping snacks and dinner If my husband doesn t get forced into mandatory overtime he ll be home early enough so the both of us can go pick up our oldest for ABA then once we re home with wait for my youngest bus to drop him home If my husband does have overtime he s not home till 630p and he does step in and do everything he can to help with the kids and their routine Friday Sunday I work from 3am 12p on Friday s the kids don t have ABA or preschool my mom helps me a lot She ll get my oldest on the bus to school and watch my youngest till I m home She ll also watch the kids on the rare date night or extra shifts My husband s usually off Saturday and Sunday and will do the bulk of the childcare but my mom will watch the kids till I m home if he has to do overtime My parents are the only support we have in this state so I don t mind helping them anytime they ask I take my mom weekly to Costco and any shopping she needs wants any tech support help they need I help with trips they need planning password resets bills customer service calls applications household chores pretty much whenever they ask for help I help My younger brother and I used to be close our relationship strained fractured when his weed use got so intense he was constantly screaming at me and my mom Our relationship really broke apart last year after he crashed his truck a second time we told him that he needed to cut is marijuana usage down no working driving while high no screaming at us He never cared at how much inconvenience we had to do for him my dad let him use his truck and took my moms car and I was responsible for getting her to and from work while still juggling my responsibilities He was paranoid that we were doing things to make him mad he thought we kicked him off the wifi when it was him that removed himself when he was trying to set some VPN on his phone my husband fixed it for him even though he was so aggressive and awful to me He took every loud sound the kids made as a personal attack on him that we were trying to ruin his sleep purposely making noise we do the best we can to limit noise and correct the behavior but they re still special needs kids that have no impulse control with stomping and kick We can t talk about anything around him without him either trying to condescend us or starts to get aggressive His aggression and verbal abuse got to the point my husband stepped in months ago and told him he needed to stop or get out but screaming at me and my mom was not accepted My dad even ended up with a screaming match with him because he kept cussing at my mom Around earlier this month my husband and I apologized to him for telling him leave due to how how often he was screaming the backyard and everywhere about how dare we try to kick him out his own home and my parents requested we apologize to see if that would bring some peace It did for a bit but instead of obsessing over that he started searching for new reasons to scream and yell My brother isn t responsible he was fired from his job for his aggressive behavior and drug use he was driving while high and operating machinery while high He won t take care of his space or any shared spaces constantly leaves him clothes in the washer and it was me that used to move his laundry or fully do his laundry at my mom s My brother leaves his floor so dirty that my mom has to go and clean his floor throw out garbage because he won t do it do his dishes because he ll leave it till it molds puts his clothes away bc he won t clean his bathroom because he won t even clean his crap stained toilet He still will pick fights and scream at her but my mom protects enables him when my dad tries to kick him out or argue with him my mom is the one that ll stop him she s also the one that still asks me to do his laundry if he leaves it in the washer Even when we do his laundry he will leave it in the garage for weeks until someone mom takes it to his floor and puts it away from him Right now my parents are on vacation overseas visiting elderly family when they were leaving our washed died I was the one that bought the new washer set up the installation and removal I let everyone my brother included know that the washer was not be used we even unplugged it and moved it forward that the replacement would be and ready for use later that night He decides that s the day he s going to be proactive and replugs in the broken washer and starts washing clothes right at the start of the delivery window Inevitably his clothes stay soaked bc the washer is broken I let him know he can either take his clothes to the laundromat to dry or if he wants to use the dryer he has to set a 45 min timer and come back to restart the dryer He snaps at me that he ll just come back in 3 hours to do his laundry and that he s going to leave his soaking wet clothes in his fabric laundry basket I told him he can wait if he wants but his basket can t be in the garage because he won t clean up the giant puddle his clothes are going to inevitably make he starts yelling and arguing I m firm that I will not allow the clothes be in here He storms off to his truck reverse so fast and hard he almost falls into the ditch snd flips me off as he speeds away Originally I did put his clothes outside the garage but at my mom s request I put them in the dryer and dried them and flipped his fabric basket to dry in the sun Around the time I get notified the delivery is going to be there in 20 min I go out to move the cars and wait for the delivery he s out there calling our parents to complain that his laundry basket his upside down since I m already out there and annoyed by his behavior I tell him your clothes are drying and your basket is drying He starts yelling at me that he s not talking to me and ordering me to go inside I tell him I m in the space I need to be and he slams the phone an inch away from my face screaming at me that our mom told me to go inside My mom and dad both scream through the phone that HE needs to go inside He storms away screaming at them through the phone I complete the delivery dry his clothes and then take it to his door and leave it there at my mom s request Last couple days since the incident we ve been trying to stay away from each other and if we do see each other we do not speak but he doesn t glare and mutter something towards me We ve seen on the ring camera of him leaving and coming back inebriated This morning I was leaving for work and saw that his side of the garage door was wide open on the cameras it doesn t show him walking to the front But does show the door was open around 845p and stayed open till I closed it at 3a I can t say for sure he purposely opened it it s possible he pressed the button from his home on accident and just never closed it But it upsets me a lot because my homes entrance is through the garage We have so many tools and expensive equipment that could be damaged or stolen and I m thankful nothing happened but I hate that it was left open and now I have another thing on my checklist to take care of to make sure we stay safe and secure I m just exhausted I want peace I don t know what to do to bridge the gap or what I need to do for him to be more responsible I don t know if there is anything he will always throw in our face how we react to him but never acknowledge what he did He won t apologize he s never thanked us for anything we ve done to help him so I know an apology is never going to happen on the rare moments he s not a jerk he acts like everything is normal and that we re the bad ones for still being upset which leads to him getting aggressive and argumentative My husband wants to do a giant family meeting this Saturday after my parents get back to discuss the behavior and have an intervention But we ve had interventions with my brother before he ll half listen make empty promises and then continue the behavior I don t know thank you for letting me vent I m so tired between my family and work but I can t if I don t stay stepped up no one else will step in",,Female,mother

text body: So I ve never done one of these before and I m trying to determine if I m the asshole or I m not trying hard enough Here goes I m not using any names My partner and I have been together a long stretch both of us raised by grandparents ironically we bonded over dead moms and shitty dads my family are pretty standard mom died dad got a new family didn t really bother with us again not relevant to this though so moving on my partners parents both herion addicts dad always been buzzing round him during childhood did the whole shitty addict parent thing since we ve been adults we don t have anything to do with his dad The issue is his mom my MIL I can t help but hold a tonne of resentment towards her Here s why I ll start from the start So my MIL had my partner when she was 15 16 when he was 2 3 I was always told from his nan on dads side that me day she knocked her door pretty much said I don t want him anymore and left his dad years later told him she d died and he grew up believing she was dead his nan raised him Fast forward to us having our first child together and we get a knock on the door surprise surprise it s partners dead mom apparently she d heard she d had a grandson from my partners dad and she was getting clean and wanted to build bridges took us by shock beyond shock My partner wants to give things a go understandable at the time I didn t know what to do or say I d never ever been in a situation like this before I had a very standard very as you d say normal up bringing almost sheltered I knew nothing about addiction I did however have my guard up because I wanted to protect our child you know just incase My partner very overwhelmed with his dad crawling back in his mom turning up I think a lot of trauma got brought up and he had a mental break down police got involved and it meant for a period of time he couldn t live with us and regrettably ended up living with his mom who he s known was alive for 3 months and who d only been clean for 3 months for the first time in 17 years While he s living there she continues to stay clean and her and I formed a very good bond almost I guess you could say it was too much we almost saw each other every other day did everything together she bonded really well with my child was really proving herself and we were supporting mentally being there trying to be there for her in anyway we could she got back in touch with her mom and dad her were young so they were great grandparents to my child but really more like grandparents It was working it was odd but it was working I think I clung to her in a sense because I didn t have my mom and I think she did the same because she just needed someone About six months in she started seeing this man and decided she was gonna move in with him partner still on bail had to go with her Things were fine there for abit she was still on methadone and then the partner that she was with was an alcoholic a functioning one had a ful time job worked hard kept his home etc but drank a lot MIL while still on the methadone also started drinking at first just a little bit then it started to get out of control she would go on these benders and go missing for days literally wouldn t here off her sometimes three days sometimes ten days like the boyfriend she was with would lock her out she would break into the house to get in in the end Then after Christmas of 21 she went out on one of her benders and just didn t come back she was back on the gear and that was that I m just going to mention that while she was drinking she was not a nice person not a happy drunk I mean she was a cruel nasty drunk My partner works and she d come back sometimes at 2am I d have him phoning me crying because she d come in drunk and started on him even hit him start fights with my partner her son she d start fights with her boyfriend the one night he thought they d both died because she threw her and boyfriend downstairs the stairs it was like this almost every night for 4 months until partner came home My partner went to court and charges were dropped as it was deemed what he needed was mental health support rather than all the crap Great he was home life could get back to normal The following Christmas we found out we were pregnant with our second child around the same time we bumped into MIL ex boyfriend who d told us he d seen her she was on deaths door and would be lucky to last past Xmas this sent alarms bells off in our heads and for a few weeks we went back and forth on weather to reach out we did I m still debating weather it was one of the worst decisions of our lives so we reach out my partner text her That night I couldn t sleep I phoned her I was on the phone three hours basically saying don t bother messaging partner back if your just gonna hurt him again swore blind that wasn t the case Two days later we went and met her without our child just incase she said she was trying to get clean again anyway before she reached out to us but didn t wanna live this life anymore so we said right Ok let s really rally together let s do what we can let s get it right this time it s not gonna be a straight line but we can do this together we actually got closer then we did the first time she was down to be my second birthing partner obvs partner was first like we got really close and I think we both relied on each other too much I was doing the things with her I couldn t do with my own mom I think she was over compensating even though we kept saying she didn t need too just baby steps Towards the last trimester of my pregnancy she started seeing this bloke that was still an active addict and she started drinking again but it didn t affect us as partner wasn t living with her we just knew she was turning up to us with black eyes or not hearing off her for days again she was still on methadone and started going on benders before patterns started to repeat we sat her down and said look if this keeps on your gonna go down the same rabbit hole and your gonna loose everything you ve just built back up we all had a cry including her and she said yep she can see what we mean and she definitely thought that this bloke she was seeing was bad news as there were constantly drinking fighting each other and it was altogether a toxic situation She asked us please not to take her off the birth plan I was hesitant but I kinda thought maybe just maybe this would like cement things for her to get her really on track to be like you ve just seen your grandchild come into the world like come one you ve got this this is special you know She attends the birth Things started to go downhill there was first little things that she kept saying like I could do this I could have another baby we thought nothing of it at first thought it was a joke After having baby I was very very sick I ended up back in hospital and she d keep on with all these promises and they kept falling through and then she came to the hospital two black eyes all cut up she d been with this new addict boyfriend fighting and drinking again we straight up said nope nothing doing this again we ve jus thad a baby im too sick to be dealing with this we know where it s going we backed off abit we didn t cut ties we just were focusing on us our new addition and me getting better In the end a fight broke out and we did cut contact well between partner and MIL I kept in touch just incase like I was routing for her to pull through and sort herself out Christmas 23 I get a text can you tell patner I m pregnant due in May I read it I literally thought wtf we worked it out she literally got pregnant two weeks after I d had our baby Coincidence Partner was heartbroken I mean like I obvs had to tell him he came back from work literally broke down crying and said how could she do this don t get me wrong she was his mom by blood however to him he always said she was more like a friend not really his mom she isn t a very maternal type if you get my drift We don t really have any contact for a while then she reaches out to partner and they try build bridges I am completely against it however it s not my mom I can keep my children away from it which I did and have done they don t really have anything to do with her but I ll get on to that in abit So she s pregnant we start seeing her again abit and we find out the boyfriend she s pregnant by the one that s still an active user we aren t sure 100 on details but it turns out that the whole time she s been pregnant and we ve seen her pregnant she s been drinking still on methadone and fighting Please don t ask how she hid the drinking during the pregnancy I don t know it never got picked up no one has ever been involved with her social services wise nothing she turns up to our eldest birthday party 5 days before her due date can in one hand fag in another everyone drink counted her while she was there because everyone was completely gobsmacked even us and it was about 9 11 pints she had and as I stated before she s not one for just having one she tends to go on benders after and I m bit of a believer in patterns repeating Fast forward she has the baby normal birth heathy baby Sod s Law I actually dunno how she did it with how much she was drinking She ends up moving to a flat within a five min walk from our house everything is fine for abit she isn t seeing the addict boyfriend until all of a sudden she is and then it turns out she s drinking constantly and fighting with him all the time she says she can t phone the police because there s warrants out for her arrest He says she s doing drugs she says he s a liar She lies about having him round because her parents said if she does they will wash her hands of the situation because there s a child involved and she lies about it because when I say her mother literally buys everything for that child I mean everything she s drunkly said to me she s drinking all the time she s finding motherhood too much and combined with constantly having the addiction boyfriend there then not there drinking fighting it s just another cycle We keep our distance it s difficult for us because our children are very bonded to MIL parents my partner s grandparents so we kinda have to keep the peace because they are under the impression that MIL is sober clean and not doing anything risky so to speak and I can t blab because in all honestly I m a little scared of them they aren t ones for sitting down and talking finding the middle ground and conflict resolution they are more ignore the problem until it becomes a huge problem and explodes into utter chaos and if you question there might be an issue you get shut down and told to mind your own so reaching out isn t really an option I just make sure that my children are protected and kept away from it which they are my eldest who s old enough to remember MIL doesn t really bother with her when we do have to see her and my youngest hasn t really got a clue who she is My question is I suppose I m a being the asshole because I feel I ve given chance after chance tried to be there give support I ve kept things brief because it s so long anyway let alone if I went into every little detail because I can t help have this unbelievable amount of hate towards her to see how much she s hurt my partner he s such a good soul he really is and she has just shit in him I mean for example since having her new baby she doesn t bother with him at all like not even the odd text even when we have to see her she doesn t bother even trying to have a conversation it s just constantly trying to shove the new baby under his nose and then get his approval that she can be a good mom Which I find insulting to him after what she s repeatedly done to him I also have hate that like now it s all about her new baby or nothing like my children get completely pushed out the way and shoved to the side which I m not jealous of the new baby its more how she goes about it she literally told me that my youngest is forgotten about because she s the middle child ours if the three of them my eldest my youngest and her new baby which I just is shitty I just don t know weather I m holding on to grudges and should cut her some slack or if I m justified and should set fire to the whole fucking thing because the idea of when I next have to see her boils my blood I know this is long but I ve been holding this in for nearly 5 years and believe it or not this is brief and leaving out alot of details If you have any questions I will answer them I m not one for not",,,

text body: I am father of two girls ages 6 and 8 and my wife is currently 7 months pregnant Since I started my relationship with my wife at age 20 I knew I wanted three children During these first eight years of parenthood I have been absolutely happy and completely satisfied I always felt fulfilled and content I never had any negative thoughts about having two daughters even knowing all the things I couldn t do with them I ve dedicated my entire life to soccer for example Since we learned the third baby would be a girl I have had a strong feeling of disappointment that five months later I still haven t been able to overcome It s deep and lasting I m afraid it will turn into depression What hurts me most is a profound feeling of rejection It s as if I ve always been part of a family unit and now I ve been expelled or rejected from that unit I see myself as outside the group of four of them I see myself as different I see my wife as 100 compatible and agreeing on everything but I m let s say 50 My wife can talk to them about how she did things as a child she gives them her childhood toys to play with they share clothes I see that everything I do now has no meaning This gives me a deep feeling of inferiority to my wife and makes me feel small and insignificant I feel like I have to do all my hobbies alone away from my family My hobbies and I go one way and my family go another and we ll never be able to coincide I even feel punished by nature or by God because they don t want there to be a continuity of me I know that my daughters are my daughters but I see how if a woman has 3 daughters and I have none because they are like a photocopy of her I have even come to feel like I hate being a man I feel like it s wrong my whole masculinity But it s only because I see that as the reason for my exclusion from my family of 4 women I am very sad and have no motivation for the future I have always been a strong and determined person I had my life plan very clear until now But now it is the opposite I don t see where I can get the satisfaction I had before And I know that parenthood is not about satisfying fathers and mothers but about providing children with all the love and affection they need But I have to watch soccer by myself at home in another room I try hard but I don t manage to share hobbies with my daughters they only want dresses make up and these things that I respect but I don t know anything about When we go on a weekend trip it is very humiliating for me because I spend the whole trip in clothing and jewelry stores holding the bags by myself and waiting for them to finish I m like their accompanying servant who doesn t matter I am deeply envious of all the male parents who have male children so they can have company and give continuity to their life their experience their hobbies and interests The one I envy the most is my own father because he has always had a very impacting and excessively heavy role in my life sometimes for good sometimes for bad People I know friends etc all make joking but deeply painful comments to me One person even said to me I sympathize with you the expression you say in Spain when someone in your family has died Just for the fact that I had to live with 4 women for the rest of my life Also my wife told me Dad needs a dog and that hurts me deeply because it means just that that I am not part of her group and I need another companion And if she says it it hurts me even more I guess I didn t know it but I had an expectation And now when it hasn t been fulfilled it s very painful I always wanted a big family so I wouldn t feel alone I now feel very lonely and pushed out of my own family And I also want to say that I have a huge guilt for not being 100 happy and for seeing my wife endure the whole pregnancy and not me I would say as well that there is no sexism on that I have always been more feminist than my wife is I am very happy to have a third baby and I know I will love him and have no problem with the 3 girls personally But I can t stand the place this situation puts me in and all the things I have to give up Has anyone gone through anything similar any suggestions for improvement Any opinions for the purpose of improvement would be appreciated",28,Male,father

author: Irisflowerfs25
text body: Hi I came to Reddit solely for the fact that I desperately needed to get this off my chest and maybe to hear what others think of it My little sister is growing up I am aware of this I made peace with it I made peace with the fact that the sister whom I hated would grow up hate me for the shit I ve done to her and involved her with lose the spark in her eyes and maybe not consider me as her family anymore I ve made peace with all the negative outcomes that will come back to bite me in the ass But no I guess I was wrong She still loves me she told me herself That should be a good thing but it s not How could she love so easily I hate it Is she doing this to make me feel even more guilty Does she know what I think of every time I look at her and realise Fuck Are you really my family I want to start out like this and I m sorry if it doesn t make sense English is not my first language Let s call my sister Betty just a nickname as the rules say Of course obviously I am the firstborn of a father who s a trash junkie and a hardheaded mother who worked her ass off as a waitress Again obviously nothing good comes out of raising me when my parents are like that And Betty is the youngest The first time I laid my eyes on her Betty my mother in the bathtub my father probably somewhere fetching towels I had been filled with some sort of distrust I wasn t angry Nor was I disgusted It Felt off I didn t know what to feel it s just so confusing Betty wasn t the favorite None of us were the favourite because we received equal treatment although a little less extreme when it came to her because she was the youngest Not that I minded I wasn t jealous I knew I deserved it because of my actions when I was still a teenager that included me having to be at parties making out with my boyfriend stealing money from Mother s old leathery purse and trying what my father did because why the hell would he care If I had a kid like that I would ve made the decision of quitting on them but how would I know I don t have a kid to begin with Anywho Betty was always kind sweet but not naive She knew that what was happening isn t what you call the way to parenting Or something I don t know Sweet young Betty did what she could to make it less worse for me When it came to me having to be locked in the basement with only the trash bags and the old shit my grandma stored in there my younger always made it her mission to take care of me without having to let our parents know I being the angsty teenager that I am would always cuss her out and shove her out of the basement but it wouldn t work Betty was stubborn Each time she d sneak into father s room and grab the key to the basement It s 50 50 But mostly Not so 50 50 because before she could even deliver me the canned food or whatever she had on her hands Father would wake up and slap the hell out of her How do I know Betty s cries were much louder than my own hands banging the door begging to be let open I was a bitch She wasn t She followed me around like a lost puppy showing me the cool rock she found somewhere in the backyard giving me pennies that she saved up when I was trying to find some money for one stick of cigarette to which I would gladly take and food she d give me food And in return I d swear at her push her away and if I wasn t really in the mood I d hit her But she just bounces back up like Nothing happened to her I don t remember much anymore It s blurry I was drunk and I knew it was a warm night I remember that I packed my things and probably gave the f bomb to my parents before slamming the door in their faces I swore to myself I m never coming back to that hell hole But one thing I remember most was when Betty gave me her jar of pennies I said that I don t remember much anymore but this one really stuck in my mind like a damn parasite The jar of pennies she gave me is probably somewhere in my room hidden away not a penny wasted I stayed at my boyfriend s house bless his heart until now I don t deserve him and his mom Surprisingly liked me kept telling me that if my boyfriend weren t her child she d love to have me as her own daughter We made a small business together now booming thanks to my boyfriend s mom helping us out The both of us managed to get an apartment together and I continued to pursue my studies courtesy of my boyfriend s mom too I love the both of them It s been years I haven t really thought of Betty much I was only reminded that I had a little sister when my phone gave me a text notification I m not sure if I should post it but to be safe I ll just copy it out and still use my sister s nickname as Betty and mine as Nora which is also my nickname Hi it s me Betty It s been a long time How are you I don t know if you will actually see my texts but I wish u can It s been a while I actually miss you hehe I just wanted to let you know I m still alive and kicking Okay that wasn t funny Haha Not my point I m basically talking to myself here now jeez Again not my point I love you Nora Pls take care of urself hugs and Theres more Theres more of it And then Something in me I just snapped I talked to my fiance yes now fiancé not boyfriend and again bless his heart he understood me when I said I wanted to go alone in this one and I would give him updates every 5 minutes I made the decision to visit my sister I really hate this But the house hasn t changed ever since Like time just stopped the day I left But not Betty No Betty grew And I hate it Betty actually grew But the fuck did I expect Did I expect the sweet girl that clinged to me wherever I went still be the same I mean She s still the same except less optimistic Or maybe that s what I m thinking I don t know It was awkward Terribly awkward But it was my fault anyway She did most of the talking She had told me that mother and father are out somewhere on their little mini vacation I Really don t want to say anything anymore I don t even know how I got to this point but Betty invited me to her piano concert or something I didn t know she played piano and could sing that well I didn t know she was THAT fucking good Out of all the people that sat and watched her I was the only one who didn t clap Many people cheered for her in the back And as she went down the stage her friends to what I assume came running at her and almost tackled her to the ground Even in the midst of all the cheering the hugs and the kisses on her cheeks that came from her friends she stared at me She smiled and waved at me It was sad Her smile was so sad Like she was glad that I was here I vaguely remember waving back at her but never returning the smile Only then did I realise that Betty actually made a life that I never witnessed When I should ve been there to defend her from a bully taught her how to do her hair given her some make up that I owned been protective of her when she had a date given her advice on how to deal with her cramps and been there to comfort her with her first break it had all been dealt with by someone who knew better and had actually been there for her worse she dealt with it herself That night we went to a crappy Chinese restaurant My treat And that night was the most she s gotten comfortable enough to snort at the dry jokes I made talk without restraint and give me some of the food she didn t want That s a lie There s not a food Betty wouldn t like We came home that night Or I don t know just walked her there I made a promise to my fiance that I would be back home I always keep my promises I didn t miss the look of sadness that made its way onto Betty s face and I just wanted to turn my face away and ignore everything For some reason I was the one who initiated the hug She wrapped her arms around me She told me she loves me Betty told me she understood that I have my own life now and how I shouldn t worry for her anymore That s all I went back to the apartment and cried in the shower I hate her I hated her for making me feel this way Everything was perfect and she had to ruin it I thought that the mistakes I made were already gone and yet Betty climbed her way up to the top and laughed at me She shouldn t say that I shouldn t be worried for her anymore I hate her fuck I really hate her I love you Betty But you made it hell for me I shouldn t have been your sister I shouldn t have to burden myself with the thought that you found someone in replacement of me I shouldn t have gave you that hug I shouldn t have come home I hate how we look like each other so much I hate how you are the version of what I am if I just knew better and didn t let my thoughts get to the better of me",,,sibling

text body: Hi everyone I just wanted to vent about this situation that happened to me just recently because I don t know what to do I m a 25 year old Mexican woman I live with my mom my parents divorced back in 2019 two younger brothers I m the eldest the second is 22 the youngest is 20 My brother who s 22 let s call him A has always bullied belittled me for years I think it started when he began high school he would bully me constantly about my weight I m on the chubbier side but since then I ve lost weight looks personality just basically anything about me tbh He does this to my mom sometimes to my younger brother but he mostly does it to me my mom He s always made fun of fatter women or fatter people in general but it s mostly towards women always makes comments towards random overweight women he sees out in public usually making fun of their appearance My brother didn t graduate high school dropped out but eventually got his GED years later During those years in between he did nothing he wouldn t take showers just played on his PS4 bullied me my mom etc I know this could be a sign of depression or some type of mental health issue but whenever my mom or I would try to talk to him about it he wouldn t care or acknowledge it even would respond by saying cruel or mean things to escape the topic As of lately things have gotten worse with my brother His favorite thing to call me now is a pervert Claiming that I am one whenever I try to give him a hug or show any affection towards him like patting his back or ruffling his hair playfully He hates physical contact or affection from me or my mom or pretty much anyone He makes weird remarks when we re arguing like oh I know what you do in your room I watch you through your window or oh I read your dairy I know what you re doing saying And at first I m thinking he s saying those things to just make me mad but what kind of normal brother says that to their only sister So this morning my brother was in my grandma s bathroom because me and my grandma share a bathroom since are rooms are next to each other Apparently my brother was using it but I didn t know I had thought it was my grandma she s hard of hearing so I was lightly knocking because it was early in the morning it was 8am or 9am and sometimes I do open the restroom a little bit because she s fallen asleep on the on the toilet several times before or she can t hear me in general unless I crack the door open a bit to speak into the bathroom All of a sudden my brother is hollering that I m a PERVERT And I m like why didn t you say anything when I knocked I was literally jiggling the door knob around But he just kept hollering that I m a pervert I just told him to shut the fuck up I went back to my room to wait for him to get out He gets out I m able to shower get ready for school I go to college When I came back from school my brother A is already on my ass about something stupid then he starts calling me a pervert again I m FED UP so I go to tell my mom hey your son is literally calling me a pervert he s claiming that I m trying to see him in the restroom because if you re calling me a pervert it s because you re claiming that I m doing something perverted like as if I m trying to watch you use the fucking restroom And you know what my mom does Instead of telling him hey what the hell is wrong with you why are you saying that to your sister She starts lecturing ME she starts calling ME a weirdo she starts telling me oh you don t do this in the house you don t help me Mind you I ve financially supported this family after she my dad divorced since I was 19 because she s an immigrant can t work And I m like how are you gonna lecture me I m literally telling how inappropriate your son is being to me But she doesn t care and just turns everything on me doesn t tell my brother anything I seriously cannot imagine my friends brothers saying these things to them Like what is this behavior I tell people I tell them the way that he is I ve even told my therapist and everyone says this is clearly not normal Yet I am the scapegoat I am the black sheep I m the one my mom is gonna lash out on and lecture not my brother just me I honestly do not know what the fuck to even say or do anymore This is constant I m trying to move out but I live in CA it s just so hard I just feel so alone ashamed Ashamed that this is my family I d appreciate if anyone could spare some advice or comment their observations Hell maybe you ll even relate but anyways I ll just leave this here",25,Female,sister

text body: Hi Reddit I need some honest advice and insight This is hard to write but here goes My older brother was abusive to me in early childhood some of it was intimate in nature between the ages of 4 to 6 I ve carried that silently for years On top of that I was bullied a lot growing up Strangely from around age 10 through my late teens my brother and I grew closer I think I was clinging to any sense of family or connection I could get But during COVID when I really needed him we were housemates then he abandoned me left me to clean up pay off rent and sell everything in the apartment No proper goodbye no closure just gone He s now in a new relationship my partner and I both feel off about his girlfriend though it s hard to explain why Suddenly he s making good money after years of being broke even borrowing from me and my parents in the past Now he s paying for our parents dinners fixing their car and playing this good son role He s reached out before claiming he wants to rebuild But every time he s done that he s overstepped boundaries minimized the past or ignored my attempts to explain how I feel However he has heard my words and is now not pushing as much because it would upset me that he didn t listen Now he only calls if he needs something and doesn t push He does hide his work information from me though although everyone in the family knows what he does Part of me wonders if this new generous version of him is just an act because he finally has money Another part of me is asking whether it s possible or even healthy to reconcile at all especially given what happened when I was a child Has anyone gone through anything remotely similar How do you know if someone truly wants to change or if you re being pulled back into a toxic dynamic just dressed up with nice dinners and gifts Any help or reflections would be really appreciated",,,sibling

while in town Lily s Dad Lily s father who had an affair with his co worker Pearl Pearl aka my Great Aunt Pearl who had an affair with Lily s Dad Aunt Maggie my mother s sister I 30F flew 1 380 miles one weekend to visit my Grandmother Mabel my mom s stepmom for her 80th birthday I ve known her my whole life and have a loving relationship with her My family who still live in that city my grandfather s sister Great Aunt Pearl and my Aunt Maggie have NOT recognized her as part of the family since my grandfather passed in 2013 So my Grandmother does not have a close relationship with her sister in law nor her step daughters my mother and aunt My Grandmother Mebel has her brother s side of the family nearby so she has her own family support system I haven t visited in 6 years and was only staying for the weekend I didn t want my time being pulled to visit other family as I wanted to visit her and I have a better relationship with my Grandmother as we talk at least once a week My Great Aunt Pearl lives across town but we re not close To avoid drama I told those involved that I wouldn t be posting about the trip nor trying to meet up with other family because my Grandmother s 80th birthday was my priority Knowing I d be in town I did reach out to a childhood friend Lily I ve stayed in touch with after all these years We hadn t seen each other since middle school as we both went to different high schools and my family moved out of state I told her not to tell anyone I was in town and we met up for brunch on my LAST DAY and she dropped me off at the airport We caught up on life like how she moved back in with her parents recently after a breakup ect She understood not to tell anyone I was in town About a week later I got a furious text from Great Aunt Pearl saying she was humiliated that she heard about my visit from a coworker and shamed me for not stopping by Confused I reached out to Lily and asked if she worked with my Great Aunt Pearl That s when the entire situation exploded That s how I found out my Great Aunt Pearl had been caught having an affair with Lily s dad when we were in high school Her dad played guitar at their church and Pearl was in the choir That s supposedly how they met and used late nights or fake practices for their affair When he was caught having an affair Lily s parents agreed to stay together do marriage counseling and switched churches Lily s dad promised to cut off all contact with his affair partner Pearl my Great Aunt But the double secret was that they were actually co workers who just so happened to be active in their churches So even after all these years he was still in communication with his affair partner as she was his coworker and he NEVER told his wife Here s the timeline I fly in for the weekend for my Grandmother s 80th birthday Visit Lily who takes me to the airport on my last day Lily tells her parents we caught up Lily s dad tells his co worker Pearl my daughter hung out with your great neice My Great Aunt Pearl texts me furious I ask Lily if she works with my Great Aunt Pearl Lily and I realize that her dad is coworkers with my Great Aunt Pearl Lily tells her mother and everything blows up Now my Great Aunt Pearl is posting about me on social media calling me toxic and a liar saying I destroyed a family with my lies Some extended relatives have unfriended me online and are taking her side I had no idea about the past affair not did I ever share about it online I just asked my friend Lily if my upset Great Aunt Pearl was her co worker But I had no idea that any of this would happen while visiting my Grandmother for her special 80th birthday All I was trying to do was figure out who told my Great Aunt I had been in town I would have never imagined that anything like this would happen I feel devastated for my friend but now I m being blamed for ruining their family by stirring up the past and accidentally revealing that my religious aunt had an affair with a married man My Aunt Maggie says I should have kept my mouth shut but I wasn t the one who cheated I didn t spread gossip I just got caught in the crossfire of someone else s secrets My friend Lily made the decision to tell her mother Not that I was trying to cause any problems I didn t even know her father knew my Great Aunt I feel terrible for Lily who now thinks her parents may actually divorce over this We re still close and I m trying to support her the best I can But I m also dealing with fallout in my own family My Great Aunt Pearl had disowned me publicly on social media She is spreading her own narrative about me calling me a homewrecker and I have several other family members like my Aunt Maggie siding with her As far as I know the affair was in the past and it stopped when they were caught However they stayed secret co workers and he has stayed loyal to his wife ever since I m not accusing anyone of cheating I just found out that they were coworkers They re own past decisions to keep the co worker relations a secret after the affair is what caught up to them but I m being punished for exposing them",30,Female,

author: wtevr134
text body: Throwaway account So my parents have never really been discreet about their sexual life As I was young 10 to 14 it was smacking on my mom s ass inappropriate talk mostly from my stepdad s side jokes of the same sort etc all in front of me I did not really understand the problem with it since I was a kid but as I became older it made me uncomfortable I tried to ask my parents to tone it down but my concerns were mostly dismissed On top of everything every once in a while a year or so I was already around 13 when it began my stepdad brought up a conversation about how I should be careful with meeting people basically not to sleep around because it s different for girls than for boys So the first time it really crossed the line was when I was about 14 My stepdad had that thing of telling my mom not to provoke him when she passed by him and then proceeded to smack her ass It was weird but tolerable at the moment Onto the case he was leaving for work I was in the kitchen by refrigerator reaching for something He went by looked at me and said name don t provoke me and laughed He did not touch me did not do anything else just left and as soon as the door closed I became histerical I called my mom in tears told her what happened She tried to calm me down said she d talk to him and assured me he did not mean that this way To him quote it was not the same He never thought of this comment in this way towards me because if he did you know I d never stay with him I believe it was true that if she ever thought he posed a threat to my wellbeing she would have left him In every crucial turn she always chose me over him and I do not question her motherly love or responsibility She did speak to S stepdad though I refused to be present Me and him basically didn t talk for a few weeks however the situation with comment never occurred again For the context S grew up very poor his own stepfather has been beating him his mother and little brother for whom he took the hits There were other issues such as his stepfather s alcoholism etc So I understand why the idea of boundaries and what is considered normal in the family for S were very distorted Other than that one comment he has never said or done anything and I mean anything inappropriate Still well sex jokes have always been his default kind of humour with literally anybody his friends colleagues even my mother s side of the family YES SOMETIMES EVEN HER PARENTS MY GRANDPARENTS To his credit when my mom explained to him that it was inappropriate he did tone it down mostly at least pot humour is still his second go to setting Regardless the fact that I understand all of it now the damage at the moment has been done and I believe it served as a trigger point The thing is I have a long standing issues with intrusive thoughts and repetitive actions checking the locks for 7 10 times in a row repositioning things solely based on feeling touching my books only after washing hands with soap thinking I might die before I go to sleep if I don t leave a Full glass of water on a nightstand to save me in case etc but there things took a turn for the worst Once a picture was in my head I couldn t get it out The thought of a parental figure in sexual context was stuck in front of my eyes and no matter how hard I tried I couldn t get it out It made me question many things Did I like to see it Did I want to see it Is there something wrong with me Is it something I want Looking at it in retrospect of course I didn t It made me feel sick and disgusted to the point of histerical crying and wanting to peel my skin off it made me feel horrible as if there was something wrong with me The thing is I knew I did not want to think of them in this way It was not a hidden desire it was not something that I wanted for f s sake I was 14 but I was trying to make sure I was 100 right about it so the thoughts kept reappearing in front of my eyes so I kept questioning myself over and over again I felt nauseous every single time yet I thought maybe that s what I actually wanted and if I acknowledged it I could deal with it But then when I really thought of it I did not want anything to actually happen so I knew what I knew from the beginning it wasn t what I wanted So jokes on me because the more I went in circles the stronger neurological connections in my brain became the more it appeared in front of me Meanwhile the war started S became a soldier we re Ukrainians and in the first couple of days I won t describe amount of stress we all were under my mom became a part of those intrusive thoughts too I have no idea why But I spiralled again this time even worse So it was all circled Sometime a year after I already knew that those were the intrusive thoughts not what I secretly wanted but the problem was far from getting solved because at that time S started to come home every couple of months I was very happy that he was alive and well he practically raised me after all and regardless of our many differences not only this one but others unrelated to topic dialogues we were close It happened once he got home once and at night my parents did not close the door When I went to shower in the ten seconds it took to cross a corridor I Have heard Enough Not only the image clear and LOUD in front of me but there was an audio now no avoiding it So I spiralled AGAIN to the point where every time S came home most of the nights I slept over at my friend s house It did not become better when I told them to close the damn door because S suggested to do it in the morning to which my mom replied that she hates morning sex what in the actual f mum I m still here Looking back it sounds silly but at the moment it made me feel like shit The environment of the people you used to know dying only made it far more surreal everything was so confusing and most of the time you were stuck with the same people for months I never thought of ending everything sui but sometimes all those things made me want for all of it to stop Stop being so disgusted with myself stop thinking about things that brought me nothing but tears and desire to puke Things that I have never wanted to think about in the first place before they were put right freaking in front of me and my brain just fixated on it and every time I almost managed to make it let it go something would happen again I was 14 to 17 years old It wasn t supposed to happen to me and I ve never heard of anything similar happening to someone else so I had no idea how to deal with it I lashed out on the parents once so they finally shut it down practically entirely but it didn t exactly bring me closure or anything My mother suggested therapist and this is the first time I put that in writing in four or five years so maybe I ll give it a try I have my reservations because my last attempt with a shrink got so bad it made a dinner story of how NOT to go to a shrink but I can put it aside I m 18 now and moved to uni quite some time ago I no longer question those thoughts There are months I can go on without a single one but sometimes there are weeks when they just reappear randomly or on the contrary at the moments I would love never to have them What I hate the most perhaps is when a certain thought gets stuck with an association to a mundane thing and thus keeps reappearing All of that really messed with my head and my perception of sex so I ll appreciate any advice on the topic Thanks",18,,

text body: I would really appreciate if anyone could give some helpful tips or ideas of how to go about this please This is my first time ever posting on reddit though I m a big fan of reading people s issues and trying to help where I can This is just a throwaway account not that I think my family will see it they re not the reddit type Important things to note about the situation I am currently in the application process for the navy and certain circumstances have caused my partner and I to expedite the process of marriage We both agreed that it was something that would happen eventually down the line but we have only been dating around a year We both decided to be pragmatic and have an elopement with only two witnesses no parents at the ceremony itself to keep things fair Of course we told all 4 of our parents and they were all completely fine with the situation they understand the reasoning with the navy and can see that we are completely enamoured with each other We were witnessed by our best friends one of each Another important note is that my brother has been in a toxic relationship with a woman my entire family despises for over 2 years now It s been very hard to watch especially with how she treats him but I ve tried to support him by just being his brother and when I try to talk to him about it he shuts me out and refuses to tell me how he feels I ve kept my mouth shut about what I think of his partner and his relationship as that s not my place to say anything about All I can do is be the person that s happy to see him and support him If anyone wants further details I ll make an updated post with specifics Anyway to the crux of the issue I 25M just got married on Sunday it s Tuesday at the time of posting after a short but very sweet honeymoon with my now wife 29F I have been working with my brother 30M in another state about a 5 hour flight from home I worked with him for 3 weeks of every month and would take time to see my partner During that time he had a LOT to say about my relationship including some extremely disrespectful things about my partner most of which came during a rather interesting conversation about the things she wears I won t get into details but it infuriated me and hurt my partner s feelings a lot This obviously sucked and when I got home I searched for a job found one and then informed my brother I would not be coming back up to work with him He took this fine and he has no clue that I still feel upset with him due to other reasons including work and money troubles whilst I was there In any case as aforementioned he has been really struggling with work and particularly money lately and has organised some work with a big company that he was getting ready for just before my wedding Now to get to the part that makes me want to change my last name I have always had a particular dynamic with my father He has never been absent but he has a problem with showing up He fell asleep in the waiting room when I was born forgot about important events and was always late didn t turn up at all Eventually my mum got sick of it and divorced him when I was in kindergarten when he didn t show up for my Xmas party he fell asleep on the couch because he was tired from work my mother also worked full time and has continued to as a single mother to this day In any case this theme continued for the rest of my childhood football games parties you name it he would always say he would be there and when the time came no dad I genuinely didn t mind after a while I understood he was busy and had a life and he was a great dad whenever I was actually spending time with him I never needed him to show up to my things because I m quite independent as a person and didn t think most of the stuff was important enough for him to be there anyway Usually the only thing that would piss me off about it was that he would say he d be there then not come I have thought that he s been turning a new leaf lately as he has seemed a lot more involved in my life He s been supportive of the marriage seemed very excited about it and to celebrate with me This made me quite happy and he even suggested I host a party for family seems how the ceremony is small and they couldn t come I thought this was a great idea and so I organised it all inviting my partners side of the family to come and getting everyone on board My mother also invited her side of the family who my partner and I love and get along with very well Well I call my father 3 days after the initial conversation about the party to confirm it s organised he knew the exact day and date already and he goes oh shit Apparently his friends go mountain bike riding for a weekend in another state every year and one of them bailed out and called my dad to see if he wanted the ticket all expenses paid Him being in his own words his selfish self accepted this wonderful offer completely forgetting about his son s impending wedding party of which the actual wedding was the day after He then says he has that and can t come I was a bit taken aback but I want him to come to my wedding party because he wants to not because I told him he has to so I told him he can do that if he wants At the time I thought it wouldn t really bother me too much because it s a running theme in my life anyway and he still had the rest of the week to reconsider Well surprise surprise he didn t show up It was only when my uncle who is extremely unreliable showed up to my party because he heard it was on and dropped everything last minute that it hit me My father had every opportunity to come to the party and chose not to My uncle who is a chronic alcoholic and hated by half of the family was there to support me and show me love despite being busy that day To really top things off my mother invited to fly my brother down for the weekend for free to be there for the party and to spend time with family he s been having issues with his partner He also declined saying he was too busy with getting ready for the big job This coupled with the disrespect he s shown me lately really got to me I can t lie Both my brother and my father share my last name My mother has always been there for me and always shown up even when she didn t have to She s the most amazing person in my life bar my wife who understands me better than any human ever has I m already fairly certain I want to change my last name to my mother s and my wife agrees that she wants that name more anyway The real problem is how the fuck do I broach this subject with my brother and particularly my father without causing a massive rift Don t get me wrong I don t give a shit if they re upset about it they re going to be upset anyway I ve had it with being the bigger person keeping the peace and pretending nothing is wrong I haven t spoken up about being mad at my brother because he s going through a lot right now and I didn t want to add to it but I can t ignore that he s really done me wrong What I do really care about is not permanently harming my relationship with them I want to find a way to broach it that s not spiteful I was thinking of mentioning that because I believe my wife is my equal I find it fair for both of us to change our last names Seems how her parents are still together there s only one last name we could both change to my mother s which she loves and she s fully on board with it Please if I could get some advice on how to go about talking to my father and to a lesser degree my brother about changing my last name from theirs Sorry for the long post and again I can update with any further information context if I missed anything",25,Male,brother

text body: I 22 F and my fiancé 24 M just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that Since the very beginning of our relationship it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother 62 F Now it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding Let me explain After my now fiancé and I began dating I began to tell my mom about him since I was obviously excited about this new relationship Some of her biggest gripes were that he s nothing more in her mind than a backwoods redneck and essentially that I m too good for him But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long time Jehovah s Witnesses Ever since I told her this she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had Example A She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up I told her no it really wasn t his thing and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork construction that he does now and never took much of an interest in sports She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn t done any sports since he couldn t do anything that would put him around being people that weren t JW I know this is true within the religion but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young I ve tried to explain this as not true but she simply won t accept it Example B I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in After dating for almost a year I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living Ever since I ve moved and especially after I told her about our engagement all she does is say that I ve been sucked in She s convinced I m in a cult She s also said she hates my ex boyfriend who cheated on me to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him Example C Since starting working post college I ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into fundraising and I haven t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before I ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home since I have learned that cleaning cooking and decorating are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall She says I m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from even after I had said many times I didn t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new and find a nice boy down there to settle down with Example D Since announcing our engagement she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare When I told her our initial wedding date she asked why we were rushing it I told her we just didn t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married She grilled me and said I must be pregnant and what happened to having a long engagement She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and or borderline personality disorder She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer we live 4 5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up she told me it was already too late this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating She s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family When we weren t speaking a couple months back she didn t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because I didn t ask how the dog was I never got a chance to say goodbye Before this she had previously called me at 12 30 am after we hadn t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent 10 000 at the casino Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should ve never asked All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself our relationship as he calls it When I told my mother the date she said it was too soon and that she didn t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn t help me with the wedding I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would and she said yes I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors While this was true after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship Ever since we ve been arguing pretty consistently The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement He s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I m in But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I m going to be loyal to him not to my mom The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some and he s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to since it is a small town here My in laws are absolutely incredible and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom We often go out to lunch together and just spend a lot of time together overall Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing My mom is my only family since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn t close with any of her siblings and all my grandparents are gone I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else How do I prove myself to my fiancé How do I stick up to my mother and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her Can I salvage a relationship with both of them My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me like being the parent that stayed when my dad left But I also love my fiancé more than anything and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us He s said he s just been in a down mood in general he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness I ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings Thank you in advance for any advice",22,Female,daughter

WERENT EVEN FIGHTING FOR THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE ITS PARTIALLY HER FAULT OUR FAMILY CANT GET ALONG OR AT LEAST BE TOLERANT TO ONE ANOTHER She says she doesn t know why J acts the way he does when she knows damn well he acts like the spitting image of her angry narcissistic self They re both too proud Obviously J goes to his room upset and crying and A goes to the couch and cries I give A space to relax and just go to sleep J is a different story I had a feeling I needed to get him to talk his feelings I enter his room and he doesn t say anything I kept going and slowly sat on his bed next to him and tried to give him a hug to maybe comfort him since he looked like he needed it He pulls away and starts crying and telling me to leave him the fuck alone That we were no longer his family and all of us can go to hell I had no part in the fight I stayed away and didn t jump in for anyone I wanted to let them have a fair fight and get their feelings out so I can understand why they re so mad at each other and can t get along J just keeps yelling and pulling away from me telling me to just leave him alone I obviously don t want to leave him alone because I want him to talk to me and tell me what s going on and why he feels so angry I kept trying and after 15 whole minutes of slowly started to cry and getting told off by him I left I know my family isn t perfect I know I am not perfect I know my mother isn t a good mother but I don t want my family to break apart I wish I could maybe get a family therapist and see what the problems are but my mom clearly wouldn t want to pay for that or even accept the idea of her being a bad parent and failing at her own parenting I have never genuinely hugged her for years I have never heard an I love you from her after I was 10 and ever since we moved from an apartment to a house she s gotten a job and is spending everyday at work My brothers are starting to blame each other for her not being home and think maybe she just doesn t want to deal with us She spends more time with her work friends than with us and my stepdad is too busy working his ass off in another state since he works on stuff like windmills around the states which is obviously meaning that he isn t home as often but he tries to be and tries to take my siblings to do things kids should do like go out for once and go play in a park My mom doesn t bother She never plans anything for her own children The person who plans everything is my stepdad He takes us and buys us things and my mom can barely even make time to take my youngest brother Jn to his speech therapy I seriously don t know what to do My siblings started thinking of me as their actual mom at this point since I m the one taking care of them while my mother hangs out at work like she doesn t have not one child but 4 children she is responsible for at home If she isn t capable of taking care of us why bother having 4 children I m barely 16 I m doing my best to try and keep things together I hate being this helpless and weak I wish I could do more I wish I wasn t scared to tell her what her problem is and how she is failing as a mother It s not that her job is the entire problem I don t mind that she has a job at all The problem is she works EVERYDAY Even on her days off WHAT PERSON WANTS TO WORK ON A DAY OFF She works every single fucking day of the week and even after work she still goes on the phone and calls her fucking work buddies instead of idk making us a actual meal instead of bringing left over fucking pizza that you had actually bought for work instead of us her children It s not even my brothers fault they can t get along It s all in the parent I know this is wrong of me but I missed when my mom actually spent time with us and the last time she spent time with us was before she got weight loss surgery and got a job I miss my mom when she was jobless fat and actually not making everything about her I miss my mom who would at least cook for us daily and try to spend time with us I miss when we were actually important to her That s when my brothers weren t fighting so badly and when everyone could stop having such hard feelings towards each other I wish I could get my brothers into better schools I hate how ghetto public schools are What happened to being a kid I just want my family to be close again To stop the constant fighting and to just try to talk to each other like normal families I don t want to feel helpless when asking for my family members to try and fix each other I m trying my hardest here I m crying in my room alone Unsure of how to fix this broken home I don t want my last of my teenage years crying over a broken family We don t have anyone I wish it was easier to accept a hug and some love I feel awkward when my mom tries to hug me I feel like I m in a house with complete strangers I know who my brothers are but I can t connect with them I know who my mother is but she won t connect with any of us and it makes it hard to connect to her Only thing helping me through is the goods times we rarely have At school it s an escape from how lonely my usually loud house is I hide through humor in front of my friends so I don t feel weak and helpless in front of them I seriously don t know what to do anymore I don t want to lose my family I hate being alone",16,,

text body: Right from birth maybe 3 months old Brenda put me in a garbage bag and threw me in the garbage I stopped breathing and they some how actually managed to save my life getting air back into me Since then she started doing all sorts of things that would put me in danger She undressed me walked out into the alley and sat me down then turned around went back inside to have an affair with a very very young person and then falling asleep Hoping that someone would come by and pick me up abducting me or running me over She would find complete strangers and let them borrow me for the day Then she would accuse them of molesting me touching me whatever it was and then collect money from them Or just get them sent to prison My recollection of this is quite fuzzy but I do know of a time she passed me over to a young man and woman inside the Dairy Queen in the mall in Brooks Alberta saying youre just gonna go with them for a bit They were walking around the mall with me telling people that I was their child Then I ended up in some dark dirty basement with the man undressing me He took off my shirt then got on his knees and took my pants off and then staring at my genitals The woman that was there then told him to comeover to where I was she had to show him something Then I dont know who it was maybe Brenda came storming in saying you leave him alone and picked me up carrying me outside to the car I asked what happened he was going to do something that he shouldnt be doing Got in the car and thats all I recall I was wearing black shorts and shirt with purple lettering on it Im starting to assume from that even that they were maybe collecting some sort of payment for what I dont know Since then Brenda has gotten family and friends all to take a turn usually holding a pillow over my face cutting off my air supply when I m sleeping She will have no idea what hes even talking about of course would you admit to doing something like that Probably not unless you wanted to go to jail that bad And it seems that everyone that has taken a turn doing it are no longer around no facebook no way to get a hold of them The first time I can recall it happening was when I was sleeping over at my friends house When I fell asleep they held a pillow over me and completely stopped me from breathing The mother had to come and breathe life back into me When I woke up my friends told me about what happened The one friends then said before we left your mom told us to do it I said she would never tell anyone to do it They then said she said if we do it she would buy us new skateboarding shoes I continued to say No way my mom would never tell you to do that with a shocked look in their eyes they said seriously but dont say we told you When I got home I asked my mom about it and with a smirk she said of course not Thats where my shares came from Everything she has used me for she has kept all the money or spent it on stuff like embarassing me or getting me beat up Evan has done it a couple times And he has also ran a hose from the exhaust to the cab of the truck I was passed out in almost killing me The next day and a few after Brenda would say shit like just go kill yourself or you should have just stayed in the truck She has got my friend Nick to do the pillow thing he told me And now cant get a hold of the guy anywhere When I was working in Dutchess she payed 10 000 to some guy to come out there and do the same thing The only thing that kept me alive this long is that she thought there was a Trust or some shit that was for me just so there would be people watching over me and she wouldnt want me dead so soon There was this one woman I was sort of dating but her and Brenda started getting along really good they were going to Brooks together and stuff One night we were drinking and her and Brenda gave me this pill or something for me to take Next thing I knew is I woke up in the hospital in Lethbridge Right away Brenda said that you should make a personal trust she thought this because just incase I needed to transfer over assets really fast She had a lawyer come down and fill one out When he left he took a copy for himself and another copy went to the nurse to keep with my file just incase we needed to reference it later it would be a safe place to keep it I called down to ask them about it but they wont let me know anything I have to be there in person But Im guessing by now that Brenda either had a friend that works there go in and take it out or Evan had his sister Aleita go in and take it Most likely switching it up and putting Mason on there since he was also at the hospital No matter what Brenda will try and leave me as broke as possible Just giving money away Stealing whatever money she can She puts on a good show but she is evil as evil could be Shes payed off so many people in town at this point that nobody will be on my side or beleive me Another thing that happened is when I lived with Dawn they contacted my Nana and have been receiving money as well with my family thinking it is me There was one night she called me upstairs in her old house and it was Brenda her husband my 2 brothers and his wife They showed me this bank statement that showed I had millions from shares and other accounts One of them then said yep thats why were doing this and Brenda said were taking it from you then everything went completely black But now in that house the new owners because they actually didnt sell it they are just hiding money They built a wall right where this happened Stupid spot weird dont know why they would do that But something tells me they filmed the entire thing of my reaction and now to cover it up that it wasnt me in the video they got the people that did the renevations to build a wall right where this all happened She has dont everything she can to either kill me or send me to prison She has even gone as far as paying women to say that I raped them Dont even have to touch them they just say I raped them and she has to go into a trust account and pay them off It always has to be a situation where it would scare me into thinking nobody would beleive me and I would go to jail Shes an evil bitch This old friend of mine Dawn and Kaylee are no different I know they contacted my family pretending to be me and collecting cheques from my family Collecting birthday cheques or whatever From what I gather what happened is someone in my family found out and contacted them they just offered them some of the money and payed them off Easy as that And instead of giving me the cheques personally just went around to places I go to and said here give these to Devan like they actually fucking would Im not getting any fucking answers from anyone because everyone has had a turn ripping me off and nobody wants to take responsibility They have fucked with my head to bad at this point that its all a game to them This could all be a fucking little game just to fuck with my head Because what they need is for me to be crazy Especially if its one of the how many people have a fake illegal power of attorney over me So as long as they make me go crazy it then gives them in their sick fucking heads the ability to access my funds or assets and do whatever the hell they want with it These people abuse power of attorney to its fullest And if they are my power of attorney wheres my rent being payed wheres my utilities being payed where my allowance wheres any of it Its my funds and thats one of the responsibilitys of power of attorney Brenda was the first one that I know of to do up a power of attorney one night when I was drunk Which automatically makes it void completely null Any legal agreement or contact signed while one of the individuals is intoxicated or under the influence by law it makes it completely void right from the beginning Making any money they justified spending illegal as fuck But once that power of attorney was made I noticed she was really tryihng to drive me crazy Just doing shit to annoy the piss out of me I also suspect she was feeding me mercury and getting people to put in my dope There was a bunch of flourescent lightbulbs broken in the garage but the entire house or garage does not take these bulbs anywhere When asked about them I was told oh i think mason found those and was playing around with them The white powder that is found inside of those bulbs is mercury Its in powder for but it is mercury You can easily add that into someones food drugs drink whatever Making them mentally unstable unstable enough that making a financial decision themselves would be considered no in their best intrest Thats where power of attorney comes into play Now whoever has that power of attorney can make financial desicions for that person as long as its in their best intrest In this case I think paying people to embarass me or to beat me up is not in my best intrest what so ever I think me being homeless and other people getting trailers bought for them or whatever other toys jeeps whatever How can that work Isnt power of attorney suppose to make sure all taht is taken care of for that person None of this has been in my best intrest or to benefit me They want me to sell their own shit back to them Or any shit back to them So it dosent feel like they themselves are losing",,,

author: Unable-Tree6262
text body: Let s get annoyed together Hi I m just here to rant about my family I know not everyone is perfect blah blah blah but there are just some things that annoy me so freaking much Buckle up buttercup Get ur glasses and some snacks bc good god this is long Oh and trigger warning if ur homophobic or whatever For context I m Filipino my parents and their siblings came to America and procreated like many other immigrants The reason being a better life as that s usually the reason So that makes me second generation Let s say half of my family went on to go get blue collared jobs while the other half just couldn t let go of their old ways remember that When I say old ways I mean like working hours on a farm growing plants selling them and forcing their own kids to work with them And before you say child labor or whatever earning money is hard and heck why not teach your kids the family trade and how you make money for the family This was one good thing that helped shaped some of us it made us humble and learned to appreciate things more yk I say some bc there were the few spoiled brats I don t blame them at all farming is good honest hard work And it s nothing to be ashamed for but it s not for everyone Here we go Note These are in no particular order or ranked a certain way Problem 1 CONTROL Farming As I ve mentioned farming is how some of my family lived and worked to get by Love or hate it but never look down on it Now what s the problem You ask It s the fact that for me personally my family created a business out of it That s good right Yes it is However it s the fact that my parents tried to really PUSH me and my siblings into joining the family business When I say push I mean force us to work and operate things To them it s easier to hire family bc they can easily control us Heck my older sister had to major in business in college so they could shackle her to doing the taxes invoices emails online work for the business While my mom handled paper work and work logs and me and my other sister did loading unloading cargo packs the products quality control physical labor And it s not like animals or eggs NO it s plants produce grows in the soil big ass plants grows in acres of land shit I used to like our family farm but grew to dislike it bc of all that work AND pressure from my parents When my sisters got jobs their farm work lessened but when I tried to get a job I was told no Yes my parents told me no Why Because they decided that my only opinions were our family farm or other relatives farms Like WTF I DONT WANT TO WORK ON ANY DAMN FARM I was 16 when I asked that bc I wanted money Not under the table money not mommy or daddies money my own money made from my sweat and tears at a job of MY choice Like I get it I guess Not everyone wants to work on a farm and finding workers is harder but that doesn t mean you can keep me here So where s my dad in all of this well news flash he s the boss He calls the shots takes the calls makes the connections He has the final say besides my mom in what goes and stays And remember how I said they like to control us if anyone of us did something wrong or messed up even by a little we would get it BOOM An earful a whole ass scolding lecture whatever you name it AND bc we re family objects came into play His hand could be a weapon those standing fans the tv a hanger slipper etc We re their own kids but sometimes it was hard for them to see that Love Tough love Where Puhh lease Spare me the details on the wild goose chase for love Problem 2 SEXISM Like most Filipino families or just families in general who have to deal with power dynamics or perhaps sexism suffocating gender roles etc Mine clearly just can t get rid of it Welcome to my experiences as a young woman I ll mainly be talking about my mothers side of the family for this part My mothers family those who have immigrated to the u s at least consists of my grandparents and their kids my mom her siblings of 7 Those 7 are 3 girls and 4 boys Out of 7 only 6 ended up creating families of their own with the 7th youngest spending his days trying to woo a woman Each family had either 2 5 kids with the average being 5 And most of those kids ended up being girls That s where I come in Being a girl in itself is always a challenge BUT being a girl in a semi sexist family well it definitely ain t any easier All the girls in the family end up being smart or at least make smarter decisions pretty respectful fierce with a little bit of trauma When I mean trauma oh boy it varies As for all the boys in the family I suppose they re not so smart a lil stupid nice and hella stubborn except for some the younger ones they re sweethearts Now you re probably wondering how odd my descriptions are but I can assure it comes with a good reason Discipline Yes what starts this whole shift in treatment is how we were all disciplined Here s an example of how things usually go Say we have a brother and sister they ask they re parents if they can go out and hang out with some friends Simple right No Ofc it s isn t SIMPLE or FAIR The parents say that the brother can go heck they quickly dismiss him to leave already And the sister The mom is already on her ass about a secret boyfriend getting pregnant staying out too late doing bad things the whole sha bang And the dad He stays firm raises his voice to say she is not allowed to go As all this is happening the boy is out and about being reckless in someone else s car probly drinking getting hurt Do you see it yet The huge ass gap right there between what a girl vs boy can do And heck even if the brother comes back in the morning hung over they brush him off as being a boy Still don t see it Okay here s another It s a big party maybe a debut for a just turned 18 daughter celebrating her womanhood like a Quinceanera or a sweet 16 Everyone is having fun laughing enjoying the food and DRINKS Drinks huh The girl that has just turned 18 is hanging out with all the adult cousins and they bring out some shots Can she drink Ding ding ding That right SHE CANT Her parents give her a look that could kill But look at that the younger boy cousins who aren t even 18 or 21 and they re drinking beer A shot of alcohol vs bottle of beer Do you feel angry yet Do you feel annoyed that these boys aren t being disciplined the same way as the girls It s because these parents don t stop the boys from doing stupid shit that they think it s okay Heck if the girl breathes even a little gets too fat isn t lady like isn t home by 10 isn t this or that she s probly already grounded And thus I introduce depression Yay now she has depression from the inequality oh why aren t you celebrating My aren t the parents happy that they ve restricted they re daughter SO MUCH to the point of depression so she doesn t get hurt All the parents think about right now is providing for the family they have everything to give their kids a good life So why is they re beloved daughter not so happy Oh well they ll probly ground her for being an ungrateful child Hey remember she s 18 she can finally leave that wretched place Far far away but oh no That s a big no no from her parents And thus they ve guilt tripped her into staying Gosh That was a looooot huh Do you need one more Okay just one My OWN experience When I was younger maybe 5 or so I would hang out at my cousins house after school I d stay there until my parents got off work to pick me up At my cousins house we d play all sorts of games animals cards house best coconut leaf whistle potion making etc Everyone was chill girls together and boys together But at some point my boy cousins let s call them ER EM took the initiative in making MY life miserable Yes me Idk why and I haven t asked them till this day bc they ve changed for the better Every day after school ER EM would bully me till I cried They insulted me took my things trashed my bag heck stole my snack push me Yk usual bully things It got so bad to the point 5 year old me wanted to walk home in the middle of the road Yes I wanted to All I ever did was be nice to them bc I was told that I should treat others how I wanted to be treated At school they re angels but at home Devils I ended up not going to their house anymore and being picked up and dropped off SEPARATELY Our parents have talked it out and they ve been scolded repeatedly but nothing got through their hard heads But only their sweet father did the scolding I felt bad for him their mother Oh for the love of god SHE FUCKING BABIED THEIR ASSES No wonder the scolding didn t get through their heads ALL THAT BREATHE WASTED ON TRYING TO STOP UR HORRIBLE CHILDREN FROM KILLING YOUR NIECE AND YOU BABY THEM She felt so fucking bad for her sons more than her niece that wanted to Heck even Niki s mom saw what I was trying to do at the time and stopped me Of course I wasn t alone one of my closest cousins had a heart RIAN My sister even tried to get them back but boys being boys laughed it off That shit didn t stop until middle school but by that time the damage was done My once happy go lucky child self died to become more reserved and insecure While I got bullied they got babied Equal exchange right According to their mom it definitely was Ngl I m still salty about them throwing away my hard earned Pokémon cards Take it all in baby we re still not done Problem 3 GRANDCHILDREN WHEN Associating women with children It s been a combo since the beginning of time or whatever I ll still be talking about my mothers side of the family Let s be real here I ain t gonna get mushy over kids or babies I don t have baby fever and quite frankly neither do most of my cousins I m a girl if you havent figured it out yet lol I never saw the appeal when I was younger maybe only bc I was playing house to pass time I m older now not a child anymore so the aunties and uncles are asking if I have a bf or gf I ll come back to this or any kind of relationship That s the usual as relatives do get all up in your business They don t actually care some of them and are just nosy ANYWAYS I may not be at the age of serious baby talks but you know who is That s right fellow reader my sisters I ve mentioned that they both have jobs but they also have boyfriends of their own Good for them Oh no here comes my FATHER Yes my father I wonder what he wants When are you having kids HUHHH I get that they re old enough but like kids In this economy tho That s all parents ask their kids for when they get old And my father of all people who literally demanded to have grandchildren a man asking for a woman to go through all that fucking pain for some kids I get it he s getting old and my pet cat won t suffice as his grandchild my cat is my child lol So his next best options are my older sisters in hopes that they ll make some babies And yes they will but for by their own choice to Good lord That should be enough right RIGHT Nah You thought wrong Back to me My parents ask if I m planning to have kids HELL NO I ve already said I hate dislike kids If I did have ANY at all MAYBE one The chances of that happening tho are very very very VERY slim I don t want to buss my own body up to birth a child I like being single and free it s hard enough to take care of myself But a kid my own offspring who will probly suffer from the same mental illness given to me by my parents As if I d rather date a women and not have any kids my blood or not Yes a women Oh and slight warning I like both men and women Yes both Here s where the next problem comes in Problem 4 STUCK TO THE OLDWAYS MINDSET Piggybacking off of the last problem of my sexuality I am bisexual Meaning I like both men and women Why is that a problem you ask again for the 100th time probly Well not everyone accepts that They don t agree with same gender couples having a love life And that s okay we all don t see things the same and we don t need to Just respect or ignore em We re harmless However the thought of my parents precious daughter living her life with no kids let alone with a WOMAN is barbaric and wrong There is nothing wrong I m being dramatic for the explanation My family or mainly the women who have come straight from the Philippines have a certain mindset that has been hardwired into them the moment they ve been born Or rather those who have grown up with the idea of glorifying being married to a man be a good wife having a family showing off your kids or something Then take those ladies and put them into America but fast forward to when being gay is normal HALT It s not normal to these women And it will never be because they re stuck to their oldways or the Bible A man women couple is the only thing they consider valid or acceptable And for me I had to find out the hard way of their TRUE opinions of gay lesbian couples Like most people who ve struggle to come out to their friends or families I have come to the conclusion to NEVER come out Why My parents or mainly my mother does not accept same sex couples marriages For things to make a little more sense let s take a trip down memory lane A few years ago around the time my younger cousin let s call her CC started to date boys Every relationship was shit and toxic Until that is when she started to experiment with girls Maybe kiss one or two idk But one day CC brought me and my older cousin let s call her Niki to talk in private And in confidence CC shared that she was Lesbian we both accepted her and treated her normal Time skip a little to when CC is in a serious relationship with her gf RY Now she is ready to finally come out FULLY To her parents and her family The beans are spilled Everyone knows now but still have mixed opinions the girls are chill we still love her The boys don t give a flying fuck THE ADULTS That s were drama starts All the aunties have a 2 cents they want to give and the uncles are chill they acknowledge CC RY So where are CC s parents HELLA disappointed in their oldest daughter turning gay What s worse They treat her with EVEN more restrictions and rules because she came out Heck they openly dislike everything They talk shit about their own daughter to relatives my mother being one of them But is this affecting any of them No It s her life not theirs SO WHAT SO HARD to understand Back to the present I m with my mom in the car on our way to Niki s house I tell my mother that I ll be going to hang out with some friends on the weekend She asks who I say blue hair she says are you sure she s not your gf But with the most concerned look of dread Hint1 I respond is saying she s just a friend and it s only lunch My mother sighs in relief She better not be your gf Hint2 HUHH Okay now I m curious Before we get out of the car I ask we this Hey mom what do you think of CC being lesbian I wait in anticipation my gut is clenched as I stare at my mom waiting for her response CC is JUST CONFUSED she ll realize that she is wrong And will be with a man Those words sucker punched any thought of coming out at all At least not to my family And it killed any respect I had for my mother that night My mother spoke so stern and annoyed My gut dropped my eyes fighting the urge to not look angry or disappointed All I can muster is an oh and get out of the car I bolted to go tell Niki what I had just heard I hated no I loathed my mothers response so much I promised to never tell CC what I heard that night bc she likes my mom Ik I m protecting a hater but she s still my mom I knew my mother talked to CC s dad because that s her brother And I thought they would just listen to each other s problems So why didn t I think that maybe she s grown to dislike same sex couples even more So many thoughts races though my head that night yet there wasn t one that would consider the hate and disgust I d gotten from my mothers response There s more instances of my homophobic family but that s for another time My head hurts now Thank you for reading this far Here s a gold star I know there s worse as in my family and others but for now I ll end this one here But if you ve made it this far I have some questions for y all Feel free to answer any what are your thoughts on all of this did you relate did you feel anything what is your position in YOUR family Ex parent middle child grandparents idk I m just curious what are y all views on such matters And how it s been handled or would ve been handled in your family",16,Female,daughter

text body: So earlier today me F23 and my parents mainly my dad got into an argument about how they were so strict with me when I was growing up to the point where I depend on them for a lot of stuff nowadays which is bad for my age compared to how they treat my sister now who s 19 I was telling them how it s not fair that they let her do whatever she wants and barely ground her or discipline her whenever she acts up but if I were to do the same thing when I was her age I would be on house arrest grounded or have my phone taken away They said they re trying not to make the same mistakes that they did with raising me but I feel like they want her to succeed by giving her this freedom while I m still struggling to be independent due to them not teaching me certain life skills making me stay at home and focus on schoolwork and Covid quarantine The worst part is that my parents couldn t even apologize for creating these problems for me or whenever I ask my dad for help with something he gets mad bc he s the type to get upset about everything So basically what I m asking is AITA for crashing out on my parents well mainly my dad about my frustrations on being treated differently as a first born eldest daughter And how do I get over these feelings and deal with my dad since he doesn t wanna really take accountability or change his toxic behavior Let me know if you want more details on what happened bc there s a lot of stuff that happened in this argument but it s too much to type out for this post",23,Female,daughter

author: Ordinary_Boats
text body: Hello I hope you re doing well Here s the situation I m 25 F I m writing to you because I ve been through a lot in the past few months and I need to talk about it On January 21st my maternal grandfather passed away from cardiac arrest at 68 years old It was my first time experiencing grief and I took it very badly Then on March 20th my maternal grandmother passed away as well from a stroke at 70 years old It was another huge shock Then on April 19th a week after my birthday my paternal grandmother passed away Her death was more expected because she had been suffering from Alzheimer s for over ten years and had been in a nursing home for eight years She hadn t recognized us for a long time but she was the grandmother I was closest to and losing her really shook me What made it even harder was that we had to wait ten days before the funeral because of the crematorium and church availability Those ten days felt so long and painful On top of all that there were big problems with my father s family They criticized my sister and me insulted us for no valid reason For example they reject my sister 31 F because she s a lawyer saying that lawyers defend criminals and that it s not a respectable profession As for me I m studying to become a legal assistant and that s not acceptable to them either because I m still in the law From what I ve heard it s actually my cousin 29 F who s causing problems It s extremely hard to deal with grief while also having family members who don t respect you For example we had all chosen songs for my grandmother s funeral but the two songs my sister and I had picked were removed from the ceremony On top of all this my parents argue all the time They haven t loved each other for a long time and should have divorced already My father M 56 blames my mother F 61 for not being there for him during his grief but he himself wasn t there for my mother s losses earlier this year and in March They constantly criticize and fight unable to support each other During those ten days my father s family who had come from Lyon and were causing problems stayed the whole time My father insisted we see them because for him that side of the family came before the four of us my sister my mother him and me It was such a tough ordeal and everyone suffered But today I also found out something else I looked at my father s phone because I had a bad feeling and I discovered that he s cheating on my mother This isn t the first time when I was 15 he was already contacting escorts I told my mother back then He swore they were just messages that he never went any further but I didn t believe him because I had already caught him before without saying anything When I exposed him it caused huge fights and my mother never trusted him again He still holds it against me today for telling the truth blaming me for looking at his phone and for talking about it as if it were my fault Recently while we were staying at our vacation home to try and recover from everything I saw messages where he invited someone to come over with winking emojis and very suggestive messages He had renamed the contact St Yriex which is the city she lives in and deleted their conversations My sister also found out things when she went to pick up a package at Sephora they gave her a parcel my father had ordered a perfume that wasn t for my mother or for me or for my sister He took the package but we ve never seen that perfume at home and my sister is convinced he gave it to someone else She also told me that when I was younger she had once caught him sending heart emojis to another woman and had confronted him about it This behavior has been going on for a long time My sister says she doesn t know what to do On one hand if I tell she thinks my mother will stay anyway that nothing will change and that I ll just get yelled at again She says it s their responsibility not ours But on the other hand I m struggling with the fact that my mother keeps calling him affectionate names pretending in front of others while at home they re always fighting and saying they hate each other I still live with them while I finish my studies because I can t afford to move out so it s really hard to distance myself from all this My mother doesn t know anything It s also important to know that my mother is visually impaired so she can t see she can t know who my father is talking to I feel like my father is kind of taking advantage of her disability So should I add this revelation to everything we re already going through with all the grief Are we ready for that I really don t know I just needed an outside opinion from someone who doesn t know my father my mother my sister or me It s really weighing on me to act like nothing s happening Thank you for taking the time to read this Wishing you a very good day or evening Sorry if my English is not good it s not my first language TL DR Should I tell my mom that my father is cheating on her when will already experienced 3 griefs this year in less than 4 months",25,Female,daughter

text body: Im so tired of my mum I love her but it gets tiring at a point It annoys me to see how none of my friends mums complain to them about their fucking money Everything about my mum is about money i dont even know anything about her It s like we live in 2 different worlds I never see her and if i do she always says hurtful things about me Whenever we go out like grocery shopping or furniture shopping at the end of the trip she always compalins Look how im spending more money on you why am i always spending so much on you Thats what a mother should be doing providing and not compaling to their teen daughter about money Everytime she compalins she always says it like a joke but it gets tiring In the car one time she complained about how all of her paycheck goes to her kids me and my siblings theres 4 of us She complains about how she never spends the money on herself and always on me and my siblings infront of me I felt embarrassed for her as an asian family we like to show off tell and show people that we have money but shes always yelling at us even in public complaining how she has no money and its all our fault She also always complains about how i show no affection to her shes always comparing me to her workers They always say i love you at the end of a call but i never do When i was younger i loved my mum i loved her so much id handmake my own cards everything was about my mum I made her bracelets and little gifts that were meaningful to me But soon i realized she d just toss them aside and laugh She never showed affection to me So i gave up When i was ten i completely gave up It was useless I never said i love you i never gave her anything I just locked myself in my room I avoided my family throughout until now Ive had enough My mum complains about how im never sweet and how im always cold to her And when i tell her i had been sweet but she never loved me back she just laughed and said dont lie why werent you like your little sister I was so close to breaking down I don t know what to do anymore She s the type to laugh when you do something sentimental and look at you like you re crazy I don t feel like I can say anything to her without feeling guilt or uncomfortable I feel so guilty",,,daughter

text body: Life back home was tough but we were managing Me my husband and our little boy decided to take a leap of faith we left behind everything we knew and loved to move to California hoping to build a better future My mom s cousin and her kids had been encouraging me to come for a while Some backstory I used to spend my summers here during high school and a bit after graduation I never got along with their daughter Mia we constantly butted heads Her siblings always took her side and I was often teased for being rich because my mom was with a man who supported us generously What they didn t know or didn t want to acknowledge was that I had also lived in a tin house with my dad s sister I knew what it was like to grow up with very little I remember living with my grandmother crammed into a one room extension with nearly 10 people But when I tried to talk about that part of my life they laughed They called me a liar Still I believed things had changed I thought time had matured us all When we got here Mia insisted she be considered one of my son s godmothers I said sure why not I ended up staying with her sister Layla instead of Mia or their parents because Layla offered her place saying she d be working a lot and I wouldn t be in anyone s way That seemed like the best arrangement At first everything seemed okay But there was always tension like I was walking on eggshells One day my husband and I got into an argument He needed space and went to hang out with George Mia s brother That s when Mia called me I told her we had a disagreement and she said Oh you re always being dramatic Kellie I didn t want to deal with that energy so I hung up She showed up at Layla s house uninvited and started scolding me You re so dramatic You want your son to be a child of divorce like you This is what you re teaching him I tried to calmly explain that she didn t know the whole story I was never a runaway I just moved between family when I needed a break and I liked spending time with my grandma and aunt But she kept going accusing me of being selfish and a bad mom I told her I ll literally go to a shelter I m not doing this with anyone right now Then she said it again You re selfish You need to be a better mother You re a bad mother That s when I snapped I hit her Layla stepped in Things got heated but eventually settled Then radio silence from everyone for days I said I d leave but they insisted I stay On Easter Sunday I was with Uncle Tim and Auntie Lisa when they got a call from Mia s parents they wanted a family discussion Uncle Tim asked me what happened I told them the truth and they sided with me They said Mia has always been a bully and deserved to be called out I understand what I did was wrong but I also know my mental health has been in a fragile state I always try to be upfront about my boundaries but they keep getting crossed When I tried to apologize to Auntie Janice she said I know my daughter s a bully but what you did still isn t excusable I agree that what happened wasn t right but where s the accountability for Mia Two weeks later Layla decided to kick me out She moved our mattress to their parents house Mia called me to apologize but not without a few final jabs first She claimed she had nothing to do with how things escalated I told her how she made me feel We set boundaries and that was that Since moving in with Mia s parents things have only gotten worse I ve been constantly nitpicked and scolded for every little thing especially chores Meanwhile Uncle Tim s son who also stays here does nothing He leaves dishes everywhere and I get blamed They even started calling family back home saying I neglect my son because I m always on my phone Here s the irony Their daughter once told her mom she was molested by her uncle and her mom called her a liar Mia once called her brother a rapist and a cheater and when that audio came out the family was more concerned about who recorded it than whether it was true They ve witnessed their eldest daughter abusing her kids one child has a bald spot from pulling his own hair and he can t even read because she pulled him out of school Yet I m the one labeled the problem They act like the perfect family but no family is perfect What hurts is that they felt the need to involve more family now my cousin back home is being warned not to come here because I ll make it bad for her too Thankfully she stood up for me and said they weren t telling the whole story This has all spiraled into something I never imagined I thought we were starting a new chapter but now I just want to leave I need to focus on getting out and starting over again For my son For my peace One of my older cousins back in Guam recently reached out She said something that really stuck with me that she thinks I ve always just been an easy target It s easy to point fingers at you she told me Everyone still sees you as that troubled kid But I was never troubled I was just a kid trying to understand where I belonged in a broken home I moved around a lot not because I was running away or being difficult but because I was searching for safety for peace for something that felt like home What she said helped me realize something I hadn t seen clearly before the family didn t really know me They projected their own pain and judgments onto me Instead of trying to understand my story they made me the scapegoat They chose to believe the worst about me and once that label stuck it didn t matter how much I grew or changed It s heartbreaking to feel like no matter how far you come some people will always see you as the version of yourself that fit their narrative And in this family that narrative has become a cycle a pattern of denial projection and silence This is a continuation to a couple of my last posts I ve decided now that I need to get out of here as soon as possible once I m out i will not be in contact with any of them I know the consequences and downsides with staying with people from other experiences I know it s never easy but this all just sucks",,,mother

author: LP-MERCHANT
text body: People live together and not always in a good way Some people might demand to hash things out or try to turn the conversation into we were both upset These unofficial models of conversation can hurt people and make painful connections The longer things are left the worse the feelings can become If a conversation is a disagreement there does not need to be one person victorious over the other Invite to good reasoning and ethics rather than belittling the other person Advise away from not good reasoning or cruelty rather than demonising the other person It might be that there are two people upset at one another for different matters but mistreatment is not the same as a dislike When a person mistreats another it is better that they seek forgiveness and make effort to treat the other better and avoid their past mistake Forgiveness and reconciliation are good and they both are needed to maintain good connections If a person tried to equate a mistreatment to a dislike then they would be enforcing a distortion on another person That would add mistreatment to mistreatment and would be even further from reconciliation People mature through knowledge and experience Each conversation can improve all people involved People can enrich each others lives with beneficial knowledge and effort",,,

text body: TL DR I am seeking objective if possible advice on controlling my DH s issue with playing caretaker assistant butler ATM for his family and of course roping me and our finances into it Background My husband and I both come from families that were are impoverished Our parents made sure to imbue us with all the parentification they could and in that way our childhoods were exactly alike The Rest if you like to read My Family My parents raised me in the worst part of the worst city evictions utility shut offs and empty fridges par the cour Finances were never stable birthdays after age five were never guaranteed and if I ever went anywhere or did anything it was because it was a state sponsored program My father was an immigrant he stocked shelves at a local store and did odd jobs to get by even while his eyesight was being eaten away by a progressive disease He was one of those guys who found self worth in womanizing and was quite successful at it seeing that my mom was 26 years younger than him The type of guy who aims to be the life of the party and only plans as far as putting one foot in front of the other My mother was is simply a grown woman with daddy issues who would slowly realize that the daddy she clung to was not only a terrible dad to his firstborn children two of whom were older than her but also an unsupportive narcissistic spouse My mother tried to leave at times especially when my dad schooled her too often but she would ritually get roped back into their toxic relationship until I turned 8 and they split for good After they split my mother kept me and my dad moved into another woman s home until he found a small studio This move marked the last time my father ever financially assisted my mother with my upkeep and the beginning of my mother s cyclical struggle with homelessness misandry and paranoia Forcing me to drop out of school and follow her from temporary shelter to temporary shelter until adulthood As an adult I did what I was trained to do I got a job so that my mom could go to school while I paid the rent I was afraid to leave her side as if she wouldn t make it without me I also supported my father who at the time was in an advanced stage of eye disease and homeless I d send whatever money I had left after bills to him All while being relentlessly bullied by neighborhood goblins I never had the money to afford proper clothes for myself Once I got the opportunity to I began working on my education and never looked back I now hold a master s degree My mother is also fairly stable after living with me for close to 6 years We don t have the best relationship now but that s beside the point My dad now has government assistance after years of petitioning for his residency Long story short they can both take care of themselves and I m working to heal my parentificated inner child DH s Family My DH s family had better means while he was growing up His father was a politician his mother was a teacher and he lived what I and many others would call a privileged life Stable home food harmony many siblings help and what seemed to be a well managed wealthy family which quickly spun into chaos after the death of his mother when he was eight years old Soon after that his father s political career spun out of control and although his grandmother attempted to provide some normalcy by moving in and taking charge of the household things quickly fell apart Their government for reasons still unclear to me took possession of most of his dad s assests and their family quickly fell closer to the poverty line After eight years of petitioning to reclaim his earnings his father passed away and his grandmother not long after This left him and his cousin the leaders of the family both raised in a patriarchal society and even though all of his sisters are older he had to assume his position as the head of the family he was only 17 years old Following his father s dying wish he took a sum of over 60k abroad to use for tuition fees and living expenses Then proceeded to blow it all on women dropped out of college and beget a child Since then he s had a second child with a different woman before meeting me and finished a technical degree His family however continues to struggle with poverty even after reclaiming many of their dad s assets They seem to be extremely invested in upholding an image which was supposed to die with his father The Problem He and I have built a stable life bought a home and are recovering our finances to build an emergency fund among other things But his family keeps coming I don t know what impression he is giving them but our little wealth has been built by blood sweat and tears alone We had no help and no one to lean on during the process absolutely no one Every other week a brother or nephew or a sister comes to live with us or has a problem that requires thousands of dollars What makes it worse he will take out a loan or borrow money to appease them and tell me only after the deed is done I know he loves his family as do I but the constant leeching is driving me nuts and the financial burden always falls back on me whether he s short his half of the mortgage or not able to chip in to buy our son his second son which I adopted as my own new clothes It feels like it will never end I m writing this submission as a lifeline is there any way this will end well",,,

text body: Hi everyone I need an outside perspective on a lifetime long issue I will try to summarize everything to the best that I could remember for some of it But most of it has only come to light recently so I apologize if there s any missing details So in the past year I feel like I ve been broken down by my family dynamic Mainly with my father and a little bit with my mother For background I am 23 M yro with 3 siblings My eldest brother who ll be called John 30 my twin sister who I will call Mary and the youngest brother 17 who will be called Bob John recently got married to a great woman who I will call Nancy my father is a pastor from the southern United States Baptist camp and I ve been in church nearly my entire life I lived with my parents even in my adult years since there is no housing available in my price range I also am in the army as a part time reservist So this isn t the first time that something like this has happened even though I do not remember much Around my second grade year my mother and father had lived separately for a time and my mother lived with her mother and all of the children lived with my dad All I remember is that it was weird having Mom absence and Living with Dad was strict There was also a time in my high school senior year where my dad had exposed my mother for being unfaithful and in order to make the peace everyone had to give their locations to everybody I will not pretend that I didn t have a regular childhood since I would say that my family was pretty well off financially at least well enough to where mom and dad got new cars almost every two or three years and last year they bought a house together with the hope that when all of the children got married everyone would come to their house with their children Although I really don t remember most of my childhood if I m being honest Other than I remember being more free spirited than I am now and conditioned to be the dependable hard working child Anyways growing up was a little bit difficult mainly in school and how for the longest time I was not allowed to defend myself and that I eventually became into a people please and kind of person And I mainly attribute that to how my father raised me Such as how the summer was little time for rest since he would have us work during the summer with home improvement projects that ultimately meant nothing in the end There are times where mom and dad did stick up for me such as how they had to stick up for me while I was having a rough time getting along with my boss who was scheduling me during my military time which is illegal btw and how they were able to help me when I got into a car accident in January 2023 since they had my location Fast forward to my adult years I did slowly become more and more strained with my father Well honestly say that I m still trying to live a Christian lifestyle I ve grown to know that I mainly went to church out of obligation on accounts of my father And there were plenty of times where we had plenty of fights such as I had told my father that I would drop out of college if he tried to force Mary and I to go to the same school and he yelled at me because he said that he was joking and that it was my fault for not understanding that he was joking Our fights were never really fights it was more so a one sided conversation where it was like he was spanking me but with his words And last year we probably had one of the worst fights because I was having trouble keeping my part of the house clean After he was done yelling at me I just stood there for a second thinking of what to say but I didn t wanna say yes sir but I also knew that I couldn t say what I wanted to say so I just gave a nod After that I went to my girlfriend s house and out of spite I decided to turn off my location to keep myself as detached for my dad as possible And I had actually contemplated staying the night to get away from him But I ended up going home because I knew that I couldn t stay with my girlfriend at the time I got home late and my phone had died since it was really old phone with a broken charge port And Dad had thought that I had done something wrong and that I was ignoring his calls When I told him that my phone had died he said that he didn t believe me and I showed him my dead phone On the next day we got into another really big fight where it was following a letter that I gave Dad that basically detailed how I was not still over the traumatic experience over my mom being unfaithful and that I feel less fortunate because other people seem to be able to Live their life to the fullest whereas I have to work for everything to just barely get by and then I also made the complaint that God is seemingly absence of my suffering When he read the letter he honestly ignored my feelings and said that it was my fault because I lacked direction in my life And after that massive fight I just kind of kept to myself and decided to keep my emotions to myself and try to make nice with Dad and everything but I did Fast forward a couple of months I get a phone call from my leadership saying that I have to go to Europe for active duty And I m currently in Europe now Before then I went on a vacation with John and Nancy and for once I felt free to do whatever I wanted and say whatever I wanted so I decided to talk about my issues with mom and dad And it turned out that PJ also had issues and that s my sister also had issues and that really everybody had issues with my parents When John and Nancy decided to move in together mom and dad tried to spin the narrative that Nancy had corrupted John But when John had talked to Mom Mom had decided to see the truth for what Dad has been doing And that Dad has actually been more controlling Mom and how he has been controlling some of the finances With this in mind I had already left home but Bob and Mom decided to leave Dad and Dad decided to panic and tried to get in touch with everybody and I was reluctant to talk to him at first but I had called him before going to Europe and I called him out on everything that he did from how he raised me to be a people pleaser and how he threatened to kick me out of the house And as it turns out he made that threat without consulting Mom first And since that I have not spoken to him and honestly I don t plan on it Months have passed since then and John and Nancy have made peace with dad but Bob has told me that Dad has not changed And at this point mom and dad are getting a divorce and that I m still not planning to talk to my dad right now Although not a day goes by where I have not thought of Regretting my decision to cut my dad off But I m sticking to it for now There were also times where John and I would talk about Dad and he would try to convince me to try to give Dad a chance but I m remaining firm and even making the claim that life is better without my dad since I ve been in Europe Although John has threatened to limit contact because at this point he is happily married and says that he does not wish to allow the negativity to get to him While I understand this he also made the claim that I haven t done anything to improve myself which I actually took offense to because during my time in Europe I ve been slowly progressing myself in my health physically and mentally And I ve also been into therapy as well so John telling me that I ve been doing nothing to make the situation better really made me angry to the point where I actually thought about not talking to him and cutting him off as well For a moment I actually thought about listening to him but when I reached out to Bob he tells me that Dad has been putting up a front and that dad has been trying to make nice with him but he thinks that it s all fake From using money in Easter egg hunts which we never did previously As well as seemingly taking an interest in some of the things that we weren t allowed to watch as children such as Harry Potter So right now I m a bit of a crossroads because I m going home in four months and in a perfect world I would love to stay in Europe but unfortunately it s not that simple I still want to try to have a relationship with my father but I m trying to decide whether or not a relationship with him is even possible Lest I risk ruining my mental health again and I m back to where I started And the worst thing about Dad is that as many fights and arguments since we ve had the one thing that he did is lie about Jesus He lied about the gospel and tried to make it more about legalism and adult children being subservient to their parents He used Jesus s name to push his own narrative and agenda And because of that I m still recovering from dad s wounds and I m having a hard time going back to church I want to continue to love Jesus and serve him but I m having a struggle because of having to purge dad s false teachings My mother and I are on good terms But at the same time I also can t help I feel detached from the rest of my family since I have been living the best life in Europe and I ve been able to be my own person capable of making my own decisions Which is ultimately what I ve wanted since all of this has come to light I m not really sure what to do from here but I could use some advice or if nothing else some encouragement I also want to know if I am truly wrong for not talking to my dad still and that I should give him a chance",23,Male,sibling

text body: serious trigger warning i talk about suicide a lot in this sorry but it s the reality i guess throwaway account because while i don t believe anyone i know actively uses reddit i would really prefer this didn t get back to me in any way so i 19F have struggled with mental illness my entire adolescence i m autistic but was only recently diagnosed so i m still figuring out which behaviours of mine current and from childhood are linked to that and what aren t what i do know is that as a result of my autism and my fathers passing when i was little struggled with severe anxiety my entire life social and otherwise this was detrimental to my ability to make friends growing up and when i did i fell into a pretty toxic group of kids relevant i promise which led to me self harming among other things i was in therapy for a year or two after this was discovered by my mom 40F but that was stopped after an altercation with mine and my brothers joint therapist who completely disregarded my moms insistence for us to do bereavement counselling to work through our fathers death i started going to counselling again after my mum got sick a disorder like schizophrenia was the diagnosis this service is provided to those under eighteen so i think it s important to say i m currently not receiving any mental health support my mom developed it a few years ago i was sixteen and it was pretty much like our world imploded as our mom was our only non estranged family my brother and i 14 at the time of this went to live with our uncle pretty much against our wishes i love my uncle but mental health is a vicious thing in our family and despite having lost two family members to suicide it s not treated how it should be anyway my mom was hospitalised and for a while she got better this year she got sick again it s been five months and she is in a consistent episode she hates my guts thinks my brother isn t real etc over the time my mom was in hospital my room got gradually messier and messier i admit its disgusting now not uninhabitable but it needs to be cleaned theres clothes everywhere definitely some food packages laying about and none of my belongings are organised it should not have got this way but with everything i was dealing with family wise on top on my own mental health and having serious depressive episodes and multiple relapses it just became the lowest priority when my mom got back out she became increasingly hostile towards me its important to say she was not and is not currently taking medication because my moms mental health team is beyond useless the days leading up to the event that blew up my life my mom made several comments about me looking like my dad i know in my soul this is what broke the camels back she kicked me out on her birthday her reasoning my room again my mom is sick like hallucinating kind of sick while i am the first person to say that my room is a problem i need to deal with it is not cause to kick me out other nor is that reasonable like i cant clean it if i m not allowed inside my family don t really seem to gaf like i know that they care but i ve pretty much been left out to dry here i m staying with my uncle which is fine but with me included it s a family of five in a two bedroom flat with two cats one of which is extremely sick i know my family love me and i love them they just suck at supporting each other majority of my family live out of state so this is literally the only place i have to go bar my boyfriends house which is not an option for more than one or two nights a week i ve tried to ask for support and it kind of feels like i get brushed off every single time they first suggested rather demandingly that i just clean the room that i m an adult and i shouldn t make excuses when i tried to explain to them my own struggles with depression at that time now we talk about it more but it either comes down to you just have to clean your room or it ll sort itself out which it wont my mom needs medication she has a disorder she is sick if she had cancer nobody would be telling her that she doesnt need chemotherapy but because my mom has a psychological disorder its okay that she refuses to take the pills that could stop her from potentially hurting herself as of this month my mom and i are no contact she s hurled so much abuse at me stuff about my likeness dad that i just cannot deal with he wasn t a great guy etc and i have nobody but my boyfriend to talk to about it i m grateful for him obviously he s literally the reason i m able to deal with this but i wish my family were more understanding we ve lost two people in our family to suicide including our dad and i ve dealt with stuff like that my entire life but because i m not dead it isn t serious enough i want to say that my mom is not at fault for this psychosis isn t something that can be managed without medication and my mom is simply dealing with the fallout of a life long battle with trauma she didn t even really know she had what i m angry about is the fact i have no support i literally spent every single day doing everything i could to help her and yet i m immediately in the wrong in my families eyes the people who literally will not even text her ive dealt with multiple relapses a near suicide attempt multiple physical health scares all while going through my first year of uni this has set me back so far behind in my schooling that i m terrified i wont make it back next year on top of the fact i have nowhere to actually live i have a part time job but cant financially support myself enough to live alone especially not with no outside support student accommodation isn t an option for this summer either so the only options i have are for my mom to miraculously get better or to wait until September to get into accommodation and it s still not over my moms been out of hospital for over two months now and is still insanely sick my brother has called ambulances multiple times now i ve had to leave work to help him deal with it but they wont take her back to hospital because every time she refuses to speak to them she s made several comments about suicide which terrifies myself and my brother having already lost our dad to suicide i m also financially supporting my brother for the most part because sometimes my mom will refuse to pay bills because they re being punished or because they re not playing along i know i m an adult now and that some of this stuff was definitely avoidable but hindsight is 20 20 and at the end of the day i m just a girl who misses her mom i can t talk to these people i can t cry around them i am being gaslit into believing that this is life and life is hard but this could all be stopped if someone would talk to my mom at least make an attempt to get through to her try and contact her mental health team etc this is not life this is what they ve decided my life should be and it sucks hard on top of that i missed a lot of uni days helping my mom or taking mental health days so i didn t crash out in the middle of a lecture i get off handed comments about my intelligence and my attendance all the time i tried to comfort my cousin because she did bad in a test but did better than the rest of her class and her sister snapped at me and said i wouldn t take advice from you about schooling i literally passed all of my exams one of the highest in my grade WHILE my mom was sick and i literally thought she was dead cause she went mia for days WHILE having serious autistic burn out and being unable to get out of bed most days because i was so severely depressed i am the first person in my family to go to university i study english literature and creative writing and my dream is to be a writer 99 of my absences are accounted for because my tutor is a normal person with empathy like am i crazy seriously am i crazy because i m considering going no contact with all of them as soon as i

text body: Hey guys I recently had somewhat of a revelation that I d like your input on For some background I m a 27M who was raised by a single mother after a bitter separation from my dad There was abuse and cheating from my dad s part and he was overall kind of scummy dealt drugs and beat my mom Despite this my mom had me and my older brother with him and they were together until I turned 3 So this is where some resentment towards my mom comes in Being a single mother meant she had to work a ton to support herself and us and there was never anytime to spend with us which sucked considering our dad was out of the picture jail So when she decided to remarry and have another kid when I was like 6 7 it felt like a slap in the face because it felt like I was being pushed to the side for this new family she wanted even though she barely had time to give us any attention It always confused me as to why she would do this and then complain constantly about never having time to do anything despite it being her decision to start another family and it created this really strange high stress environment at home that made life absolutely fucking miserable Like clockwork stepdad ended up cheating tbh I don t blame him my mom is kind of a frigid tense high stress work hard type A person who has no chill and I don t know anyone who would tolerate her a few years into the marriage she got divorced again and AGAIN decided to remarry and have another kid within less than a year of meeting someone else a few years later I was entering high school at this point I remember telling her don t you think you re moving a little too fast She said we re grown we know what we re doing She was around 40 at this point Well it was more of the same shit Constant fights and arguments High stress fraught marriage She admitted to me that she regrets getting married to him this really fucked me up and made me just hate my life and feel worthless Of course I never really understood my emotions then or how to articulate them Despite this I was a really high achieving kid in school and went off to college on scholarship but ended up dropping out after having anxiety and panic attacks which ended consuming a greater part of my 20 s which stemmed from me thinking I completely fucked up my life I m better now but upon reflection I think a lot of my anxiety came from thinking I had to follow the path Go to school get a good job to support a family find a wife get married have kids and when I couldn t have that I felt like a huge failure but I ve recently begun to think I had it all backwards and my mom was the perfect example I think her preoccupation with saving face in front of the family our family is very traditional divorce not allowed is a sin no abortion sex before without marriage frowned upon and not just being happy by herself has caused her a great deal of pain that she could have avoided if she wasn t constantly chasing this perfect family I always wished she would chill the fuck out but I now think that she was more concerned with what her family would think than what was best for us And now when I realized that I had those same preoccupations I realized I could just chill the fuck out and let them go and live my life on my own terms and not what my family thinks of me and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders But I think will I regret this What if I don t pursue building a life with someone else as aggressively now while I m still young Will I end up regretting it later when I m old Maybe my mom thought this also What do you guys think",27,Male,son

Will show him any comments when I meet up with him All names changed Some places changed I don t need advice but feel free to comment The end of this story was 2 years ago so I feel comfortable posting it now My name is Michael I was born and grew up in the Midwestern United States in the suburbs of a small town I barely remember my parents I know my mother was from Europe and married my father after meeting him on a holiday trip The gist is that one day they were there and the next day they were gone Both snuffed out in a traffic accident when I was 10 years old I was then taken in by my uncle Mark my father s brother who lived nearby It could have been the best thing that happened to me in a bad situation But unfortunately I had to mess it up From the very first time I stepped into their home I had apparently made it my mission to make them miserable I am not going to make any excuses or offer half assed explanations Maybe I was just hurt from the loss of my own parents maybe I was just a little shit to begin with Who knows Doesn t matter I basically became the poster child of what it means to be an ungrateful brat with massive entitlement issues My uncle Mark his wife Mary and my cousin James who was 3 years older than me did everything they could to help me I lacked for nothing and thanked them by being a constant thorn in their sides I am not going to go into detail I was a bully I stole stuff and many other things My cousin James became the main target of my ire and understandably started to resent me I wish he had been more outspoken about it I would have deserved a good scolding But every time anyone tried to discipline me I simply pulled out the good old my parents passed in a traffic accident card Worked every time even though it shouldn t It all came to a close when he announced his engagement to his girlfriend Sarah I should have been happy for him Instead I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to annoy him one last time and pull out all the stops My plan was as childish as it was cruel I spread a rumor about him having been unfaithful making use of social media for my accusations to spread It caused a massive rift in their relationship and their marriage was almost cancelled Almost The last straw came during the wedding I was displeased that my original plan had not worked out and decided that I was owed compensation The cash gifts from the wedding guests were the perfect target I pocketed all of it and left the wedding Having turned 18 recently and suddenly being in possession of close to 20k turned out to be as bad a combination as you would expect I burned through it within about 10 days while ghosting everyone as not to be disturbed while enjoying my ill gotten gains I then came back home and finally got what I deserved Disappearing from the wedding and the cash gifts going missing with me made it quite easy for everyone to figure out what happened I wasn t exactly the criminal mastermind I thought I was I wasn t in fact quite ignorant During my time away James had gone full detective mode He not only had obtained proof that I had taken the money but also managed to trace back the rumors I spread about him to the social media accounts created by me He and the rest of the family confronted me upon my return and finally put their collective feet down James insisted on pressing charges I was arrested interviewed and put in jail No one in my family posted bail and honestly why would they What happened afterwards is what you would expect Criminal charges civil litigation and more I was given a court appointed lawyer who was surprisingly nice to me despite me still having an attitude After 6 months my attorney had come to an understanding with James and his lawyer I would promise to apologize to him in writing admitting everything I had done and pay back the full amount I took plus his legal expenses and all court fees In exchange I would be spared jail I accepted without hesitation already starting to realize that I had hit rock bottom After being released I moved into the spare room of the only friend I had left Carl had always been on good terms with me probably because he felt a kinship due to having lost his own parents at a young age He never enabled me never put me down never took any shit from me He was just there I was able to get a job in a warehouse with some aid from the court which would give me the possibility to start paying back what I owed It was around this time that I finally became aware of my own behavior The time I spent in jail and the legal process had already made a significant dent in my ego The time I spent working and repaying James did the rest A bit less than half a year before my 21st birthday I had made the last payment to James I was rather proud of myself mainly because I had managed to pay my dues in record time by living like beggar Carl had been a great support and even congratulated in a snarky way by commenting how proud I must be to have gotten back to zero I then decided that I could finally look to the future Both professionally and socially Both avenues would remain closed On the social side I tried to genuinely reconnect with my Mark Mary and James as well as other family members taking full responsibility for my actions I wrote emails sent messages and even wrote letters It went nowhere All three of them rebuffed my attempts blocking me wherever possible and eventually threatening me with a restraining order In a final desperate attempt to show them that I was serious I offered to leave them alone forever if they agreed to one last meeting They agreed We met in uncle Mark s home I originally suggested a neutral place but they obviously wanted the home advantage James wife was there as well but didn t speak for the entire time I started off by admitting to all my wrongdoings explaining how I wanted to make amends and offering to submit to any conditions they had I didn t make excuses didn t deflect and didn t deny that my choices were to blame for anything It didn t matter They took turns laying into me which I took without flinching knowing that I had it coming James unofficially concluded the meeting by explaining that he had decided to enforce his boundaries and preserve his peace which necessitated him to cut all contact with me for his own well being I couldn t help but admire him for it though it sounded rehearsed and more what you would hear from a trained therapist or self help book I knew it was the right thing to do and he didn t owe me jack Uncle Mark nodded in agreement and asked me to leave reiterating that they weren t my family anymore and never wanted to have anything to do with me I had no choice but to accept I stood up and stated that their decision was understandable and that they wouldn t hear from me again Then I apparently made a final mistake Before leaving I said I wished them well and hoped they would have a happy life For some reason this infuriated James to this day I have no idea why it was that in particular He charged at me and hit me in the face shouting that I should finally shut up and just get lost Uncle Mark pulled him off and while he was restraining James I made my exit I made it a couple of feet away from their house before I heard a voice call my name Uncle Mark had opened the door again and stared at me Don t ever come back Do you understand I started stammering something but he just repeated the final question louder and more furiously Do you understand I was finally able to stammer a faint Yes Uncle Mark then closed the door and I kept walking Professionally it turned out just as bad Small towns are exactly what you would expect them to be Close knit and interconnected Everyone is tied to everyone else Be it through family ties business contracts church groups and similar The warehouse job I had gotten was unbeknownst to me the only job I could have gotten to begin with It was run by an old recluse who didn t care about anyone and anything perfectly inoculated from what the rest of the town said did or thought Unsurprisingly it was impossible to find any other employment of make significant moves No matter where I applied the answer was always an immediate rejection The closest I came was the office of an accountant at the very outskirts who was actually willing to employ me even offering to train me I was exhilarated already imagining a future where I could make a living as an accountant myself I was also dumb enough to mention it in one of my rare interactions with people when grocery shopping James wasted no time after learning about it and contacted the accountant s office raging about how employing me would backfire on them The guy running the office told me how James had unloaded everything he thought and threatened to badmouth them everywhere if I was given the job The offer of employment was rescinded shortly after I still couldn t get mad at anyone I understood why they did it but it didn t change the fact that it left me with no choice but stay in a dead end job forever and live out my days as a hermit It was at this point that I decided to pull the plug I had one last card up my sleeve and decided it was time to use it My mother bless her heart had never given up her foreign citizenship And when I was born she had the good sense to go to a consulate and register my birth This automatically gave me her citizenship as well since the country she was from operated under law of the blood I was told this by my attorney during the aforementioned legal proceedings after he decided to go through every shred of documentation there was about me I took some days off and made my way to the nearest consulate applying for a new passport It arrived after 2 weeks Nobody knew about this Not uncle Mark not James nobody I didn t even tell Carl And this wasn t the only good news My foreign passport listed me with my mother s family name I think this was some sort of clerical error but I didn t complain essentially giving me something close to a completely new identity The country my mother was from was now my way out I had nothing left here My own choices had made sure I had no options no future and no life Furthermore the country of my mother offered an interesting way for me to integrate and take my first steps at no cost I had read up on the country All male citizens are required to do mandatory military service during which one is provided with insurance food and shelter while getting paid a regular salary It was a perfect way out All I would have to do is get there report for recruitment as any other citizen living in the country and would get a new start I stayed with the warehouse job until I had saved up around 6000 which was enough to buy a plane ticket and survive for some time When I was ready I quit my job at the warehouse sold all my remaining belongings and shut down all my social media accounts I destroyed any and all documents I could get my hands on unless I needed to take them with me The proceeds from selling my stuff went to Carl He tried to refuse stating that I had paid for rent and groceries while staying there But I insisted In the end he accepted and we went out for dinner together one last time I pondered whether I should tell him where I was going but decided against it Carl didn t ask and I took that as silent acknowledgement that we wouldn t see each other again I took a bus to the nearest available airport and bought the cheapest one way ticket I could find to my mother s homeland One day later I stepped off the plane in Western Europe In a new country with no past and a clean slate where nobody knew anything about me The next couple of months were an administrative nightmare but nothing I couldn t handle I was focused on building a new life and a new me This time with the right attitude After getting settled with the help of some social service providers I reported to the military I had started to learn the local language which came surprisingly easy to me I assume I had retained some of it from my mom imagining how she might have spoken it to me when I was little but it wasn t enough to get one of the more coveted jobs in the military I was drafted as a regular infantryman and shortly after reported for basic What followed was the most memorable and uplifting time I had until then I gained language proficiency made new friends and even had enough time to cram for some national exams Turns out I wasn t stupid and eventually even able to gain entrance into a university The military was surprisingly understanding of personal issues and the instructors and superiors would give leave and time to study as long as you did you job My new life took form and my former life slowly faded away My surroundings felt less and less alien until one day everything simply felt normal With my past slowly being lifted off of me I started to look back at my former self in a more objective manner I was better able to understand why uncle Mark and his family did what they obviously had to They were right to cut me out They were right to enforce their boundaries And as it turns out they weren t the only ones who profited from it Not only had they secured their own peace but had also given me the opportunity to move on without the need to look back Shortly before the end of my mandatory service I struggled with the idea of writing them and letting them know that I was all right But I eventually decided against it A clean cut had been made and if I wanted their lives to remain untainted and my new life to remain unburdened I needed to accept that this new me was separate from the old me After leaving the military I went straight into my studies aided by the money I had saved up during my service After finishing my degree at the age of 26 I found work through one of my old army buddies He had gone into government service and was looking for new employees I joined his office as a regular worker and managed to climb my way up to project supervisor in a bit more than 2 years The salaries here are much higher than in the US and the benefits are great At the age of 30 I was well established and had good savings I decided to cut the final tangible cord at this time and renounced my US citizenship I did it mainly for emotional reasons but it turned out to make my financials a lot easier to manage as well The first two decades of my life felt like the memories of a different person at this point My past had become history history had become a myth And that myth was now well hidden behind the fog of time I was finally living Going out having fun exploring my hobbies True satisfaction had finally set in And that s when the universe decided to throw me one final curveball As mentioned I had shut down all accounts that had anything to do with my past life and name Facebook Twitter email etc All gone And after gaining a foothold in my new country I decided to stay off There were no pictures of me anywhere No accounts What little I had was under my new name boiling down to a work email and two private emails I was still slightly on edge and wanted to make sure that no one could ever connect me to the person I once was The one exception was one of my first and since then rarely used email accounts which I simply hadn t bothered to close That account had stayed silent for over a decade not counting the occasional spam or provider notifications Until it suddenly lit up with a message It was from James We need to talk Call me All my alarm bells went off immediately I had no intention of letting my old life come back to haunt me and disturb what I had built This meant maintaining a wall of separation between me and anyone who could come after me Calling James was thus out of the question to begin with It would reveal my phone number and my current country of abode which was unacceptable Instead I wrote back stating that phone calls were absolutely out of the question and that he was free to write One day afterwards I received an answer and it was everything I was afraid of James and his wife had two kids One was a girl named Alice who was now 8 years old She was diagnosed with some sort of illness and was in need of a tissue donation James included a lot of medical terms I did not understand Tests had concluded that neither James nor his wife or any other relative was able to donate They now demanded that I get tested and donate if I happened to be a match I didn t even have to think about it I wrote back that I was very sorry about their situation but would be unable to help I explained that they had rightfully cut me off years ago and how I had accepted their decision as a well deserved consequence of my past behavior But now I had a different life which no longer had anything to do with them and thus had no intention of ever getting into contact in any way shape or form I ended the email by wishing them all the best Naturally this was too much to ask What followed were furious emails from James and Mark calling me every name in the book insisting that I had a moral obligation to help them They pointed out how this would be the golden opportunity for me to actually show my remorse and willingness to make up for my actions as I had originally offered during the last meeting we had at Mark s house It didn t faze me I responded by reminding them that my offer had been refused at the time I made it I reiterated that James Mark and the other family members had been well within their rights to enforce their boundaries and equally justified in deciding to get rid of someone as toxic as me I even admitted that I had been and still was supportive of their decision back then But at the same time this meant that the division between me and them had been final and irreversible All parties involved which necessarily had to include me were given a fresh start and a new beginning Accordingly by paying back what I was owed in monetary terms and walking away when commanded to do so I had been released from any remaining real or metaphysical debt Something they had implicitly agreed to even if they hadn t realized it at the time I ended by reminding Mark that he specifically told me never to come back and repeating that I considered my old life to be over and having no intention of poisoning my new reality by reconnecting with anyone or anything from back then I again expressed my regret over their situation and kindly asked them to leave me alone Again they seemed to completely miss the point For the next week my old email account was flooded This time not only by James and Mark Mary and even James wife were chiming in with occasional emails from others I didn t know where to place All messages were alternating between anger guilt tripping and outright commands for me to comply I ignored them all but didn t shut the account down just yet though I should have done after responding to the first email Their outbursts might have worked on the old me But that wasn t the person they were writing to Instead I started to block people one by one after sending each of them a final message saying I will not be spoken to in this tone of voice Eventually only James and Mark were left with me honestly thinking we could simply part as equals with no hard feelings Unfortunately they had different plans I reached my limit when they started demanding that I tell them where I live to hand over a phone number so they can call me and insisting on a face to face meeting I am not going to lie This scared the hell out of me If they were this unreasonable and insistent with one email account at their disposal there was no way to tell what they would do if they were given more avenues to get to me My current social and professional circle my whole life was completely separated from my past And I knew I had to make sure it stayed that way I sent out a final email to Mark and James simultaneously I reiterated that I had no intention of violating the boundaries they themselves had set up Not just for them but for all our sakes I again expressed my sorrow about their situation and wished them all the best for the future ending in another plea to leave me alone and pursue other avenues to remedy their problem I then deleted the email account After that I decided to make sure that I was safe I started to monitor their online activities Luckily their profiles were all public which made it easier to get ahead of anything they might come up with I was relieved when it became clear that no actions on my part would be necessary They had started to post about how they needed to find me how it was a matter of survibal tagging everyone they could think of Anything would apparently be helpful to them They wanted information on where I worked where I lived who my friends were They posted old photos of me asking for them to be circulated But the nature of their posts and the way they tagged people and organizations showed that they were operating under extremely misguided assumptions They were obviously under the impression that I was still close by Really close by As in the same county or state They hadn t the slightest idea that we were separated by an ocean That I wasn t even a citizen of the US anymore Or that I had a completely new family name Their profiles furthermore contained links to a donation site asking for money to keep up with expenses during Alice s treatment They also asked for people to get tested voluntarily hoping to find a donor match It was good to see that at least some of their efforts were going towards a productive use of social media instead of incessantly focusing on me A look at the donation site showed that it was going well and I even decided to make a somewhat significant contribution myself Though I made it through a colleague under the pretense that I didn t know how to use the site paying him back through a bank transfer I kept watching for 2 months just to make sure I didn t miss anything I know this shouldn t be something to laugh at but sometimes I had to chuckle Nutjobs were commenting on how they had seen me in various places in my old home town the state and even other places in the US Some offering to follow me if they came across me again these people are seriously deranged They once zoned in on a homeless shelter in a neighboring town where some poor guy had apparently somewhat similar features to me Based on what I could dig up online they actually drove there made a fuss and scared the living daylights out of the dude by pressuring him to prove that he wasn t me Police got involved and they only backed off after it became clear that they had harassed some random sap The comments sometimes got quite sinister Allegedly retired police officers gave tips on how to lure me out by reporting me missing filing random criminal charges against me and similar shenanigans There were even shady looking private investigators offering to find me for the right price It was a relief to see that their best ideas wouldn t have a snowball s chance in hell of even getting close to me I did feel sorry Alice but reminded myself that it wasn t within my power to do anything That might have fallen within the responsibility of the person I once was But that person had ceased to exist a long time ago And honestly that is a good thing After being satisfied that I was safe I closed down the account I had used to monitor them as well which felt like putting an end to this unwelcome visit from the past once and for all The only possible loose end was that I had renounced my US citizenship in the country I lived in now meaning that the US consulate technically knew my new name and citizenship I know I was probably being paranoid but I called the US consulate nevertheless and asked some questions that wouldn t raise suspicion After the call I knew that this avenue of investigation would be a dead end as well assuming they even got that far Everything was thus in order Over half a year has passed since then and I am at peace I don t know what happened to James or Alice and I doubt I ever will There is no need for a stranger to know about the lives of other strangers I have my job I have my friends I have my life And most of all I have my own boundaries which I will not allow to be breached As strange as it sounds I will always be grateful to uncle Mark and his family for setting those borders up when I didn t even knew I needed them myself They ensured not only their own peace but also secured my own future in the process By forcing me to face my own shortcomings without their enabling they set me on a new path A path I didn t mess up like the last one Mark Mary and especially James certainly didn t deserve what I did to them They were thus right to make me pay for my transgressions They were justified in cutting ties It is fully understandable that they doubted my sincerity to make up for my mistakes and finally change I would have doubted myself back then as well Anyone would have Instead they were kind enough to demand a very small price Full separation I paid it and did so gladly Which is why I can now move forward without the need to look back I am now 32 years old My birthday was a couple of weeks ago I celebrated with my girlfriend Nina I met her at work She is 28 a data entry specialist and into sci fi as much as I am friends from the office old army buddies and other people I met during my time here People who only know the me I am now I rented out a rooftop venue which was quickly filled with laughter music and conversation During the evening my former CO came over and complimented me on something strange Said he remembered how bad my local language was when he met me during basic But now he wouldn t be able to tell me from a native speaker For some weird reason that stuck with me It was as if I had managed to overcome some final hurdle that completed a journey I wasn t even aware I was on After the celebrations had ended me and my girlfriend got ready to return to our apartment I stared back at the venue before walking into the staircase prompting Nina to ask me whether I had forgotten something I answered honestly Nope Nothing important If anyone reads this Just know that it is never too late to change Never too late to start something new I wish you all the best",32,Male,Nephew

author: breaditusers
text body: I ve been dealing with a long standing family conflict and at this point I m afraid it might be a lost cause I F late 20s have an older brother early 30s who has always been problematic Growing up he mastered the art of instigating people and as he got older he pursued psychology and neuroscience At one point he was even a PhD candidate but he never graduated I believe his major issues escalated in 2020 when he threatened a woman on Twitter She exposed him to his school professors and colleagues and others came forward with allegations of verbal and physical threats destruction of property assault and even stalking It s unclear if he s been in school since then though he s repeatedly told me and my dad that he has constantly moving the goalpost on his supposed graduation date for the past five years A few months after the Twitter incident he lost his apartment and moved back in with our dad 60 at our childhood home Within weeks he started having frightening arguments with our dad blaming him for his failures making threats and damaging property breaking doors punching walls throwing things Sometimes in the middle of these blowups he d call me despite me living five hours away by car and find a way to blame me for whatever had set him off that day Then three months in things escalated My brother texted my dad threatening to kill him Right after he called me to apologize for what he was about to do I immediately hung up and called my dad who seemed unfazed until my brother started kicking down his door That s when I called the police They removed him from the house and warned that if he returned he d be charged with trespassing That s when the guilt trips began He d text us saying he was staying at a homeless shelter and had witnessed something horrific He d bring up our mom who passed from cancer in 2007 saying she d be rolling in her grave over how we treated him He dug into my past throwing painful memories in my face even telling me to end my own life that the people I love would be better off without me Thank God I had already done the work on myself because if I d heard that 10 years ago I don t know if I would have made it About a month later my dad caved and let him move back in And so the cycle repeated Over the past four years he has continued his destructive behavior He has verbally attacked my boyfriend who I plan to marry with racist remarks He twists anything personal I ve ever shared with him into a weapon On top of all this my brother hasn t worked in years He s fully able bodied but has been unable to hold down a job and is living on welfare Yet instead of using that as an opportunity to get his life together he continues to be a toxic force in our home What makes this even more ironic is that my brother has always been an advocate for mental health and is highly educated in addiction He frequently talks about the dangers of substance abuse yet he has recreationally used marijuana for years and has dabbled in mushrooms and other substances In May 2024 my boyfriend of 4 years and I visited my dad for his 60th birthday My brother gave us the silent treatment but otherwise we had a great trip When I visited again in November things seemed better My brother and I actually had a decent conversation until out of nowhere he casually offered me hard drugs I brushed it off and went to bed The next day things took a dark turn While getting ready for a friend s birthday dinner I gave my dad a few marijuana edibles to try they re legal where we are That s when my brother flipped He accused me of trying to kill our father I tried to reason with him but he began berating me screaming that I was a f ing woke tranny piece of shit For the record I m a cis woman but that s beside the point He then told me to get the f out of his house At that moment I no longer felt safe I decided to grab my things go to dinner and find somewhere else to stay for the night As I was leaving he grabbed my hair yanked me to the floor and we struggled I managed to get up and call the police Here s the kicker while I was giving my statement the officers felt the need to tell me how well educated my brother is As if his past studies in psychology and neuroscience somehow excused his violent behavior No charges were filed because there were no witnesses and no serious bodily harm That night he sent me a barrage of vile texts I blocked him And I told myself Enough I thought cutting him off would bring relief It didn t The real issue is my dad He can t bring himself to cut my brother off I understand no parent wants to see their child on the streets but things cannot continue like this It s been six months since I last saw or spoke to my brother and unless he makes serious changes and acknowledges the harm he s caused I want nothing to do with him Recently my dad confided in me about what s been happening My brother has been stealing marijuana alcohol prescription meds anything with street value I m terrified for my dad It feels like I m watching a slow motion horror movie except it s my life",29,Female,sibling

text body: I don t know how to explain this especially when I don t think anyone else in my family knows this For background info my dad and aunt has been in a family feud with their parents whom I refer to as grandpa and grandma and this feud started way before I was born It started when my grandpa was gossiping to my grandma about my aunt but he was also gossiping about my grandma to my aunt kinda confusing ik leading to my aunt and my grandma to have this really massive fight where my grandma ended up cutting my aunt out her trust fund and inheritance burning my aunt s clothes and stuff and even threw the rest of my aunt s clothes out the window This caused my whole family to take sides with my grandma and grandpa on one side and my aunt and dad on the other side From my dad and aunt s interpretation my grandpa was the mastermind behind it and used my grandma as a shield to make him seem like the victim as my grandpa claimed that he didn t do anything wrong after this incident and my grandma as an enabler My grandpa and grandma wasn t really good parents to my dad and aunt My grandpa was an absent father who constantly cheats on my grandma and conducts affairs by claiming that he has business meetings My grandma was pretty abusive towards my dad and aunt often beating them up for tiny mistakes basically they would walk around eggshells every time she get back home from school I am actually quite surprised on how my dad and aunt turned out being relatively normal people with great achievements in life and starting their own family My grandpa was also apparently a big fat bitch towards my mom during the early years of my mom and dad s marriage When my parents first got married my grandma was nice to her and welcomed her to the family Meanwhile my grandpa viewed my mom as not suitable as a wife to his precious only son This was because my dad s side of the family is filled with wealthy and scholarly people they re the typical doctor lawyer businessman engineer career and expectations Which is why they made my dad go to the best school in the city sent him abroad to study graduated from a top private university and got a high paid corporate job My mom was the complete opposite from that she went to art school and didn t graduate from university as well as coming from a low middle class family from a small city However my mom is actually more impressive than what my grandpa thought she migrated to Canada at 19 and learnt english while also being a model that represented her hometown and worked at a desk job Anyways my mom said how my grandpa mistreated her very badly often picking at her style the way she cleans the way she puts makeup how her cooking isn t up to par and thought she was the stereotypical dumb pretty woman that is using my dad s money He nitpicked her whenever he could and made her eat food scraps food that she cooked for him btw My grandpa would create lies about my mom about how she is talking behind my dad s back which leads to my mom and dad frequently arguing That was until my dad found out it was my grandpa who created those lies and stopped listening to my grandpa My grandpa only became nice to my mom after I was born because I was their first grandchild When I was young I didn t understood why my aunt and dad would often get into conflicts with my grandparents And I often viewed my aunt and dad as petty children until I turned 10 when my dad told me and my sister about the feud I tried to be nice to my grandparents as I don t want to be seen as a disrespectful and ungrateful grandchild But once I got older I found it very difficult to maintain a conversation with my grandpa He creates lies and lies about other people and his own family mocking their success in life while talking about his ironically failing business Not to mention he s somehow racist and sexist too I dated a south east guy in the past and when he broke up with me my grandpa told me how he didn t deserve me not because he did me dirty but because he was South east asian and they re poor and dirty and proceeded to tell me how our race is the superior amongst all asians When I got into university he told me how I am a female so I don t have to work and study as hard If that made total sense A few weeks ago my grandpa suddenly shoved my sister and I a bunch of money and told us to not tell our housemaid Which I was highly confused when I asked why he replied You ll know once you re older but I kept asking and insisting he tells me now He gave in and told me claiming that our housemaid is trying to steal our money and she was going to meet up with him on monday to get money from him since she asked him for money He told asked me to keep it a secret as he cares about our family of course I tried to believe him at first but I wanted to make sure myself So on monday I stayed home from school and kept a close eye on the housemaid In the end the housemaid stayed with me and inside the house the entire day never once meeting up with my grandpa Once again I caught my grandpa creating stupid lies I am actually pissed off and tired of my grandpa s bs He created so much lies about everyone in the family as well as dragging innocent people However I m going to college soon and it s across the globe so I won t be seeing my grandpa as much these next 4 years My grandpa keeps on calling me and asking if I could come visit him and I declined every time and claim that I am busy studying for my exams It starts next week btw I just don t want to see him after that stunt he pulled and expected me to believe it I don t know what to do I don t know if I should confront him about this or tell my parents",,,grandchild

text body: First time ever asking for advice Some context I grew up with unstable housing parents who abused each other and constant fighting My siblings and I were there for each other during those tough times I the oldest moved out first and started my adult life outside my hometown and state Both siblings stayed and still live with one of our parents Fast forward to now I have a great marriage a home and a career all 45 minutes outside my hometown I talk to my family regularly but most of the conversations end with them complaining about their situation needing money and so on I always listen and share advice which they say is great but they never follow it So I m just repeating myself I never give monetary support which makes them angry and they try to make me feel guilty Almost 10 years ago I moved closer to my hometown where they all still live and tried to set up holidays hangouts and other events with them But they ve always canceled last minute claiming to be sick not having money gas or anything else I always feel like I m trying to mend this gap but I never receive anything in return If I don t reach out drive to them or call I never hear or see them When there are problems I always get the same responses I m never here to support or I don t understand I ve grown up and realized how toxic our situation was growing up but neither my siblings nor our parents want to admit or hear it Always having the victim mentality I had a breaking point when the parent that both siblings live with has been having health issues and isn t taking care of themselves My siblings have asked for help and advice on what to do and I ve given them both I ve done everything I could but it s thrown in my face that I m not doing enough Mind you both siblings are in and out of jobs always go to the bar or have some issues with the law I m at the point where I don t even feel like I m family anymore to them I just feel like a distant friend they call to when they need something I feel awful at the thought of going no contact but I don t know what else to do I ve done everything I could I ve never once lost my temper or said anything I d regret to them I just honestly don t know what to do",,,sibling

text body: In short my brother was emotionally abusive my whole life and I was never able to set a firm boundary until I had my baby He declined to respect the boundaries set around my child so I cut contact One of our parents never misses an opportunity to bring him up in conversation and for the nearly two years I ve held strong in no contact it has not affected me However recently I have been told about how he has been mistreated by our other parent It is probably our trauma bond pulling me but I am now really struggling with feelings of missing him and wanting to reach out to him My partner who is very pragmatic would never support this and is very good at holding strong It would take A LOT for them to ever consider allowing my brother to be in our lives again I really feel stuck and lonely and sorry for my brother as we have a shared understanding of this parent who has recently done him wrong again He has never made any attempt to apologise or repair our relationship though I don t know what to do I m really sad about this sudden feeling of missing him",,,sibling

text body: TW s lf harm emotional ab se Okay so first some background information about my 20 F relationship with my mom My dad d ed of c ncer when I was 9 I loved him a lot and that affected me deeply After dad d ed my mom didn t really care about me and things started to go bad From the age of 11 she kept talking trash about my dad and how I m exactly like him and am ruining her life even though I was just a kid How I looked like him and how I m going to suffer like him all alone Constantly telling me she wishes she had an ab rti n Then from time to time she would go crazy over small things like me falling asleep one day when I was too tired to do the dishes after school and pretend to k ll herself or run away because of me Which I couldn t process as a kid so I used to constantly cry at home wanting to run away I started to walk every night for hours to get away from her and tire myself out so I could fall asleep without crying She barely gave money for food or cooked much and spent my college fund from my relatives The constant insults that I m a burden that nobody will ever like me that I ll d e alone and I m h ll to put up with and other stuff messed me up as a kid and I believed her for a long time She constantly gaslit and manipulated me and I believed I was insane I used to be so scared to go home every day in case she lost her sh t that day Whenever I fell sick she used to scream at me for being so useless and leave me alone to deal with myself I stopped telling her I was sick One day I got my period too early and didn t have pads I used to have horrible cramps to the point where I used to throw up continuously I asked her if she could buy some for me from a nearby store She threw a tantrum and made me walk to the shop bl ding into my pants I used to have a packed bag in case I needed to run away Whenever she did something nice for me she used it to manipulate me into doing something for her She used to constantly threaten me saying that she would call everyone I know and spread lies about me so they would never talk to me again But in front of everyone she acted like the best mom ever and people used to tell me how jealous they were about my relationship with my mom To everyone I was the top scorer with the perfect mom A while later when I was 15 she started to talk for hours late at night with men then one day I found d k pics on her phone from my dad s married best friend Later I asked her about it and she gaslit me saying that this was what friends did to support each other Then she broke up with him saying that it was because of me which made him mad at me I was scared something would happen Then in high school suddenly things were calm I thought the worst was over One day I came out to her as a l sbi n because she seemed understanding of the community That shattered everything for good Every day she yelled at me about how I m a monster that ab ses girls and I don t deserve to live That I m d d to her And what sin did she do to get a child like me I was already struggling to accept myself and this pushed me deep into self hatred I believed I was a monster As punishment she used to lock me in a room for days without any contact with the outside world Every day she constantly reminded me of how much I don t deserve to live and I believed that I spent months convincing her it was just a phase it wasn t but I had to survive and she somewhat believed me because she wanted to Then things changed She started joining matrimony sites and started talking to guys to get married She used to not give food or money for food and leave me in the house for days at a time while she stayed with her boyfriend then suddenly got married within a few months without telling me She used to have huge fights over him being an alc holic then blame me for everything Because in her words she got married after she lost her daughter and had nobody She took out all her anger on me every time and reinforced that I made her life hell After a few months she shifted us to his house which was 2 hours from my college And I had to share a small room with his son P 25 Travelling for 4 hours every day exhausted me and gave me more health issues They didn t allow me to shift nearer to college Staying with my step brother was a bad experience Whenever I asked her for food money she said that she couldn t give me anything because she needed money in her account But she isn t earning either so she never has money to pay for my necessities I ended up either skipping food to save money or taking from my college fund because I had no other choice My college fees are being paid for by my dad s parents as they know my mom can t pay it So I m only depending on her for food and other stuff in my daily life Whenever I tell my mom and my stepdad that I need them to pay for stuff as I couldn t they said it was never their responsibility to Meanwhile P gets everything paid for by his dad Even my stepdad tells my mom not to pay for anything for me because apparently I can manage by myself with my savings But that s my savings for the future because I know they won t help me with anything The savings were accumulated by saving all the birthday money my grandparents gave me My parents aren t allowing me to move out either because then they can t control me I can t afford it without their help either Now to my relationship with my step brother He was nice to me in the beginning But then the next thing he did was out me to my family That blew up everything with my mom once again He then lied about it to me and I wasn t sure if my mom was lying or he was Now I know the truth This was one of the million lies he told to me and everyone else He also kept talking about stuff like him being an alpha male how step sibling romance is okay asking in detail about s x talking about his d fighting and talking loudly with his girlfriend at night so I couldn t sleep then his girlfriend spamming and calling me when he ignores her for days riding his bike with me rashly on purpose whenever he is upset eating my food dirtying the bathroom and lying constantly amongst other stuff My mom also kept telling me about how horrible it was that P lost his mom at a young age like I had lost my dad Then I found out that P s parents divorced when P was 21 I was 9 when I watched my dad d e I don t think that s the same thing There was one incident that made things much worse Mother s Day We don t really celebrate it My mom lost her sh t when we didn t get her anything for Mother s Day P didn t even remember it and doesn t even do anything for his girlfriend s birthday so it was expected Also P doesn t like my mom and hates how she married his dad He constantly talks about how much he dislikes her using derogatory language But after my mom yelled at me in the evening P told us that he was taking my mom for a drive in his dad s car He told me it was only a ride as he didn t have money which was true They didn t come back for hours At around 11 p m my mom came home elated She kept gushing about P Apparently he took her to the mall and bought her a 4K dress He held her hand throughout everything and paid for it Then took her to an expensive bakery and bought her a cake My mom never eats cake but did for him He had written the phrase Best mom ever on the cake He claimed that he did all that because of the pure love he had for her But he has always tried to win over my mom and come in between me and her so this was his way of making her like him more Messed up but my mom was floored After a month he explained that he didn t have any money so he didn t spend it He said that his dad had given him the money in confidentiality to spend on my mom That broke my trust with my step dad and caused issues But after a few months he admitted that he lied about it because he didn t want me to feel bad That was obviously a lie P never did anything that didn t benefit him But that only brought forth an unhealthy relationship between P and my mom He constantly insulted her behind her back but with her he pretended to be her best friend and kept spreading lies about me Then something changed and my mom stopped letting P meet or talk to his girlfriend He already treated her like trash but P was so mad My mom and P kept yelling and fighting whenever his girlfriend or biological mom was brought up My mom used to cry so often about P talking to his girlfriend and P used to keep consoling her My mom started doing more for P like cooking more promising more efforts for him and kept insisting that she did more for him than for her own biological daughter me The same issue happened with P s biological mom too My mom cried and screamed whenever P talked to his biological mom She kept throwing fits when P didn t acknowledge my mom as his mom P also fed into it and they both became eerily close She pandered to his every request while barely listening or bothering about my life Whenever P s dad or I tried to talk to her she would only talk about P and divert every conversation about how P is talking to his biological mom or his girlfriend P got some sick happiness from it and boasted about how my mom likes him more Which was sad because I had tried so much for years to make her show some affection to me but I kept getting disappointed every time and I had given up This continued for a year with her constantly having breakdowns and P and her making up She also kept complaining about P to me and wanted P out of the house after his studies Whenever I needed any help she always claimed she was too sick to do anything because of P s behavior But she was fine we checked everything with doctors She made me do her housework after college because she was sick and didn t want to disturb P If I refused she wouldn t pay me for food My stepdad always supported her and took P s side in every situation His behavior with me wasn t great and I won t go into detail as it is another topic I felt so alone in my house all the time because they were one unit only talking to each other and only bothered about me when P was involved in which case I was overreacting because I was a girl The only thing that got me through all this was my girlfriend R 22 who constantly supported me and kept me sane Then a bigger issue I managed to move out to live closer to my college They didn t bother to pay for much and I had to get the cheapest apartment alone in a shady area It turned out much worse than expected and I had to go back home after a while P s dad came to pick me up I reached home Then I heard loud screaming from my mom Apparently P s dad was drunk He drank that night because P had done something disappointing My mom threatened to k ll herself a few times and tried to jump off the balcony P s dad was too out of it to do anything and P had gone outside I had to drag my mom to the room with all my strength while she kept thrashing around I had to hold her down on the bed while she kept wailing and screaming This went on for hours It then hit me that P s dad had driven me home drunk He had put me in danger Still I couldn t worry about myself or the stuff I had dealt with in my apartment I had to be the adult and console both of them The same thing kept happening at other times And immediately after I managed to sort it out they would call P and they would laugh and spend time as a family again Then I had to travel with my step dad for his college reunion in another state My mom was supposed to go as all his classmates brought their spouses but she didn t want to travel leave P alone There he was drinking for most of the night with his friends and some of them were behaving creepily towards the girls My step dad constantly talked about how he wished he had brought his son to show him off The trip wasn t a great experience as he kept going off to drink during the day R was scared about the situation and kept me company on call throughout There are many incidents that took place which I can t explain as it would go on and on Once P crashed his bike He was completely fine but his bike engine had exploded When P is mad he tends to break stuff or drive rashly so his bike wasn t functioning as a result of it My parents got mad but fixed the bike and gave it back to him Then the next time P was upset he crashed his friend s very expensive bike He got injured and was admitted to the hospital Minor issues like a bruised shoulder and a cut on his foot My mom and his dad lost their sh t They kept crying while seeing him Despite the claims of my mom being sick she cooked so much for him late into the night and almost all day She also kept visiting him in the hospital which was about 20 km away Constantly told me to take care of P and make sure he was okay Moreover both my mom and P s dad believe that this accident has transformed P into a new man as God saved him They praise P for everything even though he brought this upon himself They paid for the damages for the bike P had crashed Now after he finishes college they are setting him up with an apartment My mom and P are at home alone most of the time and they talk constantly with her using a baby voice with him which creeps me out P has become completely awestruck by my mom and believes everything she says like how he is reborn and destined to a great life despite him not doing anything to work for it She has also assured that all his dad s assets will be passed down to him even though P s dad wanted to keep something for me as I have nothing to my name My mom apparently refused anything to be given to me and her son should get everything Whenever I told her that sharing a room with him was something I couldn t handle as I couldn t pander to his needs along with my work she lost her mind and yelled at me She also assigned all the chores to me as now she can t deal with anything I was completely exhausted and barely had any peace of mind This situation is still going on and whenever I bring up that I can t deal with things both my mom and P s dad make fun of me for being such a coward and that I will never be able to handle life Recently P s dad gave me a ride to my doctor s appointment He continued a conversation he has been having with me for a year He has been trying to get me to pick up a job similar to his in the same workplace Apparently they both want to have an eye on me always He also wants a part of my salary to be sent to them after I start working and it is my obligation to do so otherwise he will take it directly from HR Then he said that they needed a new car and needed my help to buy one later on as he can t afford it I have always refused to help out in the future as they haven t supported me in any way and only made things worse Also my profession doesn t assure a good salary despite it being really hectic Both my mom and P s dad are livid that I m so ungrateful and ready to throw them away after all that they have done for me All three of them have kept insisting that I m overreacting and I m weak so that s why I m trying to run away by moving out instead of staying like a true family In my culture it is considered a sin to cut yourself off from your family Deep down I realized I m also trying to hold on because without them I feel like I m completely alone with nobody to rely on and that terrifies me So am I overreacting",20,Female,

text body: Context I am a 3rd year international student at a top uni in Canada and I just turned 18 in January Since I have been in Canada since 2023 my father who lives in the US has never come to see me despite being less than 5 hours away He says it s because of work but obviously nobody works 365 days straight anyway he recently applied for a US visiting visa appointment only letting me know two days before the appointment Fortunately I got the 5 year visa He specifically told me not to inform my mother as he was convinced she would stop the process as she has done in the past I ll explain later So I didn t Eventually he bought a plane ticket for me to come over after my exams for two weeks Initially he didn t want me telling my mom until the day I arrived but I couldn t do that to my mom as I knew she d be distraught if so So I called her and I told her about everything and she immediately said no She explained that she would like to be in the vicinity when I visit insisting that she d be there in case I need a place to escape to as it is my first time seeing him in 10 years I argued that my father would never hurt me but she said that she had known him longer than I have I couldn t say anything back I mean she is right I don t know what happened between them before I was born I couldn t really argue Now I had to push back my trip till July and my dad did not take it well He kept saying that he waited for me to be an adult note I am barely an adult so I wouldn t be influenced by her That if I really loved him I would fight to see him And yes I did argue but I have my reasons for not disobeying my mother My mother and grandmother raised me in an African home where fathers have the say on every decision made for the child But somehow they managed to go against every decision he made bringing me to the US when I was only one when he kidnapped me at my first birthday party arguing that my half siblings would miss me the high school I attended and the same argument was used Even when it came to my choice of university they were focused on universities in Canada despite their arrangement for me to attend school in the US Though I chose my school because of its prestige and scholarship my dad is convinced that my mother influenced me to choose it During my whole childhood I only saw my dad once and only ever spoke to him on the phone without supervision when I turned 12 Other than a few gifts here and there he has never been involved in my life financially only after I got to Canada he started sending me an allowance still not asking about my tuition fees but always asking about my grades From what I understand from my mom he did something horrific to her before I was born hence her reasoning for not allowing me to leave with him Despite what happened between them she still allowed him to be present to some degree in my life However she always made it clear that she didn t like him and so I was always a little wary of him I never felt really comfortable with him as he felt like a stranger and he was only my father by name not by actions So yes I don t love him as much as he does he wasn t there enough for me to be and left all the responsibility of taking care of me on my mother and grandmother as he raised another family in the US If he wanted to he could have visited more or sent money for my care even if my mother denied help I don t put all the blame on him though my mother stopped him every chance she got for her own reasons I don t know how to tell him this as it is going to break his heart and to be honest I won t feel terrible about it I have done fine without him so building a relationship with him now doesn t benefit me much it just feels like he wants to take all the glory for being my father because I was raised well and am now on the path of becoming a doctor despite not helping at all",18,,daughter

author: PandaDrinkinBoba
text body: I just wanted to know if anyone relates to this issue especially if you are Mexican American Here s the context My family has always gone through financial harships because of my dad My dad isn t a horrible father hasn t been abused to me but if it wasn t for my mother he wouldn t know how to take care of my younger sister and I He s very financially irresponsible My mom has always been the one responsible for everything Even though my dad pays for most of the bills she still has always been working and taking care of me I respect her for it and love her I know she s a good mom and I know she loves me but she has been my abuser Not to get into too many details but she has caused a lots of mental verbal and physical absue that for many years made me have crippling self esteem issues until recently and I was diagnosed with a form of ptsd I never liked to accept that I have mental health issues even now it s hard because of the way she raised me and victim blamed me but I have them So when I was 18 turning 19 I m 21 now I moved out because after I graduated high school she wanted me to immediately go to college when we didn t have the money it was hard for me to apply for scholarships because I struggled a lot in school I barely graduated and I had no idea what I even wanted I didn t want to go back to a similar environment when I had struggles a shit ton in high school Almost every day it was fighting and her trying to gain some more control over me but it became hard because I was 18 and my dad gave his car that was under his name so she couldn t control that Now I live on the opposite side of the country where I used to live My relationship with my mom became better Somehow she even apologized through text over a funny relatable mexican meme about how she treated me It was still hard for me to be affectionate and unresolved issues with my mom but I didn t want to have any fights over the phone so we were sweet with each other But not even that long with me living independently she wanted me to move back She said it was because I d have better opportunities with college and that thr family could support each other financially if me my best friend who I moved in with my mom and dad were paying for rent At first I thought that might be a good idea because I live in a smaller city and not a prosperous city compared to a bigger city where I grew up But then she said I d have to share a room with my best friend and that I had to be applying for college while there Also my dad tends to get fired a lot and there have been times while I was gone that my mom told me that we re struggling to pay rent I was reminded of my family s financial instability My mom isn t getting as many clients at her job so she isn t earning as much money Then I heard ever since I had left my little sister had gone crazy Became the stereotypical rebellious teen but worse where the cops are constantly called It made me more hesitant Trump also got elected and my family wanted me to be with them in case anything happened They live in an extremely red state My mom was telling me word for word that if I just moved in with them their problems would be solved My younger sister who was also horrible to me would tell me that I d fix her problems and wouldn t rebel if I came back and she regrets being mean to me because she realized she didn t want me to move out even she was hoping I would I was always told by my mom that I was never the daughter she wanted I was the bad child and my sister was the good child because she excelled at school But now she realizes I wasn t the problem and says I m her favorite which I hate that she says that The guilt also weighs me down because in mexican families being there for family helping each other is important but I never felt like I was in a good family My other relatives never wanted to help us or really be there for us Now I m getting all this pressure when in reality am I really going to be helping them Will it really be better to be with them Yeah I struggle being on my own and I ve had tough times but I feel so much more free my mom was extremely controlling restrictive my whole life and now I have a really good paying job and know what I want to do as a career I could even give them some money to help them If anything really horrible happened wouldn t it be good that I m here in a not so red state My dad even said he d be willing to move here with my little sister I had told my family multiple times I m not ready to move give me a year at least to save up money but my mom would guilt trip me reassure me they would be able to financially cover for us for a bit while we look for jobs but my parents are always constantly struggling financially so how I ended up finally texting my dad to tell my mom my decision I had told my dad first because my dad is the more passive parent and we are similar in personality so he somewhat understood my decison For now I have blocked my mom and muted my dad because I have too much anxiety to deal with my mom s reaction It s to the point that when I was texting my dad I was shaking and my heart rate went up TL DR I just want to know if anyone has dealt with making the decision not to move back in with their family for their family having an unstable financial situation past abuse from family and just liking where you currently are at now that you had moved out Am I being selfish for doing this I feel there is no truly right decision but I feel better staying where I m at because I really don t think my family especially my mom and sister

text body: Hello all A few months ago my cousin crossed a line with me What started as a minor spat escalated into painful and vulgar insults In the past he would throw the occasional jabs at me that were always juvenile and I mostly would brush off But this time it was too much for me to ignore After that I decided to distance myself from him and his family The problem is they re the only family I have where I live While isolating myself from them it has made me reflect on all the past hurt he had caused This further fueled my need to step away and more or less created a disdain towards him Before this incident I visited them often But now I only go for my aunt his elderly mom to keep a sense of normal for her His little kids have noticed my absence And when they ask why I m not around as much I make excuses to ensure they aren t dragged into this Recently I spent an extended time away at another aunt s home in a different state While I had other reasons for going in the beginning the distance from my cousin was a much needed relief Before leaving I purposefully told everyone else except for him At the time it felt justified But from what I ve heard he noticed and it bothered him I came back this past weekend When I went to see everyone for the first time the tension was still there The hardest part has been my aunt s reaction While driving her to a friend s house we talked about the situation and she got emotional She told me she s never seen anything like this between us and that she hates it She teared up and said I need to fix things Apparently in our culture the younger person is expected to make amends even if they weren t the one at fault Here s the thing I don t think that s fair I wasn t the one who started this I only reacted the way I did because I was pushed too far On top of that I m dealing with severe mental health and neurological issues I ve made substantial progress in that and I m worried this conflict threatens to impede on that Distancing myself wasn t a malicious act It was about protecting myself and keeping my peace Now I m stuck My aunt expects me to apologize but I don t believe I should have to When I suggested he should be the one to make things right she shut it down immediately I frequently have felt like no has ever understood where I was coming from in my actions And this only adds to that feeling I m almost at my breaking point Part of me wants to cut ties completely to stand my ground But I worry about the fallout that can ensue with the rest of the family Being so close to my wits end I don t know what to do at this time If anyone has any outside perspective or advice to provide on how to move forward I would really appreciate it",,,cousin

text body: I 16F live with my grandma 69F who has temporary custody of me My dad 42M technically has full legal custody he was granted that when CPS took me away from my mom when I was about six years old because of her addiction and unsafe living conditions After that I lived with my dad in Colorado for about eight months but it was a very neglectful situation a whole different story After he divorced his then wife he basically forced my grandma to take me back and I haven t seen him in person since then It s been almost ten years We barely text he doesn t pay child support and even though he technically still has custody he s not meaningfully involved in my life at all My grandma has had temporary custody this entire time even though it s basically permanent now As for my mom she has struggled with drug addiction since her early teens When she was about 18 my grandparents forced her to go to rehab and she got sober from drugs for about nine years I was born during that sober period However even during those years she still drank heavily partied and relied on my grandparents to co parent me My grandparents felt bad for her because she was a single mother but she definitely took advantage of them Even before drugs my mom never acted like a real parent I was more like her emotional support system She would pull me close when she wanted affection and when it suited her but push me away when annoyed and or dump me on my grandparents She was extremely short tempered and disciplined me unnecessarily which even my grandparents admitted and lacked any maternal instinct It s always felt like she wanted someone to love her not someone she needed to care for Now my grandma keeps letting my mom come stay with us She justifies it because my mom goes to a methadone clinic twice a week For anyone who doesn t know methadone is supposed to help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms if someone is committed to recovery Patients are supposed to come in consistently to get their doses But if they miss days or continue using illegal drugs their methadone dose resets lower and they have to slowly work back up to a stable amount It s meant to stabilize recovery but only if someone actually stops using But my mom still leaves for days or weeks on drug binges resets her methadone dosage and gives our home address to dealers We ve had random people show up to our house delivering drugs and my grandma is well aware and OK with this Last week I finally convinced my grandma that the methadone clinic wasn t working We took my mom to the hospital to try and get her help with withdrawal symptoms However she had clearly just used drugs right before we brought her in The hospital told us they couldn t really help unless she was actively going through life threatening withdrawal like literally to the point of not breathing they couldn t treat her I ve seen my mom go through severe withdrawals before vomiting shaking barely able to function but unless she s literally dying in front of them they won t medically intervene The hospital did offer to get her into a detox center immediately I thought that was the best course of action because detox would stabilize her and actually make rehab a realistic next step But my mom refused She said she didn t want to go to detox only straight into rehab Despite knowing because I confirmed it with the staff that most rehabs require detox first and despite knowing there are long waiting lists for almost all rehabs my grandma decided to respect her wishes and refused to push her into detox She said my mom needs to want it herself and she won t force her I get that you can t force someone into recovery but it feels like just another excuse to keep enabling her That same night my grandma made a deal with my mom If my mom stayed at our house and didn t run off on another binge she wouldn t force her to go to detox and would only make her go straight to rehab instead My mom ran off the very next night after that hospital visit and she hasn t been back since Meanwhile when she s here I m stuck making rehab calls doctor appointments and letting her use my phone to contact dealers because she keeps losing hers Only in the past month or two has my grandma even refused to drive her around but she still keeps letting her stay and making excuses for her as well as paying for her drugs Whenever I try to set boundaries my grandma gets defensive and blames me She says if I didn t want my mom here I wouldn t help She brings up how when I was little I used to beg for my mom to stay even though for the past three years I ve told her to leave multiple times Everyone keeps telling me to give my grandma grace because it s her daughter I get that emotionally But I feel stuck I m tired of parenting both my mom and my grandma while they make excuses and I m the only one acting logically Even when my mom isn t here I m still emotionally regulating my grandma At the end of the day I m still just a teenager I turn 18 in two years and I m planning to move out as soon as I can because even my relationship with my grandma is complicated She has her own verbally abusive tendencies the same ones my mom experienced growing up I m just so emotionally exhausted I feel like no matter what I do I ll always be seen as the bad guy for trying to protect myself Thanks for letting me get this off my chest I would also really appreciate any advice if anyone has any",16,Female,granddaughter

text body: For starters I do love my family a lot and they have been very supportive of me in a lot of ways especially financially this past year However I graduate college this August and I have no intention of coming back home This past year every time I have visited home there has been some sort of chaos and dysfunction which has led me to feel very frustrated with my family They do not treat me like an adult and are always on my case about things I don t need their help with At the same time they also unload all their issues on me as soon as I get home and can t seem to take care of basic things on their own which really overwhelms me Overall I am constantly irritated when I am home and just really need at least another year of space I m graduating a year early which the original reason was to avoid additional housing costs oops My current roommate s housing plans for the following year fell through and she asked if I would be willing to live with her another year I really don t want to move back home but I know I will deeply upset my parents when I tell them I am not coming back We are a Hispanic household so it is expected for the children to live at home until they get married so the idea of spending extra money on rent will seem unnecessary to them I currently have a job that doesn t pay very well but I am actively looking for better jobs where I currently am at so I can at least be able to financially support myself A factor I am very worried about is that I got my license fairly recently and do not have a car which really limits the career opportunities I can take My family isn t doing super well financially and every time I want to bring up the fact I need a car it seems like they are always more in the hole so I might need to figure out how to buy a car on my own All that being said if anyone could take into consideration the context of my situation and give me some advice on how to gently tell my family this news I would greatly appreciate it As much as I would like to go off on them and tell them how crazy they are making me I know it would only hurt them and not support my decision even more",,,

text body: Once called Family I have a father who is super religious outgoing never drinks or smokes and is attractive to everyone but he still cheated He promised to take care of us until graduation but found a new family and passed the responsibility to his siblings and two eldest children to care for his children My mother is bright beautiful and family oriented She makes jokes to anyone until she is mentally unstable for over 18 years of her life wasted on men who cheat multiple times and a husband s mother who doesn t like her and likes his ex girlfriend She gave birth to four children with love and hope She stopped her work and her school to take care of us and yet he reasons she wasn t sexually active and always argues with him after work because she lost her trust in him ever since She lost her true self to be with him who fooled her with just the bare minimum of sending letters and flowers from an office They both regret being married at 27 years old and aren t mentally and physically prepared to start a family They were separated when two younger siblings were going to enroll in college So they made four children suffer the same fate to make us feel what they have experienced as if the promise wasn t even made She ran away from home which we thought was a vacation but after five months had passed she texted that she would never come back The first eldest child lived and graduated with the support of relatives and bears the responsibility to take care of the grandparents financial and other siblings The second child bears the responsibility of taking her two younger siblings until she finally has work and freedom from her father The third child has outstanding grades and was accepted into a big university but was rejected by her father s approval to go to a local university instead She got depressed and her image of an ideal family was broken Youngest sibling found a job with a course that is flexible to his work schedule and he can afford things he used to I was a third sibling a middle child who lived in constant emotional and psychological abuse from my own family I took the course in Nursing to be able to help people who have the same experience as my struggles I was the invisible child who had no interests like the rest of my siblings I tried to be a normal sibling but I was ignored I tried to be something good but it wasn t enough I started having normal conversations with them but I was a laughingstock So I stopped and they were bothered Whenever I was happy they were bothered I studied hard and couldn t get a part time job due to hectic schedules as a student nurse who always has multiple quizzes activities exams and patients to take care of but they couldn t comprehend what it feels like to be a Nursing Student so they were forcing me to work or shift courses I have a whole week school schedule which has 4 8 hours a day of school and the rest of the hours will be spent reviewing notes research and performance I defended myself throughout my life to the people who thought I was naive useless a burden and a worthless person who only cares about school they were the people who had the same blood as me A simple help will make them filled with anger so I have a fear of asking for help thinking they will do the same thing Many companions say I have to endure their negative actions toward me the only way to survive is to suffer from my very own source of income to get me to school But every day is a living hell to me I went home with little food a bunk bed that s too hot for me to bear away from the aircon a bathroom with a lot of cockroaches and a broken sink but I didn t waver I compare myself to my own classmates families they made them lunch boxes and have loving parents and siblings which I could never experience I started feeling suicidal to the point that I would rather kill myself than live my life with this surname that I considered as their family My father couldn t even understand what he did wrong to cheat and expect everyone to forgive him I have to listen to his constant complaints every day about why a father will take care of us and yet he is not hesitant to take care of his new family He will come home just to work and feed the pets while bringing luxurious food from a so called new family And yet my siblings did not understand my experience only took my studying as a way to make an excuse and they did not value my feelings Only I was asked for a school allowance and didn t bother with their lives They neglected my feelings so I will give them the same treatment as they did One day after graduation if I m still alive I need to go away from that city and live far away from them I will be finally free of still wanting their validation I now have trust issues depression anti social and over explaining stuff If I ever make my own family I will love my husband and my children and prioritize them the most hoping they will not experience the same that I did I wish my children would love and depend on each other I still remember the day my youngest sibling told me things so many insults and criticism Someone who told me to continue my suicide attempt Someone who cheered you up when you called me your sister when you were young Second eldest child she was my inspiration and a role model although she looked at me as a worthless and annoying sibling To my eldest brother who is sarcastic and laughs at my existence and is engaged congratulations I have met people completely different from them who ask for help isn t a burden They made me feel like I was needed and someone to talk to They helped me overcome these fears and I was able to do things I couldn t before They were the problem all this time I do hope those who have the same experience as me will be successful and achieve their dreams To all my friends my uncle and my loving significant other that I love they will always be in my heart I don t know how much I can repay you all thank you so much",,,third sibling

often copies my mannerism what i say and what I wear even down to my music taste Now you might think maybe she js has similar taste but thats not it i will do something at home like stand in a specific way and she will do the same thing when we are out and when i say new phrases i like for example i will say oh my skib as a joke and i know its popular but she doesnt know what it is and asked me and then started saying it around and i didnt have a problem with that but when I started developing my fashion taste she started buying the same things i bought often interrogating me on what i bought but when i ask her she gatekeeps and when i let her buy the same things she wears them on the same day as me and when i ask her to change she refuses i dont want to match because i want to be my own person and not oh ur her sister and often people think i copy her when i dont She even went as dar as to ask me to send her my playlist and downloas the whole thing and show it off to people saying its her own amazing music taste Its not cute or twinning because shes putting on a facade to be me and doesnt even give me credit She also tells me she hates things like makeup and nails and kpop but when i got into them and started listening to kpop and doing my nails and wearing makeup she started doing those things and for listening to kpop she was telling others i was copying her This really bothered me but i just let it go and when she saw me doing my nails and start doing nail art she hated it at first but was now obsessed with using MY items to design nails and lie to me about stealing them She hated makeup and judged me for it making me insecure for my hobby and saying i was a sephora kid even though i never wore makeup out and did it for fun but as soon as i got more comfortable wearing makeup out she started using it and saying she loves makeup She would often steal my things like my surgery scar cream and use it for herself even though she never had a scar from surgery and she wouldn t apologize she would js say oops I was often blamed for her losing things even though shed find it later id never get an apology She steals my clothes makeup skincare and everything i have It geniunley annoys me and i cant handle it She never shares or considers my feelings I will ask her for some food sometimes and she calls me a fatty even though she knows im insecure about my weight she bothered for so long that one summer i had a ed and wouldnt eat anything but dinner because my mom would force me to eat she also has situations where my mom cant pick us both up and forces me to stay afterschool alone and my sister wont pick up her phone so my mom has me go search the whole school for her Im not her servant and im sick of it but my mom tells me to quit whining My sister will stare at me and judge me and even yell out my problems to others and make fun of me There is so much more she does like one time i lost all my friends because they bullied me and she told everyone about it and said she had to babysit me because im a loser who lost her friends i got in a fight with a friend before too and she yelled it out at everyone and i was so angry and she didnt even sya sorry but was mad at me for confronting her There is a lot more but i already listed ONLY A FEW problems My mom on the other hand will always stand up for my sister as she is her favorite child My mom will tell me that I need to take care of MY OLDER sister and that i should stop acting like a baby She tells me to deal with it and she doesnt care about me Today I got in a fight with my sister because when she was eatiing dinner she didnt save any radish for me and lied saying there was only two left but before i showered i checked the fridge and there were like 12 pieces left She ate them all and while i was telling her to save some she ate the second to last one in my face I felt so angry but just sat down and ignored it My mom then came to us and was asking us what i was whining about when i didnt even whine and my sister said shes mad because i didnt save any for her and my mom was like get over it Then i went to my room and my mom called me out to get my stuff and since I was angry i didnt say anything or even look at her and got my stuff and she told me i was immature and should stop giving her attitude She yelled at me more and told me to go sleep if i was gonna be annoying I dont know what to do especially because they talk bad about me right behind me when im there and can hear them even though they know i have trauma of people talking bad about me because my old fg talked bad about me so much and bullied me to an extent i almost transferred schools When I try to be nice and talk to my sister she ignores me often and pretends i dont exist which obviously annoys me and my mom just says to stop bothering her because shes busy when shes watching reels on her phone and just tells me to let it go because im acting like a baby They never listen to me and its always my fault to them so what should i do I plan on ignoring them and stop caring for them as im tired Maybe they will see how much it will impact them after i stop

they fight over everything i remember the fight over a spoon in the dishwasher and the fight over putting too much pet food in the fish tank and the fight about wearing a different outfit i remember my sister going to the basement after and crying and me comforting her thinking if she can t be strong then i must i can t cry i must hold this family together i was 8 i remember my mom telling me at night we are only talking i remember knowing that was a lie i remember her telling me that i cannot talk about this ever i remember the first fight that was about me i remember the things they said and did they don t think i hear im too young too naive they don t know the hours i sit at the top of the stairs hearing and thinking i hear my mom wish she could leave i hear my dad say that he wanted me to be a boy i hear everything they think my ears block off i remember my sister and i slowly realizing that when they are mad at each other they get mad at us we tried to be the perfect daughters we started making jokes covering up our feelings about this i remember it being a known secret i remember the days after a big argument being cold and hard like walking on pieces of glass i remember my parents refusing to talk to each other i remember them trying to take us out or give us food i remember the week after my 10th birthday they had a big fight i remember my mom driving my sister and

take me to therapy or anything i also don t think im like traumatized enough for anything to happen i don t know i realize this is bleeding into my love life i like people who i need to chase and who don t 100 like me i hate the ones who show or talk about how much they like me i don t know what to do help",15,,

text body: Sooo I m struggling with so many things Long story short I met my ex husband as a teen We fell in love got married had some kids and then he gets with a friend and they have been married for 7 years and have kids of their own For 3 years during my separation divorce I focused solely on my kids and rebuilding my life I found God worked hard enrolled in school and finished my degree I eventually started dating I was extremely picky Every single person I looked at with a fine tooth comb I didn t wanna introduce anyone to my kids or get it wrong again I meet this guy He s perfect he wanted a family had been burned like me A mutual friend set us up He and I waited 8 months before meeting each other s kids We take things slow The sex was amazing he listened to me for hours and I did to him We never had 1 single fight We 1 year into it we have our first fight Over the past 5 years we have had little fights here and there Some huge fights where I saw a different side of him He goes into a spiral of sending me 1000 text messages Saying my behavior causes him to yell and slam doors and I do not take accountability for my behaviors and I stonewall him I get quiet when someone yells to clarify We share 5 kids together and 1 is our own It s been pretty miserable the past year We fight almost weekly we don t sleep in the same bed anymore I feel like he always bitches and complains about me or the kids I realize he s probably on the spectrum He has tics where he clears his throat and sniffles all day long He has no social skills He will walk right by people and not speak to them I hate how he behaves and awkward he is He doesn t hug the kids or talk to them much unless it s needed My issue is I do love him I m not in love anymore and honestly some days I struggle to even wanna be around him He s loyal honest works hard and pours his entire finance into me and the kids He attends every event ever kid thing he puts himself last every single time in regards to that He has a level head and thinks very logically and without emotion regarding life issues where I am way more emotional I m in a huge custody battle with my ex where we just paid 15k for a lawyer to get updated custody orders in place because my ex is a monster He operates in malicious ways He records my children asking them questions about my household he has seriously caused some serious issues where the kids are refusing to go to his house and I m trying to encourage them and remain positive and it s just a mess I m not dumb to the fact I would become a single mother of 4 divorced twice and my life would change entirely I have no family alive I will add me and my husband attend therapy twice a month and sometimes more and while it helps I still find myself annoyed at him by his lack of emotional connection I m not interested in dating or remarrying and the possibility of finding someone worth a crap in my situation is almost zero to none I just am so unhappy and idk how to turn it back on",,Female,mother

author: Hachuyani2
text body: I will do my best to explain this post to the best of my ability I am the eldest son of 4 children I am almost 34 years old my First Sister is 32 my brother is 28 and my youngest sister is 25 My parents are 61 Dad and 56 Mom My first Sister and brother are both Single brother lives with parents and first sister lives in one of my parents houses Parents have 3 houses I am living in one of them My youngest sister had a baby girl born on December 30th of 2024 Toxic Boyfriend situation who isn t always there for her but she stays with him from time to time and also in First Sister s house I am the only one who is married out of my siblings my wife is almost 34 as well we are 3 months apart and we have a boy Toddler 2yrs 6mo and NEWBORN baby boy born April 6th 2025 My wife is also from another country Philippines Now that the stage is set I ll begin with my question regarding the background I love my parents but they have an extreme boomer mindset As I said before they own 3 houses and a couple other properties my dad still works and is very well financially not rich by any means but my mom has a very bougie upper class mindset For some more background my dad was very poor growing up and my mom didn t have to worry for much but they were both abused to some degree as children My dad s side was more Mental Abuse Lack of Emotional Support and my mom s was a combination of emotional and physical her dad did things that were not appropriate to do to your daughter if you can imagine it then you get the idea It is of a sexual nature between beating and touching they have done their very best and I ve done the same to have mercy and understanding with them That being said when I was young I always had a dream of what I wanted my life to be like An example of things I had to deal with would be I had a bed wetting issue years ago and my mom would say things like you re too lazy to use the bathroom and at one point made me sleep in the garage and sent me outside in the snow in a diaper at 11 years old This particular incident she DID ask forgiveness for and I did forgive her and don t hold that against her anymore this is important to reference later because outside of that she would never apologize for anything The next example was the type of wife I wanted She tried to control every friend and even the type of woman I should be with to be specific I preferred someone of an Asian Background and culture because I love the family dynamic associated with it and decided so ever since I was 16 Both her and my dad have even accused me of having Pedo like tendencies because of this I am 6ft 4in and I used to be skinny but I grew up to about 250lbs I also had a failed LDR relationship of 4 years back and forth in the Philippines but eventually met my now wife different girl but also from the Philippines and at age 30 I did marry her 2022 and now we have two beautiful children and I got her and my first son here June 7th 2024 in the USA I also didn t mention that I was married to her until after I had already married her For even more context my brother still lives at home with them and all my siblings have jobs but I digress in order to get to where I was married I forced myself out of the house right before I turned 30 went into several thousands of dollars worth of debt trying to keep my own apartment I managed for about 15 months and would have been fine didn t talk to my parents for about a year but they called me and offered me one of their houses as a very very good deal 725 mortgage and for the sake of my family I took the deal You can shame me and that is fine I am a FedEx Driver making approximately 41 46k a year but I still struggle to take care of my family I know most people may say to just deal with the parents since they have helped me financially now with this house it s a 3bd 1ba on 2 5 acres 900sq ft but my mother literally tries to control everything I do She has disrespected my wife and whilst she does enjoy seeing my toddler I gave her a chance to see our newborn but on her first meeting she was too worried about his clothes and how they weren t the ones she bought for him The inner clothes were but the jacket was from my wife s mom and now she keeps trying to feed my newborn water which she adds to goat milk and also trying to give him apple juice She has only watched him for 5 days we would take him for 4 6 hours in the evening but she insisted on watching him even though my wife and I were managing just fine albeit very tired My youngest sister allowed them to watch her baby for 2 weeks but then removed her because they wouldn t follow her rules I know most people are going to probably see the financial side of this but I enjoy spending time with my family I only work about 25 30 hours a week I am also trying to homestead for the health of my family chickens goats etc it s a lot of work and they both shame me for it but I want the best for my family My question would be this Should I cut them off entirely and start a new life I am at a crossroads where I almost want to forsake the house and move into our own new place even if it means more financial struggle I could go into more detail about my mom as she is extremely controlling and always has been but she believes the financial help entitles her to control nearly every aspect of my life This post doesn t have anywhere near the detail but I figured I d start with this",34,Male,eldest son

text body: So I have known my sister since I was a little boy She pretty much raised me growing and ive always looked up to her She has always done great in school and has gotten her masters She is a good person My mom isnt from America so her English isnt the best but she isnt the quickest minded in arguments but she always defaults to seeing my sister out if we ve had a major altercation around her my father is no present The case is that I have really bad submechaniphobia and Ive always had it growing up Its only gotten worse to the point where I wake up in cold sweats from nightmares involving my fear So I woke up this morning with this exact problem and I rush to my living room since my phobia gets pretty bad when im alone so I seek the comfort of my mom and sister They heard me yell and asked if I was okay and I tell them that I had a nightmare involving my fear and my sister says I think you were on the titanic in a past life like that could be an actual explanation She is not joking she genuinely would count that in as a possibility Shes believes heavily in astrology so I guess that gives you an idea but anyways I dont go against her saying that even if I dont agree with that because I know I will get told that your always so negative you dont believe in anything etc So I mention that I should seek therapy for this soon since this has been affecting me my whole life and has only gotten somewhat worse with time Ive done research into how exposure therapy for phobias work and that pretty much being the only way to overcome it you have to expose yourself to it My sister says You dont need a therapist My therapist is chatGPT his name is Gibby I tell her that the AI is just going to essentially google search how to overcome phobias which ive already done before but she snarkily tells me that you don t know that and starts to ask chatGPT how to help me It pretty much lists exactly what exposure therapy is stating Start really small and slowly expose yourself to your phobia with time and try to understand it I dismiss her telling her thats exactly what exposure therapy is and that Id like an actual therapist to walk me through the process We start getting upset at eachother because of my dismissal of the AI and she decides to stop and tell me that im stubborn for not hearing her bot out all the way even when I already told her what it was going to say She gets a really pissy attitude because of that fact and for me wanting to see a real therapist On that note she has also been very stubborn growing up if you have an objecting opinion against her she will get upset and claim in my case that I m always just negative Even when something is a fact like really quick detour we saw a bug that flew up to our 18th floor apartment window she said it was a tick but ticks dont have wings and the bug clearly had a set of wings and flew away She never believed me and shrugged it off as im always trying to be right Its just so condescending but back to the original argument We just got more and more heated and I didnt want to hear her describe to me why I didnt need a therapist because of some stupid AI So we got louder and louder to the point we were pretty much yelling with our chest at eachother And I got too heated to the point where I stood up and stood right above her on the couch screaming and putting my hand around her wrist I didnt want to physically touch her but she was insistent on saying that Im being a stubborn fucking asshole and constantly trying to shut down anything I say I let go and my mom got in between us pleading that we stop she pleaded mainly for me to stop telling my sister hes like this he will never stop until you stop Which I will admit in a way was true for me but so is the same for my sister and she always wants to have the last word or be upset that you oppose her I stopped because my mom didnt want to deal with use arguing and I went to my room This is not the first time Ive had an argument this bad with my sister and only my sister I dont want to argue with her like this I care for her and my family thing is now because I got so upset for the first time I put my hands on her I seem like the bad person in this Now I am alone in my room and my mom stayed with my sister and they are laughing and hanging around I get so sad knowing that in the back of their minds even my moms I am the problem Not my sister only me and they dont need to change anything about the way they act only me slowly Ill keep getting shrugged off as the person who argues over everything even when its for things as dumb as that and it makes me feel so alone not matter how much id describe my side of anything to my mom im the problem I dont know what else to say but I wish we had some sortve of counselor to view this from the outside and examine these situations so things can change whether it be from me or sister Or both Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated if you ve read this far",,Male,brother

text body: I 32F am not afraid to cut off family members When someone starts consistently doing more harm than good in my life especially if avoidable hurtful behaviour remains unchanged after confrontation I m done Out I ain t got time for that I ve got a big family and grew up close to most of them These days I talk to none of them except my younger brother 24M and mom With aunts uncles cousins it was just the slow disconnect that I realized was a good thing when my life got more peaceful Narcissistic paternal grandmother got the boot my golden child of a father went next and my princess of a younger sister came after that A handful of years between each cut And now my baby brother is on the chopping block and I m absolutely heartbroken because it isn t going well Here s what happened yesterday My brother sent me a meme video I was actually excited We re civil and get along but only really hang out as a group with mom and my bf for board game nights Which I always thought was pretty cute and as much as I needed but YAY let s throw memes into the mix The video was nominating me to get my driver s license I have epilepsy He knows that I don t have a driver s license for a pretty damn good reason I haven t flopped for some involuntary breakdancing in a few years hooray for that but I do still have occasional focal seizures And the way they sneak up out of nowhere I simply wouldn t feel responsible or safe behind the wheel I should also mention about him knowing I have a damn good reason When I was first diagnosed my brother and mom secretly questioned my boyfriend asking the man who s held my convulsing body on several occasions whether or not I was faking it I honestly don t know why I let that incident slide It endlessly bothers me that they think so little of me That they think I would lie about that Anyways when I watched the little nomination clip I got enraged And devastated A swirl of negative emotions that definitely had me crying the more I thought about how he just straight up overlooked my entire disability and everything I fucking struggle with Yeah haha she can t drive So funny how she needs a ride to work or to get groceries or any kind of appointment So funny how she can t function independently Point and laugh I messaged some friends about it and they made me feel sane about being angry my family likes to say I m sensitive or over dramatic but adulthood slowly showed me that I m just a human with normal emotions and expressing those emotions makes my family uncomfortable It s a really fun dynamic Anyways after messaging friends I sat with my feelings for a bit to let me process a minute and get a level head Once there I wrote my response in my memos and sat on that a bit Edited once or twice I wanted it to almost be an emotionless expression of my hurt feelings My sadness or anger weren t going to be in the driver s seat this time It basically said that while I know that was supposed to be funny it hurt my feelings and I feel like my struggles were overlooked for a cheap laugh at my expense I waited 3 hours to send it Through those 3 hours I had an absolute meltdown while overthinking My precious baby brother has become quite the gymbro over the past few years and I was terrified that it d gone past the muscles and into the personality Actually I knew it already had Recently learned he doesn t fucking respect women which made me overthink more I was ranting to friends who I love for letting me talk their ears off yesterday that I was petrified of him responding you re too sensitive Sent that shit on the 3 hour mark and maybe 20 minutes later I got the reply it s not that deep I messaged back yes it is and completely fucking broke down Not only did he hurt my feelings but he didn t care Like at all I don t even care about the video anymore I care that he didn t care to apologize He hasn t sent a message back yet and it s been almost 20 hours I don t think he s going to I m contemplating messaging him again but I m not sure how to do it without making a bigger mess I just want to ask why he doesn t seem to care that he genuinely hurt my feelings yesterday It s not about how big of a deal he thinks it is He wasn t the one targeted by the joke The lack of empathy is so fucked And I feel guilty too I feel like it s my fault he ended up this way When I moved for college our communication got a lot less I should have kept it up even with everything else happening in my life I should have been a better big sister to help him make better choices and friends Because I fuckin know our family wouldn t have taught him anything fucking useful They re emotionally fucking stupid and nasty and lack empathy and tact and Jesus Christ I m just so mad at everything I don t know what to do My bf is super mad which also sucks because he and my brother are pretty close We had a brother who died just before my bf came into the picture and my bf kind of effortlessly became that big brother influence that we had lost And my bf is ready to completely drop him for my sake I love that I have a man who would do that Who actually puts me first But I hate that it s going to steal something so necessary from my brother It s going to I have no doubts after yesterday My baby brother has turned into everything he always claimed to hate I don t want to compare him to our fucking dad but God damn it Mkay now I m crying so I m gonna stop or else this is gonna become gibberish Thanks for letting me rant this morning",32,Female,sister

text body: Hi everyone I want to start my first apologizing I am processing my feelings and at times accurately expressing my feelings thoughts and ideas can be challenging and it can come across as unclear I am a 29 year old female I have a younger brother who just turned 21 We have quite an age gap and at times due to this we have not always had a common understanding we re very different people and in different stages of life I am settled in a home with my fiancé a career and quite sure of myself as a person My brother is just learning himself and beginning adulthood and getting his feet in the door and working and thinking about what he wants to do with his life I ve always been a quiet soft spoken and sensitive sister I am cautious and very thoughtful about how I address people and understand the power words have in conversation My brother on the other hand at times is not as calculated as I when in conversation with others which from my perspective comes off as brash and at times quite careless Today my immediate family came to the house my fiancé and I purchased a few months back My brother mom and other family came My brother brought his little dog this is important to the story It s our fist home and a family member who flew in from our home wanted to visit and see the home my fiancé and I were building My brother suggested we all go to a restaurant have a meal together instead of purchasing a pizza from a near by location and calling that dinner After some suggestions being tossed out we went along with what my brother suggested My fiancé was not with us he was unfortunately stuck at work and was unable to dine with us While out at the restaurant I am sitting with family and it s a self serve restaurant one I haven t been to in many years I have quite a severe anxiety disorder and get very easy overwhelmed in new environments so for me having hold of someone s arm for me is very calming and keeps me feeling emotionally regulated Holding someone s arm for me is quite important to the story If I become too overwhelmed anxiety attacks are quite common and thankfully haven t had a severe one in a few months Anyways my brother had just gotten another tattoo in the arm quite a large one in fact Again this is important to the story as well Walking around the restaurant and feeling overwhelmed at it being a new environment and things being quite unfamiliar to a certain extent Out of habit I cling to my brothers arm for the emotional support and mistakenly I lightly touch his arm he had just tattooed Publicly in the restaurant he snapped at me LOUDLY Truly I ve never been so speechless at how effortlessly and naturally it felt for him to snap at me and speak to me so disrespectfully especially in a public place with our family He has a long history of saying hurtful things to me I am quite emotionally sensitive He has a history of coming to the home my fiancé and I have created and been disrespectful On a previous visit his dog destroyed the carpet in the guest bedroom Luckily I was able to fix it He apologized and offered to pay for the repair if we ever decided to have it repaired or replaced Well today it happened again His little dog destroyed the carpet in our master bedroom I had to excuse myself and cry it out again after our situation at the restaurant He didn t apologize for this one He never apologized for snapping at me at the restaurant Many times I ve felt hurt but endured it because he s my younger brother and I love him Today it feels different my heart is feeling so much sadness and break How can I address that I am hurt and establish ground rules for visiting without coming across as disrespectful I am so upset I am feeling like I need to ask he not come to our home if he is going to continue hurting me emotionally and being disrespectful Am I wrong for this",29,Female,sister

author: AsparagusPlastic3442
text body: First off I am a little unsure of proper reddit etiquette in terms of structure or special tags so you ll have to excuse any errors I make TLDR Older stepbrother former best friend Suddenly ghosted me for years attempted to hit on my wife later tried to claim it was my fault he never replies to messages 3 years since I cut all contact This is a long one so I will try to keep it as short as possible The older stepbrother in this story we will call Chad Chad and I were super close through my teenage years and into my 20s we would game together regularly and to be blunt he was more like my best friend So much so that in my mid 20s we ended up as neighbours for years with us renting a unit each in a duplex 2 separate units We got along great for years with Chad and his partner we will call her Jude and myself and my now wife let s call her Mary Anyway after a few years Chad and his partner were ready to buy their first home and moved away we were a little sad to see them go but also happy for them However about 6 months before they moved Mary and I started to notice they were distancing themselves from us Chad would arrive home from work and would avoid speaking to us would no longer message to meet online for a game etc Then after they moved into their new house we very rarely heard from them or saw them On top of this Chad would only reply to a message every month or two with minimal effort However whenever a sibling would message him tested several times they would get a response in minutes Now here where things really start to get interesting one day Mary and I were sitting down together at home when Chad messages Mary he s starts along the lines of saying he had a dream about her that it was a good dream but when questioned to its contents he says he can t say as he might get in trouble Long story short it was a round about way to test whether my wife was receptive to his flirting Several close friends have seen the messages and all have confirmed it was obviously a sleazy attempt carefully laced with plausible deniability Here s the thing about Chad though he s had 3 different affairs in the last decade without his partner leaving him and it s well known that he s far from loyal I probably should have been angry or reacted in some way But a part of me wondered if Chad was attempting to spark a reaction from me Other than sharing this incident with the rest of the family in our immediate circle we chose to just carry on as normal with screenshots of course just in case From this moment however I started changing my approach I stopped sending a message every few weeks or so but would still send an occasional message through in order to maintain my ability to be able to say that I at least tried to offer an olive branch to whatever his problem was Overtime it just became small updates on things we had a shared interest in Like when I was given 2 gaming computers to play around with I messaged him and blatantly mentioned how I had enough parts to build 2 running computers no interest or response So the second computer was given to my other close friend who also had an interest in building a gaming computer Or when I got a nice new electric guitar and stack amp guitarist for over 20 years pretty much hinting that I was well equipped to jam should Chad get that drum kit I knew he s been talking about for years drummer for just as long as I ve been playing guitar Other wise maybe once a month or so I would send a message just checking in and informing him of what new has been happening most of the time I wouldn t get a response but by then it s what I expected the main thing was that at a time when the entire family knew the score I was the only one who could say they tried Now to what kicked off the scenario we find ourselves in today which may be a little anticlimactic One of my other siblings invited several family members over for a get together I had plans at the time so my wife Mary went alone While she was there and outside alone Chad approached her and started a short conversation Chad basically told her that he found it hard to talk to me as I only want to talk about myself And largely just a soft attack on my personality and just generally trying to justify the fact he s ignored any attempt to interact with me for several years at this point to the point that the rest of the family all joke with him about not responding even though that s only the case with myself When my wife got home and filled me in on this I could only laugh and joke with her that he would actually have to respond to a message to continue the conversation passed the starter And after looking at the previous messages I had sent him where I spoke about myself I saw the time I was intending to give him a gaming computer if he had shown interest showed zero And the time I mentioned the new guitar was in the hopes that he would get another drum kit had been telling people for years that he was going to get one Then as I started to slowly buy and replace parts on my gaming computer I would send updates as to what I had been learning and reading about as I knew that he would likely start to build his own he did and used my build list to make sure he bought better parts too Anyway after he had said his piece to my wife Mary I decided I was done with trying and deleted his contact information It s been 3 years now with no contact other than token nods at family gatherings hosted by other siblings Mary and I got Married 2 years ago Chad and his partner were not invited We have a 6 month old son now who Chad and Jude have only met a couple of times in group settings with interactions kept to a minimum Jude is largely ignorant of everything however has since stopped bothering to message me I think she may feel it s awfully rude for me to not bother replying However she has maintained regular attempts to try and gain favour with Mary the best she has achieved was a lunch with Mary and my Mother which was largely circumstantial as Mary was my non driving mothers transport for the outing Sorry again for the novel as you can see if you have made it this far my story is a little petty and a long winded way to describe very little But I would love if anyone has some advice or insight My entire response to my older brothers side of things has basically been giving him what he wanted to begin with didn t want to talk to me doesn t have to be worried about that anymore and frankly I think I m better off without him and his partner in my life",,,brother

author: AsparagusWrong2728
text body: So my 59 year old mom died almost a year ago I am 34 It was an incredibly painful and mentally draining time for everyone in my family She was in her early 60s stage four esophageal cancer and passed quick in about two years time She chose to not do chemo radiation feeding tube I live far from my family so every few months I would come and visit them to create new memories and make sure they knew they were loved Literally the hardest few years of my life From the beginning of all this my dad made nothing easier he constantly would put his needs before the family and in so many ways is very childish I think he has undiagnosed learning disabilities which is the only way I can try to cope with how disrespectful he is to me and my brothers I had to be the adult in a lot of the decisions making and was thinking ahead of when the time came Examples one of the days I was staying with my parents and my dad and I were going shopping for the urn He didn t want my mom to know so we were looking without her knowing My dad wanted to leave earlier and literally interrupted my therapy session raising his voice that we have to go now The day my mom died he didn t have an urn funeral home picked out His way of coping with her death was to go urn shopping at that moment while her body lay there I had to basically yell at him and say be with your wife eventually her body won t be here I then went outside and called funeral homes to find the cheapest cremation in the area because my parents didn t save for a damn thing Anyways plenty of more examples there are for sure Fast forward she passes away My dad meets a new lady friend at thanksgiving at his mom s house like 3 months later He called my brother and I a month after they started dating saying he s sorry for being a shitty dad he wants to have a relationship with us he has to move on now it s gods will that he moves on a lot of life changes have occurred I made the joke about it being a female and he s like ha how d you guess It ended up being this new woman that all the sudden gave him the motivation to try to be in our lives he was calling me and my brothers asking how we were doing Super odd for us This didn t last long and was definitely a phase It wasn t maybe 3 4 months after dating he s becoming increasingly pushy about us meeting her Saying that she s amazing and they are more than friends and they won t do anything until she s been gone after a year I didn t care that he found someone I was annoyed sure but I didn t want him to die alone It s the fact that he constantly puts others before his kids When you try to talk him about my mom s death he just talks about how he lost a wife He s always the victim and can t understand why it would be way to soon for us to talk to her or meet her I also could never tell when he s talking or his gf she s sent texts under his name and it s just creepy Mostly recently her death anniversary is coming up I haven t talked to him recently because when I do it s incredibly draining and always about him He doesn t remember stuff anyways and hasn t been much of a father besides dna Anyways he calls and says he has a proposition I m intrigued He offers to come and visit during and or around my mom s year death anniversary I was like yeah that would be great I have a few days off I assumed it would be just him so I asked and he said the gf would be coming too but just as support She d keep herself busy on those days and she doesn t have to meet me This doesn t sit well and I told him I would have to think about if A few minutes later he calls back and says we need to clear some things up my gf is here and she wants to talk to you I immediately say no I want to talk to him he puts her on and lectures me for 7 minutes about how I need to be there for him and how he s so sad this week She said it was her idea for them to come up because she has flyer miles Wtf so he s not even paying I felt like I was being pressured She never asked about my feelings or thoughts just kept pushing that my dad needs me I ve never been asked through this process how I have felt we just have to constantly guess what he wants and try to make sure he doesn t get mad To mention they are both Christian s and we re saying stuff like it s gods will that we met etc I don t have a religion right now for context and he knows this She was also saying that she s not trying to be mother etc when she was done ranting I told them I would have to tink about it and get back to them This doesn t sit right with me Hubs is livid and heard the entire conversation Idk what to do I don t want them here I also want my feelings to be addressed and he won t do that He s so childish I was thinking of writing him a letter with very specific boundaries He will be mad ignore me throw a tantrum and play victim I just want other insight on their experience ms and maybe some insight im missing Am I being a butt I don t think I am but tell me if so Thanks",34,,

text body: I m 24 and from Argentina this will be relevant later on cause of the state of the country s economy And although it might be hard to believe although vague everything is 100 real I could give a lot of context but I think that is something only my shrink should hear Long story short I come from one of the founding families of the country Although the inheritance is nowhere close to what it would have been if Argentina kept itself out of socialism it s not that bad that would be if my father weren t an absolute mess of a person To this day we don t understand how he burned through 70 to 80 of the inheritance he received He just confides way too much in very little time in absolute strangers who inflate his ego and when we try to warn him about it he gets defensive and says all we care about is his money By the point I was 19 the main way we saw the subject was that we d have to build the wealth again on our own in the future and that s fine But 2021 came around and everything got really fucked up My father a writer started an online literature course for young adults This brought a sketchy 30 something year old man from the north of the country let s call him Dani who adored his work He stroked his ego a lot so he liked having him around as an assistant who helped him check for editorial blunders in his old work That was all fine with us until we saw Dani get jealous when my father spent his time or attention with anyone it wasn t him In a childish manner Then we found out he had access to all of my father s bank accounts and had started helping him invest his money into cryptos for context my father previously didn t manage his finances until very recently cause he was an absolute mess in keeping track and being organized My brother s mother and his best friend s niece saved him from filing for bankruptcy after his open heart surgery 4 years prior In appreciation he thanked them by accusing them of stealing funds from him that s why he currently manages his assets but not even that it seems like my father even gave him the writing of his own home the only state he had left and who knows what else Suffice to say we weren t big fans of Dani even more so when we heard that he stopped all sorts of moving or exercise cause of his work and his kneecap developed necrosis cause of an old surgery He dislocated his knee twice for not stay still in his recovery The second time I was in his home and took him to the hospital The next day I woke up to the happy surprise that Danny sent some crazy messages to the family group chat and to my brother pretending to be me and saying I had broken my father s leg and next was my mother My brothers father and I had a serious sitdown and everything came to light It seems like they were actually lovers Initially he said he was going to break it off after this but minutes later he told me he was going to choose Dani over us The next day he reported me to the police for cohesion supposubly for influencing him to do something he didn t want to do From there I cut him off and did a no contact Went into a deep depression where I almost didn t get out of bed for 6 months which got worse cause my mother didn t want me to train contact sports and in a fragile state convinced me to stop wrestling for an online course during my wrestling practice my sister had a manic episode and my brother almost broke his hip in a biking accident By the end of the year when I had barely started getting better and decided to lose the weight I had gained from my inactivity my mother changed the locks of the house cause she basically couldn t deal with me she gave me a month in hostel and told me I should figure it out how I fed myself This was in the middle of a 60 annual inflation in Argentina which the next year rose to 200 I won t go into details about my relationship with my mother as it s even more complicated and rooted in my childhood That is something I ve been working on for a couple of months now with my shrink Almost 2 years and a half later after a lot of hardship no savings and working and training as a dog 6 days a week I m semi stable Now after getting my own place and getting out of residencies living with violent cokeheads having a decent job and starting to find success in the sports I enjoy she says she loves me and misses me In one early dinner before I took a serious stand in cutting her out of my life she told me she doesn t regret any decision as I ve grown a lot through this experience I mostly only speak with my brother we don t share a mother and my aunt her sister who is constantly asking me to amend things with her and have a relationship for my sake I ve explained to her I don t trust her and I ll never will This is just the last and biggest trauma she made me endure But sometimes my mind tries to give her a chance or I m afraid of the day I ll have to explain to a significant other why I don t have a family basically am I in the wrong for just cutting everyone off and focusing on myself",24,,

text body: Hi I know this title is kinda weird but please stand by because i m turning crazy from the rage I feel I don t know if i m blowing things out of proportion or if i finally lost my mind First of all I d like to clarify english is not my first language and there might be a lot of mistakes in this text I am a 21F student who is currently living with my 54F mom and 52M I am on my 4th year of college but i m still missing 2 more years to complete my entire credits My career is chemistry not chemical eingeneering not biochemistry not any chemistry application just chemistry I was diagnosed with BPD in september 2023 and the main reason i m reactive with rage and depressive episodes is my family Let me tell you how our dinamic has been for a little backfround When I was a child my mother was in charge to raise both me and my now 20M brother My dad didn t want to be dragged into the hard work of raising us but he was the one who provided for all of us since he had a really stable job Because of that we could travel to a lot of places food was never a problem in our home and we never had to worry about money Also he was the one who always took us me and my brother to the park and play According to my mom she was the parent who always did corrections on us whenever we made a mistake she used to get really angry and sometimes spanked us and my dad was the parent whom their children did fun things with I can t really remember a lot of things in my infance because of trauma i had Growing up my mother always demanded us to have good grades here in mexico the grades go from 0 to 10 and if we got something below 8 she used to get really angry at us i remember her screaming and us and being disapointed at us if we had 7 or 8 in one exam our dad didn t really cared about that but he never confronted my mom about that nor anything else When i was 10 or 11 my dad was transferred to the capital and for 2 years we only lived with my mom and he took a plane and visited us every 2 weeks This really altered my perception because my mom now was fully encharged of raising us and my dad was not really in the picture and me and my brother never told dad how mom treated us always angry and how she was really hostile to us when i was 13 my dad asked my mom to go live with him or else he would leave her and couldn t continue like that For a 13 year old girl who had her entire life in that city that is upsetting i remember crying and begging to my mom to please stay in that city and she of course said no That s when I started self harming because i fell into a deep depression My mom was always cruel to us my brother was 11 and i had less than 6 months to enjoy my friends I remember that one month prior to moving to mexico city December 2016 we were in the US visiting my mathernal grandma and our dad got REALLY angry at us I don t even remember the reason The point is i cutted myself again and since my mom had found out about that 2 weeks prior to that incident she took me out of the bathroom and pulled my sleeve up and saw the fresh cuts i had just made she then started insulting me and dragged me with my dad and he well he didn t took it well i don t wanna go into details but he got physically aggresive with me and my mom didn t stop him and then when he calmed down he apologized crying and i was just feeling numb a month passed and we moved cities and when we were already living there i found out my dad was being unfaithful to my mom when i was checking his phone I just knee something was really wrong From that moment on i swore to myself that i would stop talking to my dad and that was our relationship for 7 years I didn t talk to him and whenever i did it was complete with rage and resentment my relationship with my mom was not good either she was always angry and really protecting of us i don t think controlling but something like that In 2022 i had my BPD triggered because of a guy i didn t really date but kinda did but that s a completely different story The result was awful I stopped feeling emotions and only felt a void which i described as my ground state chemistry term and besides that i also felt not anger but a really intense rage i stopped doing my hobbies and hanging out with friends and only focused on school in a sick way a year passed by and my mom was always angry at me because of my room it was always a mess and she blamed me for my mental health I was not diagnosed yet Some months passed by and i ended up at the psychiatrist s office with my mom because none of the therapy i had tried worked out that s when i got diagnosed with bpd and narcissistic traits also around that time my brother he was 17 started living in another state and i was the only one living with my parents also my best friend who was always with me in my house tried to take her own life but failed and she went back to her home town with her family so i was completely alone from that moment on i decided to forgive my father for all the things he did back then it really felt good to stop holding on to that resentment now with the actual story 2 years have passed from my diagnose and i ve learned how to live with it i now can control my splittings and i don t really bother anyone because i have silent bpd both my parents have learned a lot about my disorder and they try to support me the point is my mom hasn t gone to therapy when i ve asked her several times and she s really explosive with me she s the only one who can trigger my bpd and she does it a lot of times i feel like i m living in the shadow of my parents because i can t leave my house i have no money and i have a lot of problems with saving my money i feel guarded and trapped in my own home and i have to be careful so i don t make my mom angry today i was studying with my best friend and i told my mom about it and she told me she didn t believe me because yesterday i told her i was completely blocked and could not do any school work she believed i was with my boyfriend which she completely prohibited me to be with but that s a completely different thing when i was 2 hours deep in my homework she sent me a message that said I m picking you up now i m already on my way and i instantly got angry but left the library because if she arrived and i wasn t there she would be a thousand times angrier When i left the building i called my dad and my brother he s visiting us because of vacations if they were with my mom and they said she hadn t left the house yet and she was in the bathroom i got really angry and texted her what her problem was that i had stopped doing homework and she didn t even had left the house and she immediatly left the house when i texted her i was histerically sobbing in public because i was really angry and i felt like i was gonna explote when she arrived i didn t say a word to her and she saw how angry i was and didn t say a word to me either when we arrived home i immediately went to my room and started doing research on how to win money because i am completely saturated with this house the thing that hurts me the most is that 5 days ago she apologized to me for all the trauma that she gave me when i was little and said she would try to improve i am stuck here my mental health is getting worse and i have no money for therapy much less for moving out and since i don t know what else to do i decided to vent here where nobody knows me and people have objective opinions what should i do i am not kidding i have 400 MXN 20 USD approximately on my name and because of my school schedule i can t work maybe nobody will see this but even when i m writing this i feel much better If somebody is reading this please forgive me this is a complete mess and i tried to put my emotions into words",21,Female,

not useless in the derogatory manner I m about to be 24 and am married been together for 9 years We just had a baby and I had expectations about how to raise my child and the house we raise her in My

though so it s worth it More about my MIL Growing up her house was always a complete disaster a house of 9 people and always having trash food and clothes and broken items everywhere There was not an inch of the house that didn t have items in it If there was a shelf you couldn t see the wood it was made of Every knick knack had a story and every piece of broken furniture had a reason for staying Her fridge was full of food nobody ate or was even allowed to eat at times becuase they were saving it She was an extreme couponer who lost money on couponing She d buy 50 cans of corn just to never eat them When they were evicted out of their house it was bad enough the city just tore it down They moved ALL of their items to the storage unit I helped of course but only becuase if I didn t they d make my wife do it all with them Fast forward to today They live in Florida and rent out a house It looks much better but that s becuase they lost everything becuase they couldn t afford storage units in ohio forever It s slowly becoming more cluttered there but that isn t my problem My problem is the fact that she now flies up here every 2 weeks and fills my fridge with food And I don t mean she buys milk eggs and cheese She went to the grocery store bought enough food for 3 people for a month and it was mostly food only she liked She did it under the guise of buying us food but she knew that we didn t like most of what she bought She came home with 5 cases of soda 6 vitamin waters and threw them on the floor in my kitchen She then proceeded to order 4 boxes of LaRosa pizza even though altogether we only went through 2 and we could have COOKED something that she just bought or we had we meal prepped for 3 months She then also ordered 4 steak hoagie under the guise that Florida dosent sell steak hoagie And she ll take them back on her flight in a week gross She then also ordered dominoes and other fast food items I have thrown everything out before becuase when she leaves it all goes bad and we re here to clean it up But she dosent see it and dosent care I keep my fridge stocked but not full I have 3 racks and keep the necessities Milk eggs cheese creamer get to that in a second lunch meat bread vegetables soda and water I have more than that but know that there s space to put items if we need to but I prefer we eat what we have I grew up where if you didn t finish your food you ate it later She puts food in the fridge under the guise she will but then leaves back to Florida It s hard to explain without picture attachments in the SR but I think you get the point But if not just know it goes from being a fridge that has everything to feed a person but still having space to food literally falling out of the fridge and being expired before we can get through any of it Altgough we had other items she would being in clothes for baby that were too small and couldnt even fit her anymore puzzles and then leaving them half built shelf knick knacks plush animals were up to like 9 now of BIG ones and a few other big items that take up space in my room including clothes she left here and just left with them on the floor and in corners but Food is definitely the worst of it and we even had a blow up where she stated she was leaving early and it broke my wife s heart This has been going in for 4 months though and nothing had changed I m fed up and actually feel depressed about the entire situation I feel as though I haven t owned my own house for the last 4ish months Wwyd What even CAN I do I m not usually a pushover but for my wife s happiness I am But I bought a house for a reason I worked my butt off for 5 years straight doing 70 80 hour weeks to pay for this house to say I could have my own space There are a few factors to put in recently within the last week that have caused more people than usual to appear at my house but this has been an ongoing issue I can t even escape to my room or my basement becuase I ve made room for other people I m at my wits end and don t know what to do All my wife does is say don t be mad at me but I ve told her that it isn t her it s her mother and her mother s lack of respect for me my house my rules and how I feel I can t even control the temperature my house is at without her taking control and changing it in my sleep I can t go out to the garage without her running and getting more food or more knick knacks we never asked for or stuff we will never use I have thrown away over 2000 dollars of food and knick knacks over the last 4 months and it hurts my soul becuase that wasn t allowed as a child We ate it Not let it sit and rot Wwyd stuff like that I feel as though I can t explain how bad it actually is through text of that makes sense I ve never seen someone with a stomach staple have 4 separate drinks and 5 separate foods from 9 separate getting up to grab food sitting at one time I swear A coke a coffee and 2 half drank water bottles with 5 different foods she won t finish and will just leave sitting out in the living room or kitchen It s foul and I don t think I can ever understand",24,,

author: Internal_Penalty_416
text body: Hi everyone I m in a complicated situation with my family especially my brother M33 and his girlfriend F29 and I need some advice on how to take back control of the narrative and find peace A while ago I went through a very tough time I was moving struggling with mental health and trying to survive my master s studies and teaching responsibilities in a new city without much of a support system During that time my brother and his girlfriend helped me move I truly appreciated it but it seems like that favor has been silently hanging over my head ever since They never said it outright but there s an unspoken expectation like I owe them and nothing I do seems good enough After the move things really started to go downhill My brother began promising things like visiting me helping me out picking me up from the station so I could attend birthdays or family events and then just not showing up Not even cancelling just ignoring me I d be left standing at the station or waiting all day completely emotionally crushed Meanwhile I was already hanging on by a thread trying to build a new life while feeling isolated overwhelmed and burned out He did listen to me on the phone quite often during that time I d talk to him about how hard things were for me and he seemed to be there But it was always on his terms when he had time or felt like it And he d also often vent about our parents and how things were with them It wasn t one sided but again always on his conditions When I tried to give something back I helped them with their house renovations But no matter what I did it wasn t good enough My brother was often stressed and reacted aggressively on two occasions physically rough and Julia just ignoring it He later apologized but the impact stayed with me His girlfriend Julia always backs him up and tends to control how we interact It feels like she decides everything what happens who s involved and he just follows her lead On top of that whenever I was at my parents place my mom would constantly control and direct me how I should behave how I should feel especially around my dad I always have to be cheerful agreeable helpful There s no space to just be When I try to set boundaries or express how I feel I m told I m overreacting being dramatic or playing the victim Last year Julia organized a family outing and didn t invite me That hurt I tried to reconnect by organizing something myself later which actually went well A month and a half ago they came to visit me My brother kept physically teasing me in ways that crossed my boundaries When I addressed it calmly afterward he laughed it off I then sent a stronger message saying that if it happened again I wouldn t want to see him anymore Julia responded by saying that s not how you treat family and demanded I pay for a dinner I never even asked her to pay for Then they posted cheerful family photos on social media like nothing had happened That felt like a slap in the face Out of frustration I blocked her The next day she called to say I m always too emotional and that they re always the ones caring for me but I never do anything for them But they never acknowledge my perspective They only focus on what they don t get from me and never on what I do give which is never enough in their eyes anyway My brother no longer communicates with me directly everything goes through Julia I ve told him this is between us but he ignores me Julia holds all the power in the dynamic and my brother enables it My mom pressures me to apologize and tells me I m still welcome if I come over separately and if I m in a good mood Again conditional acceptance Always They also celebrated Easter and my dad s birthday together without me and keep posting happy pictures about random stuff in the family group chat while she keeps me blocked on social media It s this strange mix of exclusion and performance that just adds to the pain I even sent Julia a gentle message saying I hope we can talk when you re ready and I understand if you need more time but I realize now I made myself small again I gave her control And that s not sitting right with me In about 8 weeks I have my master s graduation expo I really want my parents to be there But I m scared they won t come because of all this tension and the fact that my disabled sister needs care something they usually handle together It requires planning I don t know if I should try to resolve all this before the expo or put it aside and focus on my studies I feel like I ve completely lost control of how I m seen in this family Julia drives the narrative my brother follows and I m always either the problem or the emotional one I m exhausted I want to be seen for what I m going through For what I ve already given Not punished for not meeting their silent expectations How do I take back control of the narrative How do I deal with this exclusion the imbalance and the silence Should I reach out again or wait until after my expo I m emotionally drained and this is affecting my ability to concentrate on what s supposed to be one of the most important moments of my life Any advice would be so appreciated TL DR Brother M33 and his girlfriend F29 helped me during a rough patch but it now feels like I m silently indebted He promised support and never followed through They exclude me ignore boundaries and control communication I feel erased With my graduation expo coming up I want my family there but don t know how to handle the tension How do I take back control of how I m seen in this dynamic",33,Female,

author: Boose_Loose
text body: I have a sister in her early mid 20s who is married to her husband in his late 20s They are currently living rent free in a small upstairs room of my parents house and also own a dog The room smells horrible while the rest of the house is meticulously kept beautiful by my mother The carpets are destroyed and the walls are damaged within their room What is much worse however is the backyard and property around the house My parents have put lots of money and hard work to maintain a beautiful yard yet the dog has destroyed the lawn by running in the same places over and over leaving an unsightly dirt trench Additionally the dog poop is left all over the place with a litteral mountain of poop in one corner of the backyard My parents have asked them to take the dog elsewhere and clean up but my sister does not want to cooperate and has even resulted to physical blows towards my parents when asked to do simple things that should be common sense It gets even worse since the husband is a mechanic and has at least 3 vehicles and a trailer on the premesis all of which barely function and require him to dump money into keeping them funcational which money obviously could be used to buy a good car that actually works or you know pay rent The cars are ugly and take up a lot of space Even the neighbors have complained because of the ugly vehicles parked on the street and beside the house My mother accepted my sister and her husband back into her house when they were kicked out of their previous residence If not for my mother they would have been homeless The husband is employed and makes roughly 50k a year My sister is unemployed and refuses to work for mental health issues I don t doubt that she has had trauma but it is extremely evident that she could work but simply doesn t want to She stays in her room all day and only leaves to take the dog outside once or twice a day All of the money made by the husband is wasted within days of each paycheck in car parts uber eats and other unnesessary expenses They refuse to move out and say that they cannot afford a house paying rent I earn the same amount as the husband and live in an appartment with my wife who is unable to work currently as we are waiting for her green card We live easily off of my income in the same area as my parents proving that my sister and her husband could rent an appartment and survive My parents need them to move out and to be more independant The obvious solution would be to tell them to respect the house rules or move out but my mother does not want to ruin her relationship with my sister Not only that but my sister has even threatened suicide and resulted to violence as I mentioned earlier when confronted about the situation It has gotten so bad that my mother wants to sell the house to have a good reason to get away from everything My father is in the same boat as my mother Both are extremely patient and kind to my sister but they are suffering Any thoughts or tips would be appreciated I am very curious to see what others would have to say about this whole mess",,,sibling

text body: sorry for bad grammar English is not my first language I m almost turning into an adult and my family is surprised that I don t know anything basic e g mopping the floor shaving doing laundry etc They always blame me for not observing and watch and learn but because of that I started to become shy when I attempt to clean around the house And to add insult to injury all my relatives expect me to end up like my mentally ill mother I was raised by my auntie my whole life since my mom is in rehab and my father left us My auntie has a different style of teaching basic life skills like I said earlier she expects me to learn and watch then immediately know but never pushed me to my limits and actually taught me physically because she was so used to teaching everyone that because of her daughter that ended up being more of a clean freak than her I get it she wants me to be like her but people are different they learn differently Some others easily learn to do it and some progress slowly I am that person that progress slowly I was never used to cleaning because I was never encouraged taught and motivated I feel like it s all my fault because they bombard me a lot that I ll never make it out alive as an adult I forgot to mention that all my relatives blame my auntie for raising me but she s a genuinely nice person but she s just stuck in the old ways of teaching a kid how to clean I just feel so sympathetic when I m around her It s difficult talking to her about her ways of teaching because she always finds ways to get to my soft spot My brother is also like my other relatives He always insults me and tells me that I m lazy and judges everything I do but at the end he never taught me how to clean and do things Everyone in this family is insufferable That s why I m too shy to clean they judge everything I was never meant to be in this family nor be alive but at the end it s fate anyway on why I ended up in this family I am slowly learning how to do basic life skills because of my friend who volunteers to help me clean cook do the laundry cook rice etc I just hope I make it alive as an adult If you re also in a situation like me and was never taught by your parents or family I think it s time to learn on your own or get help from a friend There s multiple videos and forums on how to do basic life skills than your parents never taught you And if you guys have any cleaning suggestions and tips please comment I d appreciate it Especially cooking tips Peace out",,,

author: Ok_Phrase4779
text body: Hello Reddit I have been struggling on and off with my parents for most of my adult life As much as journaling constantly about my gripes and sorrows to myself I d like some feedback from others Maybe connect with people who are going through similar experiences Sorry for the length it all had to come out The Backstory Myself now mid 30 s Male have divorced parents they unfortunately waited until I was in my early 20 s to divorce I experienced a full childhood of screaming swearing yelling slamming and breaking things emotional manipulation from my mother and physical abuse from my father My mom ruled with guilt and embarrassment as her tools of the parenting trade She would host small get togethers all the time and embarrass me constantly by revealing very personal things about me or things that I did as a child This would happen in front of the entire group while I was present It was a constant habit Sometimes her guests would directly tell her that it wasn t nice appropriate right after she said it and she would pretend to act sorry and surprised like she didn t know what she did If she wanted things done Guilt Always a guilt trip Everything My father was silent until he wasn t A real MOAB type He would sit in his recliner after work with a stack of beers and watch Star trek You could never get his attention On the rare occasion that i dared get his attention I would just yell DAD right infant of his face and it couldn t budge his attention When it was finally time for his bi weekly twice a week blowout you could guarantee the entire neighborhood knew what was happening And occasionally the local PD It would start with questions accusations of something that was said done not done touched or broken After a few minutes when he didn t get the answered he was expecting there was always the typical slap across the face to start it all off It was always by surprise my guess was on purpose once you released it was coming it had already happened Things would always escalate The yelling was always ear piercing The comments were always degrading Kids are little shits when you have kids that s all you have Worthless Ungrateful As I got older Cocksucker Little Fucker The list goes on Hard to remember when you re getting held against the wall by your throat not being able to reach the floor Or being punched in the face held down on the bed hair being pulled and being dragged The Now Myself still mid 30 s male twice Married two children First wife left me for another man A true hallmark blessing after a totally garbage marriage that happened too young She ended up with someone 5 times as worse as myself at that time That divorce allowed me to figure out what this shell has inside of it I gained confidence for the first time Knew who I was and what I was about Found the love of my life who I had known most of my adult life already I m very happy and content with my immediate life and family The ones under my roof To be honest I never get the urge to reach out to my family I feel guilty for not feeling anything towards either of them like it s my fault I feel like I still downplay the abuse I endured as a kid It s wild to write out even a fraction of it and still be like damn My relationship with my parents is still strained My mom tries to pretend she loves me and her grandkids My father either completely refuses to acknowledge any terrible things he did or brags in front of people that his beatings really got his kids in line My Mom lives for the public image of herself Attention is her drug and Facebook is her paraphernalia She jumps from female partner to female partner She lets them spoil her rotten and does nothing from them in return When the wow effect of her LGBTQ lifestyle wears off she moves on to another She see s her grandchildren very seldom maybe 4 times a year Never asks about them But has no issue spending time and posting pictures of other peoples children or her nieces nephews all over Facebook You know Family stuff I ve brought up her behavior countless times We ve had plenty of blowouts and periods of not talking Nothing changes She ll try for a few days but she genuinely just isn t interested And I find it almost impossible to try on my end I ve just got nothing to give honestly Despite living 10 minutes away she NEVER comes by When she does it s brief An hour max She s always got social obligations On the rare occasion she watches the kids she s ready to give them back the second I drop them off There s just nothing to build off of My Dad has tamed down quite a bit since the divorce When my mom left I was the one there quite literally picking him off the floor He emptied the house of pretty much everything He refused to celebrate holidays for a while I would buy him a Christmas tree and set it up for him to surprise him and he would just act irritated He finally started getting better over the course of a couple of years I would always be over there spending time with him doing things for him He suddenly ALWAYS talked about grandkids Obsessed with the thought and excitement of potentially having them someday And all the things he would do with them He then met his now wife who came with a whole entire family Expanding on that later My first wife had gotten pregnant at this time We shared the exciting news with him and received a very disappointing reaction Oh cool he says Come to find out my now stepsister had JUST had a baby boy She was completely reliant on her mom doing and paying for everything for her A real leech type My dad had been taking this boy to doctors appointments shopping you name it they were doing it together My little buddy he would say right in front of me as I hold his only granddaughter in my arms Who he still has NEVER watched once or done anything with I still feel that disappointment to the day A couple years later I gave him his first ACTUAL grandson And my step sister has given him another grandson by marriage around the same time He spends a crazy amount of time with the two of them while his actual grandkids see him 3 times a year maybe Also only lives 15 minutes away I know this is forever long and I will try to wrap it here But I feel like some backstory is important I m trying to find a way to let the resentment go but it s literally the only thing I have The only thing I have control of I feel like both my parents have lost their minds Or never had them I don t think my father has the mental capacity to be capable of self reflection I think he genuinely doesn t think anything about his actions then and now Not in a mean way he s just a simple man And was also very abused by his military father I don t want to continue on giving my parents the satisfaction of showing up for rare family events and answering nothing but question text messages I think ideally l d just like to let go of that connection or the placeholder for the connection It s my opinion that your blood family should take some sort of precedence over the family you married into Been with his wife for about 5 years Not to say he shouldn t be doing anything with his other grandkids by marriage But if my grandkids aren t getting ANY involvement neither should they His new family is definitely top priority And his step children are so dependent on them financially childcare and just all around help with life that they and their children are ALWAYS at his house My mom is a lost cause I m irritated with her fakeness her lack of involvement and her inability to settle down and sit still for more than 10 minutes I don t know if there s anything to rebuild there I think I m mostly just bothered by the injustice of it all and not the actual lack of relationship on either side Maybe someone will find this interesting or relatable Or want to share their similar experiences I don t know just wanted to get it out there TL DR Parents abusive during Childhood Now parents have a new life and are totally uninvolved with their grandkids and myself but spend plenty of time with literally anyone else",35,Male,son

text body: TW talks of suicide and brief mention of domestic violence Recently my grandmother has been putting more pressure on me to get back in touch with my father after just a year and a half of him loosing custody It s kind of a long story but my parents had a very messy divorce that got finalized just a couple of years ago The reason for the divorce is because my father cheated a lot on my mom for about a decade this is important later I was also much closer to my father at the time Before the divorce was finalized he has split custody of me and my brother and we live in a crap apartment that was just a year away from getting demolished for health code violations Black mold in the ceiling and broken appliances that backed up with sewage water making the place smell horrific 24 7 On top of that my dad lost the plot daily baratements for the smallest things a lack of food that I could eat I would cook him meals though I rarely got to eat any of it always high or drunk sometimes driving me when under the influence and neglect It got to the point where I stared to sleep in the closet because I was so scared It didn t help that my brother and I had to share a bed Eventually I couldn t take it any more and I broke down in front of a teacher and CPS was contacted CPS did jack shit shocker and I was returned back to my father for the worst time in my life He let it slip while screaming at my for 2 hours that quote the only reason I cheated was because your mother wanted you I never wanted a second kid I cheated because of you You put so much strain on the marriage and me Your mother and brother could have lived a normal life if it wasn t for you That really hit me I can t say this enough he KNEW I was suicidal I had gone to a psychiatrist scored the worst on depression and anxiety tests my psychiatrist SAID himself that I was at high risk to commit suicide Though my dad said that I couldn t be suicidal because of where I lived and how he treated me well Despite this I had been returned early to my moms the week prior because I told her I wanted to commit So he KNEW what he was doing After he screamed himself hoarse he let me go to my room where I later attempted Half way through my attempt mom found out what I was trying to do and tried to pick me up my father refused and locked me in a room until the police were contacted He then let me out because it was a bad look to lock your daughter in a room I guess Then made me cook dinner for him while I was sobbing relentlessly while he lectured me for going to my mom and saying that once again I couldn t be suicidal In the end I was taken to the hospital and had a stent in there it was very helpful and made me realize how bad the last couple of years had been Side note I wouldn t have gone if my father had no food it was the only thing I really cared about at the time At this point I hated my father I would sit there in scrubs and he would complain about work and the fact that I shouldn t be in there because everything was fine My mom started the process to gain more custody and when I was released I only had to stay a couple more days at my father s before he lost full custody One day every weekend was the norm and all party s agreed but my father He complained that it would be inconvenient for him to drive from his girlfriend s house back to his home to see me so he chose 2 days a month instead His girlfriend of 9 months The first time I wnt to see him after the custody change I was met with another moment of hell when I was trapped for 8 hours being screamed at for trying to take t Rex shaped salt and pepper shakers Saying it was like I didn t want to see him anymore and blaming me for him losing custody It got so bad by the end of the day I was back in the hospital for a week because I attempted again once I got home to my moms He finally fully lost custody and can t contact me All of this brings me to now My brother is graduating soon so family is coming to visit and my grandma want me to see him again I am really unsure of what to do now because I don t want to hurt her by outright refusing though also I don t want to see my dad again I am also unsure of weather or not she knows the full situation but she is also not a good person Shes a narcissist who enables my father behavior She s coming in a couple of weeks and I am super nervous to meet her and I don t know what to say Oh and my dad hasn t improved at all if anything he s gotten worse he now trades weed for sex from prostitutes is a chronic cheater and liar has had domestic violence charges put against him by several women and currently is in a dire financial situation",14,Female,

text body: So if you look through my post history you ll see I m a bit of an asshole I m F29 and it s taken me until the last few years to really take responsibility and accountability for my life And while I have now accepted that it s my responsibility I still acknowledge that it s my parents that set me up for failure In light of everything i decided I wanted to give an honest go at repairing the relationship with my parents and was successful with my mom I ve reached out to my dad and he asked to wait a bit but I have not heard back from him I m questioning whether it s the more accountable thing to remind him of our talk or if I should take this as a sign that I should be at peace with the fact that he really doesnt care about me I decided already that I m not going to be the one keeping up appearances and chasing after his love and approval Extremely condensed life recap for context on me and my dad s relationship I am the first born of 5 daughters and my dad was an ordained preacher now Catholic priest My parents spanked and believed in authoritarian style parenting When I was 8 my parents converted to Catholicism and did not tell us anything other than we were moving schools and churches Then when I was 9 we moved across the country so dad could go to catholic school to learn catholic theology They homeschooled us after that They never checked in with me about the move I took it extremely hard and we were bullied by neighborhood kids for being converts I felt neglected and as I grew older my dad s ultra conservatism locked down everything in my life No video games no boyfriends no staying out late no graphic novels no music that wasnt Christian no clothing that was too short too revealing you get the idea Follow don t question He complained I never wanted to share anything with him but I argued that if I did he would just say everything I liked was bad I was depressed which led to me being suicidal in my 20s He did not allow me to grow as a person or explore regular teenage thoughts and experiences He forced me to go to college where I realized I would not care if he died I lived with a boyfriend and some friends as roommates we weren t even sleeping in the same room in my 20s and when he found out he tried to make him move out but I finally put my foot down I eventually moved across the country and maintain extremely little contact Overall I feel like my dad never listened to me never cared what I had to say and always believed that he was doing the best thing for me according to his religion One time I even told him I wished he wasnt my dad and all he said was I m sorry you feel that way This man rarely apologizes never takes accountability and does not reward you for doing the right thing if you made mistakes along the way I don t have a lot of nice things to say about him because I resent him All of the good things he did for me will never be enough I grew up always thinking I was a bad daughter for hating him because he was doing the right thing and I was the wrong one Now that I m taking control of my own life I m trying to find the line between this is what a mature person should do and this is just what you ve been conditioned to do If anyone needs more context I can elaborate below Succinctness isn t my strong suit",29,Female,daughter

text body: Full disclosure my dad is a good guy We get along with many things he s good to talk to about more sensitive topics and all that However he lives with me and my grandma has for as long as I can remember with some sparatic periods where he d leave Now living her he is 59 years old and disabled but even prior to this he has given my grandma grief She is by no means the nicest and has a sharp tongue Although she still does for her kids and grandkids the best she can He has said things that he would spit on her grave call her all kinds of names and she still let s him live here It has gotten to the point where she moved a lot of his junk that he hoards in the backyard off to the dump my Uncle was involved and now he is saying she is a thief My issue is that he has been using my car for nearly a year He messed up the paint loaded it with crap in my car and it is just unsightly He claimed it was not running well and he needed to fix it being the only one who can drive it because I can t I m not loaded with money to get it fixed and he started using it right before my grandpa was in the hospital who eventually passed so him having my car was the last thing on my mind and I was going into my last semester of college Fast forward now I graduated and I have my degree e and just trying to get on by What happens He gets into a car accident with my car He wants me to cough up 1 700 to him to get this truck from MY settlement for MY car he has been abusing All because my grandma and him cannot get along and he wants to move all his stuff which my little hatchback can t move and that truck can I am so flustered and fed up with giving him and going along with things and like I said this is not something new because my grandma never kicked him out when my grandpa wanted to and used the excuse of being a mother that she couldn t do it I am having a hard time myself saying no because that s just how she raised me and I love him but I don t think he deserves a penny from me just because he put time and money into fixing my car He only paid me for like 3 4 payments on it recently keeps using toll roads all the while I have been using my grandma s car to get to work and do what I have to do At this point it isn t my car anymore I want it gone he doesn t deserve any of my money but I don t know how to bring it up to him I hate that I am this way but I guess I wanted to rant and hear others opinions on it Thank you for listening",,,son

text body: So a bit of context my older sister moved back to our home country third world country since she gone to study and work in a first world country last year after giving birth to her baby boy She s been no contact with our parents for over 10 years now due to some deep rooted childhood trauma She went through things with them that I didn t partly because of our big age gap I was born much later and didn t experience the same treatment she did Because of that she s always been very clear with me don t tell our parents anything about her where she is what s going on in her life how the baby is I ve respected that boundary even though it puts me in an incredibly uncomfortable position She ll ask about them whenever I visit how they re doing what they re up to and I always feel torn I try to answer carefully but it feels like no matter what I say I m betraying someone On the other side my parents constantly ask about her They still care deeply and want to reconnect but I lie or give vague answers to protect their peace because I know if they found out I was in contact and keeping it from them they d feel hurt and betrayed So I end up being this emotional filter for everyone else s feelings while mine just get pushed aside When she moved back I tried to be there for her But the emotional weight of her expectations was a lot She would always invite me over regardless of my schedule or energy and if I couldn t come she d guilt trip me with things like we re family or your nephew won t even know you It started to feel less like connection and more like obligation She s no contact with our parents and our other sister too so I became her only outlet And the thing is I m broken too I ve been dealing with my own emotional struggles and had nothing left to give I didn t feel like I could say that to her So I just stopped replying It s been 9 months now I haven t blocked her I haven t responded I don t even open the texts anymore She calls me sends long messages tries to reach out but I ve gone completely silent And now she s been sending me guilt ridden defensive messages saying I ve abandoned her like everyone else And part of me agrees but another part of me knows I was trying to protect myself How do I come back from this Should I respond at all Am I the villain for choosing silence when I didn t know how to speak my truth I still care about her But I also care about my own peace And I don t know how to hold both",25,Female,sister

text body: My dad has never been there for me since he left our state years ago He has full access to me and my siblings in terms of contact but he never reaches out and we gave up on trying to keep up a relationship When he moved back to our state he never asked to see us and never once asked to talk to my brother He sends us presents during holidays and birthdays only me and my brother tho he ignores my older sister which is why I feel nothing but resentment towards any gifts I get or try to hide them from her and he even forgot my birthdate He called me out of the blue weeks before my 18th birthday and was genuinely confused when I told him it wasn t my birthday yet He kept saying how it felt like an important date to him and it just so happened to be on January 6th that he called believing it to be an important date like my birthday I have my own interpretation but take of that what you will So now I m 19 having been low contact with him for years and he s been asking me about graduation He asked me months ago and I truthfully did not have an answer I just said something along the lines about how I didn t know yet and prayed he d forget But he s asked again I directed him to the school website saying how hectic everything is and how all my dates are scrambled up but that the school website should definitely have it He told me he couldn t find it I essentially just responded Aw dang sorry school redid their entire website out of the blue which wasn t a lie its made everyone confused about the sudden change and I just don t know how I m supposed to tell him no Like this man has not been apart of my life for years and he suddenly wants to be there and play pretend for my big moment I m fucking fuming thinking about it I don t want him or his new family there But i also can t upset him because he thinks he s the victim all the time We kept going home early as kids when we d visit him because he d end up screaming and yelling at us every single fucking time and instead of taking the hint and managing his anger he instead decided to ghost us his children for 6 months and refused to see us at all not even for our weekly dinners which were generally much nicer than weekends Anytime he has a falling out with friends it was always their fault never his And I m afraid that he ll do the same thing with me because I still need him for my education It s selfish I know but it s the only good thing he can give me and I don t want him to be petty and refuse to transfer the bill to me He got disabled while in the military becuase he s now disabled and in his kid I get to have so much of my education paid off and he s already being difficult by refusing to give us the info we need he just told us to call some number for his information which I m already scared about because the last time he said that it was about our dental insurance and we could not get ahold of the right people to get me to a fucking dentist I have to send in an application to see if the bill is transferred to my name and if it isn t my father will have to and I can t trust him on these things especially if he thinks he s been slighted I m at such a loss Mom keeps telling me to direct him to her but I m afraid that it s just gonna lead to him asking me to ask her for him and that if I refuse he ll realize I m lying about not knowing the date or wanting him there which I ve never said I wanted him there but I ve never said the opposite I m thinking of telling him the date but making sure I avoid him at all costs idk I feel nauseous thinking about it It s just next to impossible to have a conversation with him over text and I refuse to see him face to face after everything he s done to my siblings and mother TL DR absent father wants to attend my graduation I don t want him there but my future education could be at risk if I upset him by saying I don t want him there",19,,sibling

text body: A little back story Back in 2012 I had a custody dispute with my daughter s father I asked for support after 9 years We came up with an agreement but he reniged when I wanted to add in the agreement that we d revisit the agreement in 3 years This is standard for Domestic Relations support orders So I filed for support through domestic relations A week before our hearing he had his wife get my daughter from school and not tell me I was supposed to have her per our verbal agreement Ultimately he wouldn t let me see her alienated her from me and I had to file for custody to get her back We both experienced a lot of trauma that I am still addressing in therapy to this day Current day issues My daughter is now expecting her first child I threw a baby shower for her last weekend and per her request I invited her dad his wife their children and his in laws I sucked it up for her as I to this day do not like either of them or her family for their participation in the trauma I have expressed to my parents and sister how horrible I feel when they are friendly with him and his family and act all buddy buddy with them It hurts me and makes me feel betrayed At the shower my ex was 2 inches away from me and didn t say a word I was fine with that Come to discover my sister spending a significant amount of time standing outside talking to him When my mom arrived she asked if she could say hi to him since we were walking by I just responded that my sister has been talking to him forever so she may as a well just say hi to him Come to find out later that my mom spent a lot of time talking to his wife and her mother I again feel hurt and betrayed by my mom and sister s actions I at this point feel like just cutting them out of my life My dad was there too and was respectful to me and my wishes All of them claim they don t like him The trauma was so bad that I have asked them if he shot or stabbed me would they still talk to him Well what I went through is worse and taking a lot longer to heal I hosted my family yesterday for East r dinner and if course discussion about my ex and his family comes up When we were done eating I just got up and left the table and started cleaning up in the kitchen I just keep feeling betrayed by the people that are supposed to support me In all fairness they re not very supportive about anything Would I be the asshole if I cut my sister and mom out of my life",32,Female,Mother

text body: Hello guys I m going post it here and I m open with advice and opinions on what I should do and ano kaya ang magandang setup sa family namin Thanks po in advance Context Nagsimula ito noong nagwork si mother as OFW Ilang araw pa lang ang makalipas gusto na ni father na pauwiin si mother kasi hindi niya raw kaya Si father and grandmother side ni mother is nagkaroon ng conversation and it has two sides A According to my father minaliit daw siya at dinuro duro at isa raw ito sa sinabi sa kanya Ikaw ang sama ng ugali mo kaya hindi ka maka alis makapag abroad yung anak ko mabuti kaya siya nasa abroad Witness din si brother sa nangyari ang tumetestigo siya na narinig niya yon Additional context nag abroad kasi si father and na deny yung application niya and malaking pera na rin yung nagastos doon B According naman sa side ni mother ko ang naging usapan daw is binibigyan nila ito ng payo at niri realtalk isa raw ito sa mga naalala nila na sinabi nila May pera ba tayo para pauuwin siya wala naman di ba Ang naging outcome neto is eto ang sinasabi sa akin ng father ko Muntik na akong mabaliw minsan naiisip kong tumakbo sa labas nang nakahubo t hubad buti nakayanan ko Ang stand ni father is hindi naman daw kasi siya ang nagtulak kay mother na mag abroad pero bakit parang sa kanya galit na galit yung grandmother namin That s one thing but there s more Time passed si grandmother and one of my tita is pumunta sa house namin para makisuyo para doon magstay si grandmother since si tita ay may pinapagawang bahay na malapit lang din sa amin Nakita nila yung urn abo ni lolo father ni father and sinabi ni grandmother and tita kung pwede bang alisin yan habang nakaturo pa doon sa urn Walang imik lang yung father ko and hindi siya nagalit that time Tume testigo rin yung brother ko na narinig niya nga iyon According to my grandmother and tita hindi raw nila maalalang sinabi nila yon or if nasabi man nila yon ay sorry raw Nakausap ko lang sila about diyan few days ago There s more one time dumalaw si grandmother sa house namin and pinatuloy siya ni tatay sa kabila ng may galit ito sa kanya My grandmother and my father had a conversation grandmother said alam mo ba yung dating manliligaw ni mother ko nakapundar na ng ganito ganyan That time hindi nagalit si father or walang sinabi na masama patungkol dito According to my mother s side si grandmother is mahilig lang talagang magku kwento ng kung anu ano pero hindi niya raw intensyon na saktan yung feelings ni father Any statements na galing sa side ng mother ko is few days ago ko lang nalaman since restricted ako at kami ng mga kapatid ko na pumunta dahil hindi nga okay si father sa side ng mother ko dahil sa mga issues years ago Puputulin ko na diyan dahil napakaraming rants or kasalanan ng side ni mother ko kay father Problem Last day April 18 2025 inaya kami ni mother namin na sumama sa kanya para pumunta sa relatives namin dahil holy week Pumayag naman kami ni brother na sasama kami lalo na ako kasi minsan lang ako pumayag kay mother na samahan siya sa relatives namin Nakita kami ni father na nakabihis then sinabi niya na ayaw niya raw kaming tumuloy at kapag tumuloy daw kami is magagalit siya sa amin kung gusto raw ni mother na tumuloy mag isa ay siya na lang since galit nga si father doon sa side ni mother dahil sa mga nangyaring issues and hindi lang ito yung time na pinagbawalan niya kaming pumunta sa mga relatives namin it s been more than a 1 year or 2 since yung last na punta ko sa side ni mother dahil ayaw kong mapagalitan ako ni father kasi ang dating sa kanya neto is bakit kami pupunta sa taong nanakit nangmaliit nang alipusta sa kanya bakit kami makikisaya sa kanila So bilang pagpapakita ng respect sa father namin hindi kami sumama kay mother ang ending is tumuloy si mother mag isa Tapos habang naiwan kami sa bahay inabot ng apat na oras yung rants niya about sa side ni mother at nakikinig lang kami kapag nagsasalita siya patungkol sa bagay na yon Fast forward dumating si mother 8 PM or 9 PM na yon ng gabi and my father confront my mother ang sabi ni father bakit inaaya raw kaming magkakapatid na pumunta doon sa relatives namin na walang pahintulot niya dapat daw is ipapaalam sa kanya at wag daw siyang i bypass at magsasabi sa kanya sapagkat may karapatan daw siya sa aming mga anak niya dahil may authority daw siya Nakaharang naman ako kay father habang nagsasalita siya kasi alam kong possible na saktan niya si mother Sinubukan niyang saktan si mother ngunit inawat namin siya sumigaw si mother ng tumawag kayo ng pulis habang umiiyak siya Naawat naman namin si father and nilayo namin siya kay mother After ng nangyari hindi pa rin natigil si father na magsasalita ng mga hinanaing niya sa side ni mother at kay mother na kesyo unfair daw si mother sa kanya dahil hindi raw siya pinagtanggol sa pamilya niya na kesyo bakit sa kanya matapang magsalita si mother pero sa pamilya niya wala siyang boses na sabihin yung mga pinaggagawa kay father Nagpatuloy din siya sa pagmumura and nagbanta rin ito sa buhay ni mother ito ang mga sinabi niya Magpapatawag ka pa ng pulis papatayin kita bago ako makulong gago Gusto mo partidahan pa kita kumuha ka ng kutsilyo diyan nang magkaalaman tayo ngayon kapag nahawakan kita babaliin ko leeg mo Di ako magpapatalo sa yo gago Impyerno tayo dito Hindi laging nandito yang mga anak mo Nagpa blotter si mother sa barangay yung mismong gabi din na yon at doon muna siya nagstay sa mother niya Side note Sa loob ng 13 years na nasa abroad si mother as OFW ay okay naman si father hindi siya nagloko nambabae wala siyang bisyo nasa bahay lang talaga siya most of the time and okay naman siya sa pagraise sa amin sa pag asikaso sa amin he thought us well naman he wants us to be independent he wants us to be successful para raw hindi kami matulad sa kanya at hindi raw namin sapitin yung sinapit niya which is inaalipusta at minamaliit daw siya ng side ni mother dahil wala siyang trabaho etc etc Mabuti naman ang mga sinasabi ni father na need namin maggive back sa mother namin since si mother ang nagtaguyod sa amin Ang ayaw ko lang is kapag nagagalit siya at nag aaway sila ni mother kasi laging naoopen yung problems and issues sa kabila lagi niyang naipapasok yon Additional context Even before kapag nag aaway si mother and si father hindi nagpapatalo si father Isa rin yon sa mga sinasabi niya na bakit siya magpapatalo sa asawa niya e babae lang yon at lalaki siya siya dapat ang masusunod magpasakop dapat si mother sa kanya kasi ayun daw yung nasa Bible May time rin na nag away si mother and father noong bago pa lang silang mag asawa and pinalayas ni father si mother habang buntis si mother kay panganay Noong maliliit pa raw kami sabi ni mother hindi raw kami pinagbubuksan ng gate ni father dahil galit ito nakakaya raw nito na tiisin kami kapag nagagalit ito So basically may anger issues si father and nasa lahi nila yon kasi ganun din yung mother niya and mga kapatid niya Even silang magkakapatid is matatapang din e Sana matulungan ninyo po ako kung anong dapat gawin and anong setup ang magandang gawin sa family namin and ano po ba yung mga karapatan namin bilang anak ano rin ba yung mga karaparan niya bilang father and ano rin ang karapatan ng aming mother",,,

abusive She d starve me for her amusement and laugh with her friends when I d eat like I didn t know when my next meal would be she might ve from what I ve heard forced my biological brother to physically abuse and assault me leave me in the care of various men with questionable bad intentions and tell them they could do whatever they wished to me tried to marry me off to various men on thier death beds to try and claim their life inheritance then found out it was more complicated in our state and stopped She would forcibly keep me awake for days on end for not figuring out math problems and made it clear she never wanted a daughter to start with just 3 sons She then ended up resorting to moving practically nowhere and forcing us inside successfully isolating me and my brother from society She also forced us as in my brother and I to go to various therapists psychiatrists to get us diagnosed with autism and when then realized not only we didn t show signs of autism much less that she was the problem shed leave them and go to the next Because of that I got various tips and tricks on how to control my mental and emotional health I should also add that Susan would also poke fun at my panic attacks and behavior around strangers much less men since a majority of therapists and psychologists were male and I was uncomfortable and scared to talk to them However a few of them when I was significantly younger think 7 10 and my mental state clearly didn t match my age due to isolation and such told me I had very very very very bad PTSD and nervously stated that it might never be put in my records However because of Susan poking fun at my symptoms of PTSD and panic attacks I grew significantly better at hiding them think panic attacks looking more like horrible anxiety and nonstop fidgeting stimming The problem lies in the fact I can feel my mental health declining and no one seems to see it or understand Every psychologist I talk to focuses on the PTSD like that s the only issue I have and tell me I don t know what s wrong with me because I insist it isn t PTSD but they won t listen I basically worked on my mental health alone against the world since day one and I even played therapist for Susan and others when I was a child I try to tell them that there has to be something more then just trauma but they insist I m wrong It feels like the me I was is slowly rotting away and I m scared I ll be a shell of my old self It feels like I m wasting away and no one is even attempting to help me I also live with my biological dad I ll call him Steve and his ex girlfriend I ll call her Hannah Steve has made it clear quite quickly I can t trust him with personal stuff and he has a lot of signs of behavioral and personality disorders The one time I told him something personal he threw it in my face during an argument and basically made it sound like it was my fault and I was constantly the problem And even though I want Hannah to adopt me I feel similarly to her She s comforting to be around but if I mention anything about my mental health she just states that I have to leave my trauma in the past I don t even have to be talking about my trauma and yet she always pulls it up It constantly feels like she s throwing it in my face especially since when I escaped Susan s house I ended up in an abusive relationship with my ex and having a child she s now raising and adopting it s something we have talked about and will benefit everyone On the rare occasion she even mentions my trauma with my ex and laughs about it like it should be a funny joke I just feel too exhausted for my age I know certain disorders and such were thrown around when I was a child like depression and anxiety but I don t know what to do I just recently got my first job that s a completely different unrelated thing and I m already uncomfortably close to being fired I constantly feel on the verge of collapse and have intense headaches And it s not just me getting over being sick because when I was around 15 I had the same symptoms I feel horrible I m constantly in pain and I don t know what I should do Hannah and Steve think it s just trauma and I should power through it like them but I don t feel like I have the energy to do that anymore I barely have the energy for personal hygiene and cleaning my room and I feel like I ve been fighting against the world too long I m not suicidal anymore but I m just too tired I don t want to die but hygiene eating and even going to the bathroom feels like a chore I m just unsure what to do or how I should go about things I feel horrible all the time and I don t know how to get it to stop I m constantly on the verge of tears crying myself to sleep Is there something I should do Am I wording things in a way that isn t understandable or am I going crazy I don t feel like I just have PTSD it feels like there s something worsening under the surface everyone ignores once they here PTSD but am I just following in Susan s footsteps I keep getting told I am by Hannah if I mention my mental emotional health issues",22,Female,

text body: So this is the first time i post on reddit and honestly i am quite nervous my family is a bit weird sometimes controlling sometimes i am the scapegoat and my feelings don t matter a lot of the time but i love my family they are not bad people but does that mean i need to cave to a lot of their requests Ok Some context although that s hard because i don t even know what i want to say i just want someone to listen ig I was born and still live in a 3rd world country english is my 2nd language btw the economy is trashed especially after the pandemic but we were never struggling not much anyway we are upper middle class hell we could be considered lower upper class My parents are loving and supportive i have a younger sister that i love but that doesn t mean everything is fine with the world Again i don t know where i am going with this i am just searching for something ig When i was young i was aggressive i picked fights left and right since preschool but then something happened my parents took me to a behavior correction facility and it broke me i would be punished hard for everything i did wrong even though i was just a child they once told me that i am too problematic and will be taken to a work camp in the desert where i would work and contact my parents only twice a week i still rememberthe look on my parents faces they were shocked and sympathetic towards me but they trusted the professionals and kept quiet i balled my eyes out and kept apologizing till my voice dissapeared to my parents credit we never went back there but the damage was done i became quite after that i was still in my first years in middle school and got bullied hard my self esteem broke and since i was a trouble maker before no one would believe i was suddenly the victim and i was labeled a fake victim Surviving middle school was hard and i couldn t even fight back i decided then that i would never let my parents know about anything that happens in school fearing that they would do something again something weird happened to me i was so afraid of fighting and getting into trouble that even if i was bullied and hit I wouldn t hit back it felt like there was invisible strings holding me back the fear of the facility lingered in my mind I had no friends and i was being bullied and couldn t fight back and no teacher believed me i did something i still don t know how i did it i became friends with my biggest bully he would hit me and i acted like his lackey until we were in this weird symbiotic relationship where i would run him errands in exchange for protection from him bullying became less frequent after that To this day i never overcame the facility s fear to this day the invisible strings are still attached i am in my mid twenties right now years passed more than a decade but i still feel weak if only that were all my problems Growing up i found comforts in computers i wasn t a genius or anything but it beat dealing with humans every day of the week i would play simple games mess with the settings and read some forums online Needless to say i became introverted never had a girlfriend or even got close to a female and i only started to have friends in highschool when i switched schools But i faced a bigger delima what did i want to do when i grew up I had no idea i hated studying with a passion but i was smart enough to read over things once and half pay attention in class and get b on an exam it was enough for me but not enough for my family they wanted me to be better tried to force me to study punished me when i would try to get out of it but the knowledge wouldn t go into my head I choose the most convenient major which was cybersecurity i know its weird but without getting into details it was the best option and i did like computers and videos games my parents wanted me to find my passion but that was too tall of an order for me Throughout the years my parents were controlling somewhat and tried to micro manage multiple parts of my life including the time they tried to make me go back to therapy My mother came to me one day and told me that she is unhappy and wanted to try therapy i believed her since me and my mother would ALWAYS fight on everything she always wanted things her way and all i wanted was to be left alone to rot in front of my laptop she told me that she wanted me to attend i said no firmly but she wouldn t have it she kept insisting i told her i would drive her and wait for her but i won t take a step into that office It wasn t good enough for her she insisted on me joining My mother started begging and gave a couple crocodile tears only then i caved in i hate making my mom angry i don t want her to be sad so we went to the therapist not knowing it was a trap When we entered the office i was on the phone she yelled and made me hang up even though she knew that it was work not wanting to make a scene i put my phone away and was handed a folder and before i could ask what was it for i was told to fill in my personal information a fire was ignited in me i slowly turned my head to my mother for a split second she looked away then glared at me the therapy session was not for her but for me she wanted to get me admitted like all those years ago I almost tore the folder but my mom gripped my hand hard warning me not to do anything stupid i was so angry i was ready to burn the whole place into the f_cking ground but i didn t the invisible strings were back they held on a tight leach and so i slowly filled the forms and a little while later we entered The therapist took one look at me and was like he is not here by choice i was silent on the outside but my body contained the rage of a thousand suns the therapist started with my mother while i sat there holding my venomous tongue and clutching my hands What is the purpose of your visit The therapist asked my son is introverted and refuses to get help I want him to be better He has no friends and spends his day off in bed all day He has no passion or ambition not even a dream he looks down on himself and lacks self confidence and so on what the therapist said after would make my whole week the problem is with you the therapist told my mother i looked at him shocked was someone finally taking my side All my life i was told that the problem is with me when i tried to say that she was controlling people told me that she just wants what s best for me and knows better even my friends when i rold them about my arguments with my mon they would be like that s just how parents are i was going insane i almost believed that i was the problem My mother was stunned for less than a split second then she nods knowingly as if she already suspected YOU want him to be better YOU want him to get out of the house more YOU want him to get help YOU want him to have a dream but does he When he came in he was mad being forced to come here but it sounds like he is managing his life at his own pace he goes to work and have lazy weekends He calls his friends on discord and play video games that s totally normal The therapist said i was ready to grovel and thank him for understanding To my mom s credit she looked like she knew that she was controlling somewhat although that didn t mean that i was fine years of emotional neglected and shutting the outside world out left me in shambles I went back to therapist alone desperate for someone to listen to me and understand me a couple of sessions later i got diagnosed with depression add and slight autism I told the therapist everything how they would blame me for getting sick how they would tell me i am faking it telling me i am just searching for a day off because i am lazy i almost cried every session I told him about me about the correction facility about the strings about not being able to emotionally connect very well about the crushing loneliness that i feel all the time about the hallucinations To explain i don t have hallucinations i just call them that i feel infuriated easily but can t act on it so i would imagine what i would do to escape or triumph over the situation i imaging beating everyone in sight trashing the place or even standing and shouting to the top of my lungs and harm myself just to prove a point that i am hurting that i am in real pain I always wondered what would happen if i just stood up one day and st b myself would they care Would it matter A year passed since i returned to therapy and i was seeing progress but not so much we searched for my passion but to no avail we tried to get me to study but not much changed i am lacking motivation and depression prevents me from getting out of bed i am tired mentally and don t know what to do",25,,

text body: My pop passed away back in December and my mom is moving back to California with my niece and two nephews She also plans on giving the kids back to my sister so wants us to move in together I promised everyone I would move with them but the logistics get scarier every day Most apartments the cheaper ones won t let me move without having a job I ll only be able to transfer one job and that isn t a guarantee My mom did find one apartment but it is 3000 a month not including rent and I m not sure my sister will be able to cover her half And honestly I don t know if I ll be able to cover my half the first month since I won t be able to move until a month after so that means coming up with 2 739 for the month of June On top of that it ll cost me at least another 1000 just to get from Utah to California I love my family so much and I really want to be there for them I just don t think I have the money to do it I know they ll accept it if I walk away I just wish I never made any of these promises in the first place",,,

text body: My sisters have been in a long term silent feud and it s tearing our family apart especially now that it s affecting birthdays baptisms and our ability to celebrate as a full family Years ago my older sister J briefly dated a guy for a few months After they broke up my younger sister S started dating him They ve now been together for about 7 years they live together and they have a daughter who is deeply loved by our whole family Back when S and the guy got together J was in a rough place partying drinking acting out Their relationship was already strained and it completely broke down But a lot has changed since then J has gotten sober rebuilt her life and repaired her relationship with the rest of the family She s not asking for closeness with S we want her to be included and to exist peacefully in shared family spaces Despite this S refuses to be anywhere J is She will not attend any gathering no matter how big or important if J is going to be there And she won t bring her daughter either We do get to see our niece in group settings when J isn t there so it s not like she s withholding her entirely But every event becomes a stressful balancing act If J comes S won t If S comes her unspoken rule is that J must be excluded And it s forcing the rest of us to constantly choose who gets to be included and who gets left out This has now become a serious issue My brother has a baby now and we ve got important events coming up a first birthday a baptism extended family flying in from out of town this summer Everyone wants to come But we re stuck Who do we invite If we invite both sisters only one will show My parents are refusing to host anything unless both will attend which has frozen our ability to celebrate as a family We re all stuck in the middle of a standoff that s lasted for years I love both of my sisters and I don t want to take sides But the emotional toll of this is hitting me hard It s giving me anxiety and insomnia I feel like I m constantly tiptoeing through every plan every visit every gathering just trying to keep things from falling apart And honestly it s exhausting These past holidays we got J no S and no niece It was heartbreaking Has anyone been through a situation like this What do you do when one person s refusal to even be in the same space holds the rest of the family hostage Is it okay to stop waiting for full reconciliation and start building something functional knowing someone might opt out How do you choose which sister to invite to family events",,,sibling

author: oofwoofyikes
text body: Hello So I recently removed myself from my family as of January 2024 Long story short my father is a racist homophobic fascist and wouldn t accept my relationship and I can t bring myself to stick around someone who doesn t support my happiness due to their hatred and my mother has been abusing pain pills since I was 15 and between the addiction and mental health issues she had underlying I was over being abused by her My sister 28F who also uses pain pills had been in car accident in 2018 and messed up her leg which is why she started but also I presume shared mutual habit of her and my mother and I 25F had a falling out shortly after that year as she kept trying to get me to reconnect with my parents and I had asked her to please respect my boundaries and stop asking for that She had freaked out on me and ended up blocking me for doing so before I could even respond really In September she had reached out and apologized and she has been pretty okay with boundaries regarding my parents since However in the time that we were not speaking she had met a man at work for context she is a stripper and has been for years even before the car accident was told to stop dancing by doctors bc knee would get worse and it has who was here from Russia on a work visa My sister had told me that they fell for each other very quickly and even through the language barrier he was treating her better than she had ever been treated In what she was describing of him it seemed like he just wasn t abusing her which had happened in a lot of relationships in the past so while I was happy that hadn t been happening I wasn t impressed by him yet Anyways by August they were married Everything seemed to be going okay from what I was hearing up until about a month ago Now from the brief 2 times that I had been around him I wasn t fond of her new husband but I thought I could just be being protective and this random man who my sister didn t know 6 months ago is now legally attached to her And I also must add in here that my sister and I are very spiritual people not religiously but when it comes to the universe and divinity and the law of attraction astrology and numerology and things like that we re pretty involved I find it interesting and practice when I can however my sister lets a coin flip make most of her decisions saying her spirit guides control the coin It s a little trivial but she swears by it and I ve just kind of been like oh okay cool While I do believe in clairvoyance and clairsentience and things of that matter and even having spiritual visions come to you my sister has pushed it as far as her spiritual downloads telling her she is the reincarnation of both Beethoven and after him Kurt Cobain and now herself Okay so my concern now is my most recent conversation with her She came over my apartment on my lunch break I work from home and I had known already that things with her new husband have been a little off lately through a previous FaceTime call but she couldn t give me details because he was there But immediately when I asked what was going on she said well I m the terminator and he s gonna have to go down because I won t let him ruin the world I asked okay I m a little confused can you explain And she had said that she thought her spiritual downloads when she had met this man was to marry him so that he would be saved from the war that is coming between his country and ours but now knows through her downloads that he was actually pre determined to be a dictator in the war and that she has to stay married to him in order to keep him from going back to make sure he doesn t lead to the demise of the earth as we know it essentially Had gone into politics a little there and said that her husbands astrology matched what would be a stronger dictator than Putin idk if I m gonna get flagged for every saying all of this it makes me kind of nervous Anyways I redirected and asked her about his issues with her job something she had mentioned on the phone prior He now has an issue with her stripping accuses her of being unfaithful which is red flag to me anyways because he knew what she did for work when they met He also has an issue with her and her pain pills and personally I agree with him on this as I really do not like that she takes them But she is taking it as an attack because she is much more functioning than our mother and refuses to admit that she is still an addict whether she s better than our mother or not Regardless he is suddenly very disproving of her life overall and she said the more English he understands and the more Russian she understands the less they understand each other I asked her if she has talked to her therapist about this and she said she doesn t speak to her therapist about her husband because she does therapy virtually and she is nervous he will hear her talking about him since he now understands more of what she is saying And yes I confirmed with her multiple times that she does not feel like he is a danger or threat to her physically To me it sounds like she s realizing she may have made a mistake rushing into this marriage for whatever reason and putting this narrative on it is helping her push off accountability for that mistake I had told my boyfriend about her downloads regarding his dictatorship and he brought up that while it s kind of funny it s also really scary that she believes this Like bordering possible schizophrenia She has told me before she will spend days awake at a time because that sleep schedule works for her and on her third day of being awake she gets most of her downloads But my boyfriend had said this really is an estranged thought of her to have and it might be smart to notify someone about this I don t know WHAT to do honestly or who to notify Whenever I go against anything she says even in an opinion way she gets super defensive still I feel like that was a lot so thank you for getting to the end if you did and I can answer any questions for anything that I may not have made clear",25,Female,sister

text body: I m a very introverted conservative person and met my partner on a dating website 15 years ago It takes me quite a while to feel comfortable with people I don t know and I never really felt comfortable around his parents until the last 3 4 years His father is very much into football going down to the pub with his mates etc and doesn t hold back his thoughts His family are all slim the women all very slender with slim hips I on the other hand am short and curvy with a notably curvy bottom For about 10 years his father randomly calls me Nicol arse Just when I feel we re all starting to get along this pops out When he says this I don t respond and I haven t confronted him as I don t think he ll ever change or he ll just think of another name it s the kind of person he is I also spend quite a lot of time in my own world and can appear quite slow he also takes the opportunity to poke fun at this usually when other people are around I think to show off or get a laugh from others I don t think he realises I m fully aware of what he s doing or it could be he doesn t mean any harm by it but it s starting to really piss me off and I feel quite hurt by it I m not very quick witted to think of something on the spot I m initially hurt then mull over this and just feel anger We spend quite a few holidays together with his parents as they have kindly helped out with childcare so my partner and I can have some time together I ve really appreciated this We ve just returned from a holiday together and on the last night he kindly paid for dinner for us all However I took a little while to choose a drink and very loudly in front of everyone said Nicol arse have you made your mind up I just don t know what to do I have told my partner but he won t confront him He has told him that I don t like him kissing me loudly near my ear as it s painful and now he purposely plants a very loud kiss right on my ear which has caused temporary hearing loss So saying something will probably just worsen it Any advice on how to approach this My son is also at an age where he may start to pick up on name calling and I want to ensure I m a good role model for him This is a very awkward situation Let me know if you want help refining the tone or turning this into something you could use in a conversation or letter",,,

text body: I ll try to keep this as short as possible My husband 36M and I 34F have been married for almost seven years His brother s wife let s call her Kylie has never liked me and I don t know why I ve done nothing but try and be kind but she clearly dislikes the both of us To give you an idea of what the past few years have been like She announced her pregnancy to the family the week we got engaged yet I wasn t supposed to be told because I wasn t family husband then fiance said f k that told me anyway and I just didn t say anything When I was allowed to know I expressed my excitement and offered to babysit She told me I would never be allowed to babysit as I have no qualifications for watching children despite the fact I m a teacher She informed me the whole family thought him marrying me was a mistake because we met on eharmony and had only been dating a year before we got engaged I m banned from taking pictures with my niece and anytime I m with her she watches me like a hawk as if I m a corrupting influence or might hurt her My husband s sister 31F let s call her Amanda and I were close for a while but she has gotten more and more distant since getting married last year Side note She met her husband on Bumble but that was perfectly acceptable apparently I was a bridesmaid went to the bridal shower and bachelorette party and we used to hang out now and then She and Kylie have always been closer but Kylie and the brother have been together on and off since high school so I always assumed it was because they ve known each other longer Amanda recently announced her own pregnancy Despite the fact my husband and I have been struggling to conceive for five years and are currently going through IVF we expressed nothing but joy for her news Yet she has decreed that we are devastated and resentful Of course it hurts hearing yet another couple has been successful where we haven t but that doesn t mean we aren t happy for her nor would we ever wish our struggle on someone else I have spoken with her many times long before her marriage and pregnancy that it is difficult juggling the excitement for another and your own pain envy but we agreed both emotions are valid and can be felt simultaneously At this point I m well versed in that juggle as almost all of my friends and at least one coworker each year has been pregnant in the years we have been trying The night before I went in for the blood test to see if our transfer worked Amanda sent out her gender reveal invitation I immediately RSVP d with the comment so excited Unfortunately our transfer was unsuccessful I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say it would have been more cruel to send the invite after we got that news but it s hard to understand why that was the time to send that out And yes even though she never reached out she knew we would find out the next day Neither of them reached out to check on me or my husband once we got the news which also hurt but again trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as I know most people just don t know what to say Saturday was our niece s birthday party Through miscommunication we were late arriving but still in the window of the party time No one acknowledged our arrival except my husband s parents and Amanda did not speak to or look at us the entirety of the time we were there If his mom asked us a question to bring us into the conversation the topic was immediately changed While we managed to engage my brothers in law in some conversation it was abundantly clear our presence was unwanted After eating Kylie and Amanda took my niece to another area far away from us They loudly discussed all the times they hang out together we ve never been invited and started talking about Easter plans again we hadn t been invited While we do not actively attend church nor are we religious we always celebrate the big holidays out of respect so the lack of invitation was purposeful Frustrated and uncomfortable my husband wanted to leave as soon as possible so we took my niece inside to give her presents As she was opening her card Kylie rushed in and immediately tried to usher her back outside Luckily our niece was more invested in opening her gifts and refused The moment she was done however Kylie hurried her outside I apologized for being late saying we spoke to her husband the night before and got a different time than the invitation She said You got the invitation and it clearly said 1 We went to leave and the only ones the say goodbye were his parents and our niece Everyone else ignored us This is only the most recent fraction of the story but the general theme is the same My husband has been ready to cut them off for awhile but I keep trying to engage because I think family is important He s also dealt with some mental health struggles related to body image and our struggle with infertility and I hoped his family would be a source of comfort and support I wrote up long texts to Amanda and his brother but left them unsent because I feel like there s no point I don t see them admitting any guilt or apologizing nor do I feel like anything I can do will change their behavior Do I try to make things right or just give up",34,Female,sister-in-law

text body: This is a very long story but I will try to keep it to the point I really just want to get this off my chest About 8 months ago my f28 husband m29 received a Facebook message from my husbands brothers m32 BIL let s call him Dave Dave says in the message that my husbands brother let s call him Luke SA d his daughter when she was 15 and 16 When my husband confronts his brother he doesn t confirm or deny the allegations and only says he cannot talk about it over the phone We live interstate and talking face to face isn t an option The only things he tells us is the horrible things BIL SIL are doing to him For a time we weren t sure what to believe but Dave s wife hadn t left him despite the allegations and the niece who had been SA d grandparents were also still in constant contact with Luke We assumed if they thought something had happened surely they wouldn t still be in contact with him There had also been no contact from the police despite BIL saying he had gone to the police I had told my husband I would never not believe a girl child s or women s story if they told me this happened to her but as this was his brother he was a little less hesitant to lean all in on the allegations Flash forward to last week we found a Facebook post from the niece claiming Luke s wife and the girls Nan had been telling people it was consensual and not denying that he had SA d his niece Despite them not being blood related he had been in this little girls life since she was a baby and 15 is not old enough to consent This is assault and paedophelia I m feeling betrayed as this man is also an uncle to my daughters I m terrified to think someone who before this I would have explicitly trusted with my children could do such an awful thing Am I crazy for wanting to wrap my girls up in a bubble and never let them leave me I never want to let anyone stay in my home again Am I insane for kinda being mad at my husband just because he is related to his brother I don t want to be associated with this man in any way shape or form How are his wife and the girls nan taking his side I m just so confused my head is a mess and I don t know how to process anything I want to hug the niece and tell her everything is okay and I do believe her but I don t want to drag myself further into this Has anyone else lived this How do you trust the world again",28,Female,Wife

text body: Long story short my aunt is one of the worst people I will ever know in my life She drives drunk has admitted to emotionally abusing me as a child those types of things She is actually mentally ill and most people around her do not realize this She hides her weird thoughts until she gets paranoid enough to say them for example her saying her surgeon was out to get her because the surgeon said she needed to stop eating certain foods after having surgery on her digestive tract What s funny is she is not aware that I know very specific things she s done in her life 1 About a year before I was born my Uncle passed away from epilepsy his heart stopped during a seizure in an elevator and he was revived but brain dead he had struggled with his epilepsy for over 6 years at this point My Uncle left behind his ex wife and his 2 year old son my cousin who were both living 400 miles away from him at the time My Uncle s ex wife had known him about 3 years at this point After my Uncle died my Aunt went crazy She accused my Uncle s ex wife of murdering him My aunt somehow thought she killed him through poisoning from 400 miles away What is hilarious is my aunt still thinks my Uncle s ex wife and her are friends even after this happened 2 She had sex with her best friends husband boyfriend at the time and her best friend still does not know My aunt and her best friend have been friends for over 25 years and years into that friendship my aunt and her best friends husband hooked up while drunk agreed to never tell her friend 3 While drunk my aunt admitted to doing meth we had since speculated that she had been doing meth with her biological family my aunt is only related to us via adoption",,,niece/nephew

text body: Recently it was my birthday so my dad took me out for lunch to celebrate My parents are divorced so we have to plan separately when to celebrate my birthday and decided to do it on a sunday because it just worked out the best for both parties Anyways me and my dad have never really had a good relationship but i ve still tried to keep him in my life bcs at the end of the day that s my dad He just really annoyed me the whole time his fiance too they talk in a baby voice to each other and it just really pisses me off They don t really know me because we only see each other at most 2x a month so they let me pick out my own gift I chose to go to barnes and nobles because that s the only store that carries K pop albums I m really ashamed for liking K pop just because I find it embarrassing so I chose an album that didn t give off the k pop vibe It was V s layover album my dad asked what it was and I said it s like jazz He couldn t accept that answer so then he started to look at the tag and saw it said K pop He made me feel like really dumb and it felt like he was screaming from the top of his lungs that I like k pop Before that he asked to hear the song too so I played Love Me Again and he said that sounds like k pop with a huge ass grin on his face Already being irritated and ashamed I told him Shut the fuck up omg fucking stop already I didn t yell it I whispered it to him I get it that parents like embarrassing their kids and egging them on but he doesn t know me as a person ykwim I was even more embarrassed because there was a guy in the same section that heard my dad talking about K pop To him it s not the end of the world but to me it is At first he laughed but then he saw his fiance have her bitch ass face and started to act all tough In the end we left and he bought the album for me still asking if I want anything else like no I don t want to share any of my interests with you anymore Anyways we get in the car and he s like Never in my life have you ever cussed at me like that what would make you even want to do that In response I said I apologized and no I don t think it was okay for me to do that but at that time I felt like that was the only way for you to stop Btw me deciding to cut him out of my life isn t just because of this My brothers have cut him out already because of his physical and mental abuse I was just hoping he would change When I was little he use to shame me for my hygiene not shaving my legs and would also try to claim I was annorexic and try to shove food down my throat Additionally even now he tells me about how he wants to self exit bcs my brothers don t see him i m assuming to guilt me to staying with him I have the whole conversation recorded so i m just going to write the transcript DF Dads fiance D my dad and M Me D Are you serious M Yes I m serious D You don t call me you don t come around and you expect me to know that reference to know when i m getting embarrassed M Okay and you

my house D that s what i m doing M Okay go ahead D You make things like like dude M it s not all one sided D Like i m not the one that cussed at their dad M And I admit I was in the wrong i m not saying that it wasn t wrong D You caught me off guard M You cant admit that you tried embarrassing me D I did not try to embarrass you M Yeah you did D Who was laughing M You were You had a little smirk on your face D I m asking you what type of music it is M Yeah and I told you it was jazz i m already embarrassed to like this music because it s not normalized D What embarrassing why is it embarrassing M I was just embarrassed I don t need a reason to be embarrassed D What s embarrassing I m trying to understand you I kept on repeating the same thing and he kept on interrupting me M If you are trying to understand me then why do you keep on interrupting me D Is that music bad M No it s not bad This back and forth keeps on going for 30 more seconds saying it s not normalized oh I don t get it M I was just embarrassed D What s embarrassing about it M You can t read body language DF He can t D I can t M Sigh You just gotta learn I m sorry dad but stuff like that isn t normalized D Why do you buy it Why do you care M I m trying to tell you dad but you can t even let me finish one sentence My speech impediment came out on the last part this only happens when I have to talk to him bcs he causes me to be stressed out a lot M It s just embarrassing and for you to do that infront of kids my age D Do you know that kid M No but i m trying to tell you D Then why do you care M You don t understand how it is to be a teenager now and days Stuff like this isn t normalized I use to get bullied since 1st grade even shopping and buying the stuff I like is a huge step for me and for him to throw me out in the ocean like that felt like I was drowning This repeats for another 2 mintues and then it goes silent for a little bit D I just can t get over the fact that you cussed at me M Well I admitted I was wrong for cussing at you D You broke my heart You broke my heart You broke my hea M Well you know what If you don t want to forgive me then you don t have to i m fine with living the fact that i ve already apologized to you D You broke my heart You never ever talk to me like that Ever M Ok D And what hurts me and breaks my heart is that I was clueless about the whole situation M Ok Silence for like another 8 minutes until he opens his mouth again The whole being embarrassed conversation starts again him asking why and me saying the same thing D Who saying it s not normalized M Omg are you serious It s not what people listen to That means it s not normalized D Obviously you care about what people think M I don t but I can still get embarrassed D No you care what

triggered you M Yeah and you are trying to trigger me even more D No i m not M Yeah you are Repeats 5x M Honeslty dad we are getting no where with this conversation I am just repeating the same points

about I am trying to get you to understand my feelings while trying to understand you but you kept on going back every 5 seconds Silence D You don t call me or text me on my birthday M Yes I call you

text body: I m gonna mention Self Termination thoughts and the threats to and an attempt to revoke my privileges to life by another just a warning I tried to not really be descriptive so hopefully that makes it better I m gonna try to make this short and not share a lot of information really bad at that since I m just here to ask a question while I wait for my next meeting with my therapist about 5 days away Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place this is my first time using reddit made an account not even 5 minutes before starting to write this Background So I just turned 16 and I ve been struggling with a lot recently especially since I m currently in the middle of trying to break out of something that had almost caused me to finally commit self termination thinking it as the only answer I felt I had Now before I did this I had a trip to visit my father and his wife in another state I ve barely known the man till then and only recently had short week long at most visits recently and my moms skewed description of him leading me to not want to be with either parent Now in this month I d felt safe enough to tell them some most of what I had been feeling and dealing with and now were in this legal custody battle situation and I m back with my mom till the court date and thankfully she had improved herself in the 3 month I ended up away so I m not in current danger Now my mom was never physically abusive never hit me but got close many times but my family on her side are very mentally manipulative and she has some other things that have effected me especially since 4 years ago when her boyfriend to this day came in to our life she began using what he though was the way you were supposed to treat a growing boy he had his own problem growing up but has never been violent to his biological daughter He never hit me outside of being intoxicated once or at least I think I have bad memory but things happened I think that s enough I want to emphasize this point that he has never been violent to his biological daughter because I still care for this man and his young daughter as family and don t want to see them split up cause of how strong their relationship is My questions I ll try to make this short Is it ok for a man in your house to use the excuse that he is afraid of the child who is at this point like 8 inches shorter the him half his weight and only started doing jiujitsu on adults a year ago but I guess did a pretty nasty choke as an explanation for threatening to revoke my privileges to life and then on the third time attempting to actually do it I don t know if I would still be here or have ended up in a hospital if I had been in a different position and not have been able put him in a choke immediately All three times he was intoxicated I m struggling with a lot on this because hadn t let myself think about it and just tried to go back to living as a family for 2 ish years Is it morally ok for my Biological Mother to still be in a relationship with this man and admit to not remembering and claiming that the time he actually attempted to revoke my privileges to life even though she was the one to separate us and tell me to leave till she came to get me Not home at 11pm at night on cost were currently separated me and the man at least I m trying not to get to deep and currently I m diving back into my self termination idealization tendencies since I m thinking to much so I m gonna stop here even though I cant remember and didn t ask the question I really wanted to know Sorry it s long I ll try to remember to come back and check on this post but my main method of dealing with emotional stress is disassociation so we ll see Thank you",16,,son

text body: My mother is manipulative and a micro manager She is only with my father for his money My father is now 82 and my mother is now 56 I m a 26 year old man now and for my entire childhood I was emotionally abused I am still massively affected by it I spent my entire childhood scared and withdrawn with no friends and only able to leave the house with them or for school Writing this is one of the hardest things i ve ever done as I have never been able to put into words what she would do It didn t matter what the situation was she could manipulate it so she was a hero saviour victim amazing mother E T C Anything that would benefit her in that situation So despite living in fear nobody could ever see it They all just belittled me and told me my mother was amazing and that I should be more grateful Even if I brought up what she would do I could never put it into words or it was all so small that it seemed like nothing to them Some examples of things she would do Up until the age of 18 she would check on me in the shower bath and insisted on helping me bathe She used to force me to kiss her on the lips and would get hysterical if I didn t She used to accuse me of taking drugs if I even sprayed aftershave she d tell the family I was inhaling it She would make me ask her permission to use aftershave or roll on deodorant that she then stored in her office under lock and key She controlled what I ate down to having the same breakfast for months at a time even though I hated it She would check on me while I was asleep up until 18 When I started having my now wife currently 26F at the time we were both 16 round she would listen outside the door and made me ask her every time I needed a condom She used to lie pathologically about the most random things for example seeing friends behind my father s back making me lie too And telling me my father would hate me and divorce her That she would make it so I never saw him again Silent treatment blowing up in my face financial control she had her time and her days with me which meant even if I had plans I had to spend it with her She would make me out as a really ungrateful waste of space and that she is a wounded victim to make her seem amazing infront of others She would talk about all the stuff she bought on credit cards and get my father to pay off for me to make her seem like an amazing person She would also spend money lavishly on others to boost there opinion of her When my father made me the heir to his will he announced it infront of others She smiled and made out that it was what she wanted then took me aside and said if he dies and that will goes through I will sue you for every penny you get I haven t satisfied him for 26 years for you to get it all This has now been amended in that will she was still entitled to live in the house till she dies rent free and a large sum of money She would admit to me on my own that she only had me to tie my father down She forced my father into having me as he was too old to want another child As a little child she showed me a video of a little boy in an orphanage that needed a home If ever I did anything she didn t like she would drag me to the car and tell me she is going to take me to the orphanage and trade me in for this boy because he will appreciate everything she does If ever I did anything she majorly didn t like she would ban me from any electronic devices for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months Coupled with the fact I wasn t allowed to go out with friends that meant I was completely cut off from the outside world and had no communication with anyone other than school Up until I was 16 whenever we would stay at my grandmothers despite there being multiple other bedrooms she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her no pyjamas When I was 16 I got with my now wife we went to the same school At the start of the relationship even she struggled to see what I was on about My mother welcomed her with open arms would take her shopping she almost crafted herself as a mother to my wife who had lost hers very young My wife fell for this at first She slowly started to see more and more of my mother s true self over time We were massively restricted on time together and were only allowed together when my mother okayed it she would use that as leverage over me when we both started at the same collage we lied about an extra lesson so I could spend a extra bit of time with her during the week my mother the overly critical person she was phoned the collage and got my timetable sent to her Once she cross examined the timetables she flipped on my wife like she would with me She put all sorts of restrictions in place and made my wife out to be the devil even to my wife s family turning some of them against her The time restrictions were massively increased and I was getting harassed and emotionally getting abused to break up with her We put up with this until I turned 18 packed my bags and got in the car and drove off It was the most terrifying experience of my life Feeling sick does not even describe how scared I was to openly defy her for the first time I was forced to leave the majority of my positions behind which she still has in my room 8 years later set up despite my request to receive them My wife s grandparents thankfully took me in till we were on our own feet Over the years I have tried over and over to see or even speak to my father but everything goes through her Over the years his entire family has been estranged from him including my older siblings half siblings on my father s side so I have nobody that can relay a message I desperately want a relationship with my father as he was the only person that gave me the will to stay alive for the first portion of my life Without him been my pillar I would no doubt have kms as a child He is old now and has been manipulated to the point of becoming a weak old man that does exactly what she says He no longer has any family only her Whenever I try to reach out he says that he will only see or speak to me with her there I ve written a letter messaged and we had a phone call I am still affected by what she did and know it would massively affect me to even see her face never mind speak to her I know I will regret never seeing my father again when he dies but I am having to put my and my wife s mental health first He is never not by her side but I m desperate Can anyone offer any advice how I can manage this situation nobody not even chat GTP can give me any advice other than to start grieving him Thank you TLDR My mother is an abusive narc and won t let me have a relationship with my dad without her at my wits end on what to do",26,Male,son

author: Anastasia__10
text body: I 13 F am writing this story because I need a mental relief for all the stress I am receiving from my household For context let me start from the beginning but I ll try to keep it short since I can t recap my mom s 18 years of trauma My mom had been married at the ripe age of 19 years and to a man 10 years older than her also my lovely father No it was not forced but arranged and arranged marriages are a custom in our country so nobody really objected My granny AKA my father s mother is the problem here my father is a darling honestly Through my mother s 21 years of marriage 18 years had been spent with that beast Let me tell you some stories ok My mom used to live in Qubar with my father after marriage but because of some financial issues she had to move in with my granny in India and my granny made her life a living hell She would make my mother work while pregnant with me in the kitchen while handling my other two sisters 3F and 8F at the time She would torture my mother mentally with her demeaning words spread lies about her around our relatives and even with maids And because of all this everybody started to look at her with hate Apart from the mental and physical torture she would put poison in the mind of my father through calls and since he was living in another country he would believe her My mother also didn t have a phone and all the money that my father sent from Qubar would be in the hand of my granny so she would make my mother desperate for every rupee She also wouldn t let my mother visit her mother and not even let her talk to any loved ones since my granny was the only one with the phone access In total my mother would be isolated from her lived ones hated by everyone around her and a total shell of a person My father would talk to her time to time but because of my granny they couldn t really bond My mom also started developing psychological issues which she had to take psychiatrist medicines for In total she has diabetes BP psychiatrist spondylitis and asthma And because of my mother s rapid decline in health my father finally noticed something was wrong My father would visit every 3 months only for a week tho and he slowly took notice of my granny s toxic behavior towards my mother keep in mind she would only act half as bad infront of my father Also I was born during this time So my mom says that I was a like ticket to safety for her After I was like 9 10 years old I used to remember my granny and mother shouting and my mother would be crying In one of these fights things got so serious that my granny kicked my mother out at 12 AM of NIGHT I remember sitting in an auto going to my nanna s mother s mother house while my mom was trying to hold it together When my father heard about this he didn t belive my mom and this was sweeped under the rug My mom s breaking point was when my granny cursed my middle sister 13 F at the time for hiding or rather taking batteries from her TV remote and putting them in our TV remote And my granny s exact words were May god destroy her life May she die Me and my middle sister were kinda mischievous in our childhood and my granny would not even give us 5 rupees to buy some snacks from the shop That s why when our TV remotes battery was finished my sister secretly took hers without asking And the cherry on top was my father heard her cursing on the phone he was supportive of my mother but this finally confirmed his suspicions And my darling mother who frankly doesn t have a back bone finally stood up for herself after 18 years of torture and that too for her kids She demanded a separate home and my father happily gave her one And this is the home we have been peacefully living in for the past 3 years But recently their has been some health issues my granny And the health issues aree constipation I mean who doesn t have constipation when they re 85 years old But no she acts like she s dying which I don t understand why she isn t That is why recently she came in our home and lived with us since she isn t healthy and is feeling lonely She was supposed to live for one week but she extended her stay for one more week And now she is requesting to my father to let her stay beside our apartment Keep in mind she is obsessed with TV and is also kinda deaf And my father agreed My mom has been facing PTSD with her living in or home but being the good wife she is she still takes care of her to a T Even after all the treacherous things my granny has done And the thought of my granny living with us permanently is having a lot of effect on my mother mentally Even after telling my father this he insists on letting her live beside us he isn t even listening After 3 months my father will retire permanently he now has a high paying job in Saudia Arabia and will come back to live with us He says he will take care of her but those are just empty promises So what should we do What is the solution to this mess How can my father fulfil his duty to his mother while being a good husband How can my mother live peacefully with her around My mother has given up since we can t find a solution Do you guy s have one TL DR my mentally and physically abusive granny abused my mother mentally for 18 years causing her diabetes BP asthma spondylitis and physiatrist issues and cursed my middle sister that she should die and that her life should be destroyed for taking her TV remote batteries which caused my mother to take a stand and move out into another apartment but now after 3 years my granny is demanding to move beside our apartment because she has constipation feels like she is gonna die soon and feels lonely my father is gonna retire permanently in 3 months so we still have 3 months before she moves beside us Can anyone give us a solution to this problem How can we stop her from coming beside us permanently Because my father bent up on his decision",13,Female,daughter

text body: TLDR Sister is extremely selfish expects everyone to drop everything for her and her family Ongoing fights with no resolution Ok this is going to be long one so buckle up If you manage to get through this whole post thank you I am 30F and my sister is 33F I moved back home with my mum after I found out I was pregnant and couldn t afford a rental my partner and I tried for months but it s just too competitive We pay board and for groceries and all baby items My mum owns a 3 bedroom house and when I moved back in she said I could use two of the bedrooms one for me and my partner and the spare room for my daughters things such as drawers to put clothes in and eventually use it as her bedroom once she is old enough I feel comfortable with her being in a seperate room The bedrooms are very small so we don t have too much space the biggest room is my mums which is the master with a small walk in wardrobe and an ensuite this is important later My sister is married and has 3 children all 3 have adhd This is also important later Last year she cheated on her husband and ended up coming to stay with us for a little over a month with her 3 kids She ended up taking over the spare room so I had to move all of my daughters things to the garage even though I was due to give birth in 6 weeks time During her stay she didn t contribute financially she made a mess as did her children and she refused to clean up after herself or her children I m talking dirty nappies EVERYWHERE not even in a bag just on the floor dirty tissues fast food rubbish dirty dishes empty drink cans etc My mum would come home from work and run around cleaning everything instead of telling her to pull her weight mum would complain to me about her almost on a daily basis though All of her children are medicated and during the stay she refused to give the medication because and I quote I cbf even when her eldest child was having mega melt downs and begging her for the medication While she tells her kids to stfu if they are having a melt down or even if they re happy and laughing I don t want to hear them at all On a few of the days she was here the kids were in their iPads for 12 hours straight Which she usually just shoves their iPads in front of them won t encourage them to play outside won t do any activities with them etc So my mum and I ended up having to do a lot with the kids which is fine but it got exhausting especially while my sister would just lounge about all day and sleep She eventually went home but says we needed to keep the spare room set up for her incase she wanted to come back She s back with her husband and they are in their own rental etc This is where the issue started because we can t utilise the spare room we ve had to use the living dining area for drawers change table and some of our daughters things and we spend a lot of time in the living room during the day I had an extremely traumatic birth had to have a c section which got infected and had placenta inside causing another infection 5 weeks after birth and had to get two additional surgeries which I have another 6 8 week recovery ATM I can t even lift my daughter as I have a weight restriction I d also like to add that I m a first time mum after several losses so I m extra protective of my child Now my sister is coming over whenever she wants because she wants to see the baby not calling or texting first to see if we re busy or up for a visit I ve said to her that because we re so sleep deprived and I m still recovering we need to get as much rest as possible so please call or text if she s wanting to come see us Mums given her a key so she s been rocking up anytime she wants waking us up and the baby and is super critical of everything we re doing You re burping her wrong You re swaddling her wrong You re feeding her the wrong formula You re not doing enough for her Etc I have 3 kids so I know best We spent some additional time in hospital as my daughter was sick at 2 weeks old and we found out she has cow milk protein allergy so we have to feed her a special formula I couldn t breastfeed despite trying This is something she attacks me about constantly saying the doctors are wrong and she just has colic She comes to the house makes me and my partner feel unwelcome in our own space she treats mum like shit brings over full baskets of washing because she doesn t know how to use a washing machine She refuses to cook for herself or her kids doesn t know how to Refuses to work because she s incapable Tells mum she can t spend time with her friends or boyfriend borrows money she never pays back etc Mum just lets this happen and has for years I have another older sister and we have never and would never get away even asking mum to put on a load of washing for us we d probably get laughed at Tonight it got really bad She has come over the last 3 days in a row with her children and husband from like 9am until 9pm I have ASD and I get very overstimulated with lots of noise and loudness etc and she knows this But she was screaming at her children for everything under the sun but mostly for laughing and playing we were teaching them how to play a game on console She wanted us to have all 3 children sleep over and my mum said no and has been saying no for the last few weeks because she s not 100 well and it s too chaotic when they aren t medicated They also insist on sleeping in the living room not the room that was set up specifically for them it turns into a huge fight and melt down every time we have tried to get them to sleep in there I also explained to my sister that I am up ever 3 4 hours feeding changing nappies etc and I have to use the living room to do so so her kids sleeping in there would be too difficult as they would be woken up etc and it s just not reasonable She complains that she needs a break from her kids when they are in school and daycare 5 days a week the school kids go to before and after school care and she doesn t pick them up from school or daycare until 6pm She isn t working literally lays in bed all day and doesn t do anything around the house Her husband complains to me about it all the time Then she wanted to feed my daughter and I hesitantly agreed because I honestly needed a little break But while she was feeding her she was refusing to burp her until she finished her whole bottle 100ml and I was telling her no you have to burp her several times otherwise she ll vomit She ignored me and said she knows best cos she has 3 kids Her husband decided that he was going to rearrange the house and garden My partner asked if he needed help on several occasions and he either ignored him on a few times or said no Usually my partner does the gardening and mowing every 2 3 weeks but hasn t had the chance due to my surgeries and having to look after our daughter full time So we all stayed inside and watched tv During that time I was using my mums iPad and a text comes through from my sister bitching about me and my partner saying that we weren t helping her husband and I was like wtf Why not just talk to me if there s an issue Mum wasn t home so she didn t reply I tried to speak to her about it and she just blew up and I said I didn t want her to be disrespectful to us in our space and she went on a huge rant saying how we disrespect her and my mum and mum wants her house back etc Then went on to say I m going to end up a single parent and she doesn t think my partner is the one for me etc and was basically attacking every angle she could I did snap back and say a few of the things I listed above Then she said I am a lazy parent and my daughter deserves better She said she sees my partner doing everything for our child which he does do a lot and I had to remind her that I ve just had two additional surgeries I m healing and have a weight restriction and I physically can t lift my daughter My partner picks her up and brings her to me for feeds and takes her to the change table and I ll do the nappy takes her to the bath so I can bath her etc I will say I m super grateful for my partner being so supportive and helpful She also said this is not our house and we are just guests so only mum can tell her to call or message before she comes etc I ve set other boundaries in place regarding my daughter such as not kissing her I m not a kissy person and it s a risk with young children from what I ve been told And my sister will refer to my daughter as her baby and kiss her 20 times in the space of 5 minutes I have addressed it so many times with her among other things and I said if she can t stick to my boundaries and rules with my daughter then she needs to back off She eventually left and it was just a shit show My mum came home after a while and I explained to her everything that had happened Mum isn t one who wants to get involved which I totally understand I hate fighting and conflict myself so I always try to communicate and diffuse any crappy situation but my sister made it impossible this time because she continued to message me when she was at home and just was awful to me I m not sure what to do because I don t think she s capable of changing She has always been extremely self absorbed and any time she is told no by any of us she says she s depressed and if we don t do what she wants she ll kill herself _ Mum doesn t see this as an issue and takes her seriously every time she says it but she says it to everything Even if mum says she can t talk long because she has a meeting or she can t see her today because if xyz that s her go to I don t want to feel uncomfortable in my own living space and I am desperately looking to find another living arrangement with my partner and daughter To the point that we have services helping us look into crisis housing because of other things going on in the home family I m not really sure what I m hoping for posting this but I really needed to get it off my chest Thank you if you got this far and sorry it s so long",30,Female,sister

text body: for some background here i 18F was adopted when i was 12 by my paternal grandfather and step grandmother they raised me and my little brother 16M since i was 7 and he was 5 when we had got taken from our bio dad but that s a story for another time things were never great but my little brother and i had definitely seen a lot worse fast forward to around the time the adoption was finalized and i was going thru a really hard time mentally ik ur probably thinking i was being bullied or something but school was actually the only thing i looked forward too it was the one place i knew i was liked bc i was farely popular until high school when i became antisocial from being basically kidnapped i was obsessed with losing weight so i wouldn t eat but my adopted mom still always called me f t and told me i needed to cut back for context ive never been f t at the age of 18 im 4 11 with a petite frame and have never been over 130 lbs they liked to call me a wh0re and tell me i was gonna be fast in the bc my mom had me at 16 they cut my hair so that i wouldn t be attractive to not be fast like my mom and was always told growing up that nobody would ever love me this still causes issues in my relationships and friendships i wasn t allowed to have any friends and when i did make any friends my adopted mom would find some reason for me to not hang out with them anymore she legit told me i couldn t be friends with one girl bc her mom was a single mom they would hit us a lot but we kind of just put up with it fast forward to aug 2019 i was in 7th grade and i told my adopted mom i had been feeling very sad lately and didn t know why i didn t know i was depressed or what depression even was bc mental health was never brought up hell the only time they even did anything abt our physical health was the dentist when we needed shots for school or when it was something really serious or what to do to be happy again and she told me i had nothing to be sad about and was exaggerating for attention so i let it drop and that honestly didn t help idk if it made it worse but ik it didn t help nov 2019 i tried taking my life for the first time in my closet with a blade from a box cutter razor i found downstairs months prior and had been using to SH my little brother unfortunately i say unfortunately bc he had to see that and this will forever be etched into his mind not bc i survived im forever grateful my brother stopped me that day walked into the closet and seen me and he ofc went and told i had a quite bit of blood loss but my adopted parents didnt seem bothered enough to even pretend to care my adopted dad shrugged it off as he went outside to smoke a cigarette and my adopted mom ran water over my cut and wrapped it up she made me clean my blood up which im not mad about bc i wouldnt wanna clean sb else blood either idk if they did this just to spite me or what but immediately after i was done cleaning i was told to get in the car we were going to get food so we go get food and she makes us also go to hella different stores and i ended up passing out in majority of those stores from the blood loss i was punished for staying up all night why else was i falling asleep while standing right after abt a week considering my cut was pretty deep and done with an old dusty box cutter razor that hadn t been cleaned don t judge me i wanted to d e the last thing i was worried abt was dried up bl00d it ended up getting infected i ended up having to take antibiotics when it was finally looked at and got told i should ve came in for stitches since it was winter time tho i was able to cover it up with hoodies and long sleeved shirts except for in gym class in my district they make us dress out for gym in middle school to prepare us for highschool so ig sb seen and reported it to the school guidance counselor cus i got an ass whooping from hell when she got home from work that night for letting family business be known to the public we were always told that what happens behind closed doors stays behind closed doors well dec of 2019 i met a senior at the highschool and being in seventh grade i didn t realize how weird it was that a 12th grader wanted to date a 7th grader but i just felt like i was special bc nb else had an older boyfriend just me so anyways he asked me to sneak out with him i had never done that before but being young and immature after awhile of hearing if you loved me you would do it yes being older i now see all the signs and take full responsibility for what happened but i snuck out with him and we went to the park innocent enough but he ended up r ping me on the park bench and when i told my adopted parents the next morning i was called a wh0re and much more i didn t go to school that day bc my adopted dad was taking me to the doctor they never once asked if i was okay or if i was hurt just immediately told me i was lying abt being r ped bc i had gotten pregnant we go to the dr dr confirms im not pregnant and that i have trauma consistent with assault to this day they still haven t asked me who or how or anything they still think im lying before we left the dr i was asked to fill out a mental health questionnaire and the results to that questionnaire deemed me high risk so i got taken to the mental hospital and from dec 2019 to march 2023 i was consecutively in different mental hospitals residentals and group homes and with my occasional law breaking about 6 months out of that time was in a juvenile detention center in march 2023 i ran away from the group home i had ben staying at for almost a year at that point when i moved in with my brother and was kept there the whole time against my will but technically i was on the run til jan 2024 when i got out that house in jan 2024 i was sent to live with my adopted parents once again one thing i didnt add is that i was a living walking breathing nightmare while i was in those treatment facilities anybody who has been in any of the four will tell you it will change who u are ur not looked at as human by the staff they looked at us like paychecks i have so many stories of staff doing more to traumatize us kids than they did to help us but bc my behaviors were so bad they couldn t find anywhere else to take me that s why i had to go back btw but i thought ill be 18 in a year and ik i dont wanna be here a minute longer than i must so i got a job and started saving i bought my first phone that i paid for and kept turned on with my own money everything i owned shoes clothes makeup perfume hygiene products was bought with MY money that I worked really really hard for work was the only time i was able to get away from them until i went back to school to get my GED which was only a week before the incident so anyways work was my safe place i used to come in early and stay late i would call on my days off and ask if i could come in i worked at a burger king so we always had call outs and my managers knew everything that was going on in that house bc i live in a very small town and word gets around and they were never shy to yell or argue in public and if my hours got to high they would just let me sit in the back office so i wouldnt have to be home after about a month of living there her and my little brother got into a really big argument bc he was eating at the table where he normally eats and she for some reason wanted him to eat downstairs i was not home for this i was at work this is just what was told to me by my brother he refused saying he wasn t in the mood to be around people and just wanted to be alone but she wasn t having it she then goes to the kitchen and starts closed fists punching my then 15 year old brother in the face and he never once hit her back but she busted his lip pretty bad to the point that he stayed up for me to come home so he could cry in my bed and talk to me abt it i took pictures and sent them to cps but when they asked him he said he got scared and lied and said he fell after that i couldn t look at her the same so a lot of arguments occurred one night abt a week after that fight with my brother she randomly comes into my room at 2am to ask me if ive stole her phone i asked her why would i buy and pay for my own phone if i was gonna just steal hers i was then told to give her my phone for talking back and said that i was grounded but i refused bc i paid for my phone and told her i will gladly give u my phone if u give me the money i paid for it but that just made her madder so she went and got my adopted dad yes at 2am and they came into my room and yelled at me for like 10 minutes for me to give them my phone and i kept repeating the same thing to them everytime until my adopted dad told me if i didn t give it to him he would beat it out of me so i told him go ahead and do it so he hit me and i wasn t hitting back at first because he is still my biological grandpa at the end of the day but then my adopted mom jumped in so i did start hitting back once i hit back they called the police long story short i got locked up even tho it was self defense it was two people s word against mine i got locked up and was locked up from the end of feb 2024 til may 2024 while i was in detention i obtained my GED and got accepted into esthetician school at an academy abt an hour away the whole time i was locked up i called every chance i could and never got any answer i was found guilty but bc i had behave the whole time i was in the dhome got my GED and got accepted into school i was allowed to leave the dhome on probation because returning back home was obviously not an option this time i was sent to an independent living program which would end up being another traumatic experience that i actually just got out of two weeks ago which brings us to why im thinking abt suing so my DSS worker picks me up from the dhome with all my stuff that was supposed to have been packed i got in the car and saw one bag ik i didn t own a lot since everything i owned i bought with my minimum wage job and still had a phone bill my part of rent and food to buy with those checks but i worked a lot and had made a lot of money so i knew i would have at least 3 bags but when i asked my DSS worker she said that s all she was handed so i was like idk maybe they packed tf out that bag but i get to my brand new apartment and open the bag and find a single a sock a pair of underwear 3 pairs of sweatpants 2 blankets and a fitted sheet no shoes no shirts none of my hygiene stuff none of my other bedding NOTHING so ofc i contact my DSS worker and inform her and i also let her know that my adopted mom should have about 400 that belong to me from my last check at burger king before i got locked up the only way i was allowed to get the job was if i got the money sent to her bank account so my DSS worker tells me she ll talk to them they claimed that s all that was in my room and that they had already given me my last check i wasn t too worried abt the check idk y but i wasnt it got sent out while i was locked up so it like in my head it didn t really exist idk if that makes sense but anyways turns out they let my cousin go in my room while i was locked up and lied to her and told her i said she could go in there and take wtvr she wanted bc my new house wasn t big enough for everything i was still in the dhome and independent living wasnt on the table at that point so she goes in my room and takes practically everything everything in the bag was all she left yeah she even took my underwear and i honestly don t know what happened to the phone i was upset at first but i eventually got over it but im still very upset abt the fact they gave away everything i paid for with my money and everytime i bring it up to them i get called ungrateful bc they gave away a lot of freedom and time and money to take care of me and my little brother and they ve spent more money on me then i did on anything in that room so aita if i sue them to replace everything they gave away",18,Female,adopted daughter

text body: I 36F have always had a rocky relationship with my sister 27F We will call her M From the day she was born chaos has always ensued She didn t have colic or anything like that but cried all the time day to night Night to day My mother who has not always been the most stable this is important for later has NEVER been able to console her She would try everything but still And it seems like they just never connected She loves my sister without a doubt but the bond was never there It was left on me because it was even difficult for my stepfather to deal with Hes just an Ahole again will be prevalent later but they didnt last longer than 10 years ALL through my sister s life she was definitely different and manipulative If I didn t do something she wanted she would threaten to tell my mom or something I would get into trouble because rather than deal with the issue my mother would say just give it to her so she ll shut up She also slept in our mother s bed till she was 14 regardless of her having a boyfriend who also lived with us He would be sent to the couch or spare room because if she didn t get her way yup threats would ensue And they were WILD In any case this would happen when she didn t get her way I paid no mind to it because by this time I was older and just graduated moved in with my boyfriend and was pregnant with my first child I would still take her sometimes as a big sister would One instance I can remember was I brought her to the fair with MY DAD we were sitting at the pizza joint and M was pulling antics to get anything other than pizza I wasn t paying so I told her no she started to get flippy and my father said she may be your sister But she s MY daughter you cannot speak to her that way For the first time I saw shock and heard silence from this child Fast forward a few years later My mother had given in to every whim been to every event And was not the perfect mother but an appeasing one My grandmother was sick dying of cancer My mother gave custody to my sister s dad because he would not let her leave the state with my sister even to take care of her dying mother She was gone for 6 months before my grandmother passed And only staying behind for a few months after to take care of the estate When she returned for the funeral my sister was the most horrible person to her Saying she abandoned her she was glad my grandmother had died Even throwing a fit at the funeral to leave because she was bored Yes a 16 year old who knew better I was appalled and felt horrible for my mother They re relationship became tumultuous at best after that and I stayed cordial because I truly just did not like her as a person I loved her But it s not something I lost sleep over when she didn t call me back or didn t see her for 2 months etc I still tried to have a relationship She was nice enough to let my 15 y o daughter L stay with her for a month while she finished up freshman year when we had to move out of state Awesome I sent my daughter 50 p wk and supplied all her food through a delivery app for her and extras for my sisters household So she wasn t an inconvenience to M And my daughter L would stay with my other sister B for the last month they live in the same community some of her things had been left behind at M s house and I got a very irate phone call threatening to have everything thrown out because she no longer wanted them there Knowing full well I was unable to come and get them as i wasnin another state Our mother who overheard this called my sister and they had a screaming match saying not so kind things to each other and ultimately blocking each other So I had my mom message M s fiance to make him aware of the situation and ensure my daughters things would be safe I called my dad to have the items picked up and he was there within 2 days to get it I continued to carry on my relationship with my sister with her belittling my mom as toxic because she got her fiance involved She doesnt want him to know the real her I supported her decision to not speak to our mother but always insisted she forgave her as it was also a reaction to M s toxicity as well Our mother had apologized and didn t feel it was fair for her cut her off over M s outburst I felt sorry for our mother As M got married and is expecting her own child very soon She wanted to be involved and M just wasn t having it But still remains talking to others instead By pure Manipulation at best and posting on social media negatively about our mother I called her out on it I ve apologized and forgiven where I can in life But I pointed out her toxicity as well Even towards her own niece Now I m cut off too and waved me never meeting her child in my face Fine But then she also took to messenger to tell my kids how much she loves them even if we are not speaking THAT is when I finally lost it Her manipulation of this entire family was done I will NOT have her do that with them as well I called her every name in the book and told her to F OFF and blocked her on everything So we come down to today She s in labor Our mother and I found out through another family member which I think is insane that they know to begin with Because as thos other person is also a mother they still HAVE to be on M s side with all of this when I feel as a family we should band together to make my sister see the error of her terroristic lifestyle but I guess that s just me she will never know how much this is hurting the family But she doesn t care I need advice in what to do I m so lost I don t like having this much animosity towards someone who deserves it and she is also breaking our mothers heart What should I do I hate that I care",36,Female,sister

text body: Hi all I m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I may never agree with my family and they may never agree with me I was raised in a conservative Christian household where image was everything My parents had a toxic marriage but made sure to smile every Sunday in church Mental health wasn t taken seriously I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD that was brushed off as laziness or rebellion Things only got worse from there My mom who has struggled with alcoholism my whole life eventually stole my identity I had to press charges and cut contact My dad is now engaged to a deeply judgmental woman who s made it clear she doesn t like me mostly because I don t live my life exactly the way she does I moved away almost two years ago with my fiancé who is wonderful and supportive and that distance has done wonders for my mental health Over time I ve become a progressive atheist and I feel like my family s tolerance for me has completely eroded I ve always tried to respect their views even when I disagreed But the same grace has never been extended to me Every time I express a thought publicly that doesn t align with their views I get pushback criticism or dogpiled It s exhausting Sometimes I think it would be easier to just fall in line to believe what they believe and avoid all the tension But I can t I don t want to live in an echo chamber of far right extremism even if it would make my life simpler Lately I ve been considering cutting ties with most of them not out of anger but out of self preservation I m tired of being the scapegoat I m tired of walking on eggshells I m tired of feeling like who I am is a problem to be fixed So I guess I m wondering Has anyone here gone low no contact with family for similar reasons Did found or chosen family actually help fill that void Did it bring any peace I d really appreciate hearing from folks who ve been through this Thanks for reading",,,

text body: I will get straight to the point The situation as they grow older becomes worse They are nearly 60 years old and you need to be cautious around them because they create problems out of nowhere that could easily get you in danger Recent example of what Im saying We were about to go for a stroll with my mother it was 8 in the noon Father decided to come as well and he suggested to call for an Uber since he can t drive with an injured arm and go somewhere else all together We agreed Fast forward we were waiting for the taxi to come but the cab was really delayed During this time a couple from the neighbourhood decided it was about time to get rid off of their old mattress So they brought it next to the dumpsters They couldn t lift it to to throw it into the garbage but regardless they left it next to the trash Father saw that immediately got furious and started out of nowhere yelling to the woman and the man to take that away because who s gonna take that They explained to him that it will be taken away blah blah Long story short they had different opinions about the fuckin mattress and where it shall be left at As usual father called this woman a wh re and her husband went mad so he lashed out to my father and he started beating the f out of him I was trying to part them pulling the man off of my father who was knocked out And guess what instead of my mother helping she was hysterically yelling and screaming like she was being killed HELP HELP SOMEONE HELP AHHH She cannot even act in times of danger or emergency and she was begging for someone to come and help while her DAUGHTER was trying to part two big ass men and me being hit as well in the process No one came for help and they were like 20 men in the corner closely watching the drama unfolding I felt so embarrassed and furious but I always manage myself unlike my parents I took them upstairs when everything was over and I had to deal with an overly dramatic shocked unreliable woman and an injured father who always put his family in danger because of his impulsiveness I m 24 I had moved out in the past got kicked from my last job recently and trying to restabilize so I can leave them for good I m really sad that they grow stupider day by day and I had to return back to living with them Quick mention mother is like father too She cannot even protect herself and she instead provokes people on the road to pick up fights becauase this man woman looked at us in a disgusting way I mean why I should even care about such parents Im tired of this specific toxicity and from their other behavioural problems which apparently are being ignorant with no knowledge and completely lost in their own world This leads them to continuously gaslight me when I open up about issues and things they did in the past I m on my limit I feel trapped Ps I have no social life and no friends and now no job I m in my room 24 7 literally Getting out only when everyone s asleep so I can take my daily shower etc I have tried therapy as well but the docs neglected me to the point they told me to get on meds and they fell asleep during my visits I think its better to remove myself completely at this point",24,,daughter

author: Amazing-Visit-795
text body: Hi sorry to everyone this is my first Reddit so I m not sure how this works but I just wanted to ask for some help My question is mainly if I should help their relationship or just mind my business My mom 48 and dad 49 have been been married for almost 27 years and I cant accurately say if their relationship has always been kind of rocky since as kid I never paid attention to it I do know that they argued in private However these past 5 years there relationship has gotten worse especially this past year They have been arguing publicly almost every time they re together And now a couple weeks ago my mom talked to me about how she is thinking about getting a divorce Her reasons for the divorce just the main ones she says not all her husband my dad never listens to what she says asks him to do for example he has one job in the house to do and that is to take the trash out Which he said he will only do it if it s tied up and placed by the front door That doesn t happen a lot it stays tied up by the trash can Side note now that my brother came back home my dad just makes him do everything my mom asks him to do Like the trash Another example Side note my dad is on the bigger side when it comes to weight so my dad eats very unhealthy and my mom wants him to eat healthier and order out fast food since its unhealthy and delivering is expensive so she started ordering those factor meals and we would have those in the fridge but then he would go an order something and she would end up being upset since she said to stop ordering when there is food in the house my mom said he doesn t do anything for her Side note My dads truck is unable to function atm so now we are all rotating vehicles Example she gave my dad would leave the gas tank nearly empty to where its like a one way trip to work and he wouldn t tell her before hand or just fill it up for her She wants him to fill up her car for her she said he doesn t help her with any of the laundry car stuff or cooking doesn t ask her to go out on dates or anything doesn t buy her anything nice anymore he doesn t help her out at work side note they work at the same place but diffrent hrs dad 1st shift mom 2nd my mom said he has no shame doesn t care Sorry this is kinda gross But she said that he jus doesn t clean the toilet seat after he is done using the bathroom and would leave dookie stains or he would pop his butt zits and there would be blood stains on there and he would leave it there and not clean it So she would ask him to do it and he wouldn t and he would call her a sissy Because she said it was gross last main one reason The way he treats her talks to her Example he calls her women from time to and he thinks it s funny so he keeps doing it He tells her to go make him this and that And he doesn t say thank you or please unless she says something My mom said she doesn t deserve to be talked to like that or treated in that way Side note she has stated that she s not happy and that he doesn t make her laugh anymore My dad used to complain to me about my mom and but me and him are not very close at the moment so I don t know how he s feeling right now but what he has said out loud in front of me recently is that all she my mom does is nag him And that he ignores her when she talks for too long I believe my mom has some valid points about my dad since I agree with them but I also know that my mom is not the best at communicating She thinks she says everything she s thinking but she doesn t say everything In the past they would call me out of my room and my dad would ask me if my mom said this or that which would help stop the argument I also know that she wants him to do stuff without being asked read her mind kind of but my dad is not very good at reading the room minds and he is also bad at communicating as well He tends to get louder if his point is not getting across which as some of us who did this I do it unfortunately know that this doesn t work Also as I said they work in the same place and the coworkers that they hang out with inter lap and my mom told all of her female coworkers that know talk to my dad that he doesn t do this or that and all those girls berated my dad and would say their husbands would never treat them like that My mom said she thought by doing that he would hear other peoples opinions and maybe listen to them since he doesn t listen to me But i don t really agree fully with that approach and she does a lot of things like this in the past so idk My personal thoughts for their issues they don t sleep together since he sleeps on a couch since he says laying down on a bed makes it hard to breathe at night they don t COMMUNICATE WELL they don t plan anything to do all they have is work friends like they need to be around other people get a real good friend that they could vent to ask for advice NOT VENTING TO YOUR KIDS Which none of us are even past the age of 27 so we cant give them that much advice I m not sure what to do with everything that I ve heard about their relationship Part of me wants to help them talk it out like maybe convince them to see a marriage counselor or something But I also don t want to get involved anymore since divorce is serious But my mom hasn t been getting any happier so I think the more unhappier she gets the more she will think about divorce Also I m afraid if they do get a divorce my dad will become depress and gain a bunch of weight I know none of my siblings have a good relationship with him and they probably wont go out of their way to see him cal him I m afraid I m in the same boat as them but I probably wont call my mom either tho So she I get involved and help them or stay out of it Sorry if this was too long T T",,,

text body: Hi all I m 29 and I haven t had a real relationship with my dad since I was around 14 15 He was only in my life for maybe 6 7 years total He reached out to me in late 2019 we talked on the phone and texted for a few months and then he just stopped communicating out of nowhere That silence really hurt especially after I let my guard down So when he eventually tried reaching out again I didn t respond I felt like he was doing what he always does showing up then disappearing I had to protect myself so I pulled away I also strongly believe that his wife who doesn t like me or my sister screens and deletes my calls and texts They share a phone and I ve had a gut feeling for a long time that she s interfering with our communication Fast forward to recently he randomly texted me four messages in a row that he was in the hospital and where I ve been because he hadn t heard from me however last time we ve spoke was in 2019 2020 before COVID lock down It completely threw me off I hadn t touched my phone all day and when I finally did his message had come in one minute before I picked it up On top of that just a few weeks ago I actually saw him at the grocery store near me we live only two towns apart but he didn t see me It gave me anxiety I wasn t prepared to see him in person and it wasn t on my terms Now I m left feeling unsettled Part of me wonders if I should respond I ve drafted a message that s firm honest and keeps my emotional boundaries in place It acknowledges that his absence hurt me and that I m not in a place where reconnecting feels right but I also don t want to fully close the door if one day I feel differently I guess my question is am I making the right call by keeping my distance Has anyone been in a similar position with a parent who pops in and out of your life What helped you navigate it I m trying to honor my peace but I also don t want to carry regret Thanks for reading",29,,son

text body: My 24F younger brother 21M has become very misogynistic and racist following his breakup He was dating this walking red flag girl 22 F for about a year and a half She rubbed off pretty much everyone the wrong way but it was his first relationship and he was happy to be with someone out of his league Apparently what happened was she told him she was waiting to have sex until marriage while in reality she was treating him as a backup and hooking up with other guys I don t know what was going on in her head but that s the general idea from what I got Eventually he found out and obviously was really upset confronted her and her response was to break up with him and make fun of him I didn t know until recently but apparently she told a bunch of their friends that she wouldn t have sex with him because he has a microp nis I don t think that s entirely true but it struck a chord with him and became a bit of an obsession for him apparently Fast forward a few months he has become a shut in and is using a lot of redpill lingo about women and minorities Frankly in the beginning I found it somewhat entertaining to refute the made up stuff he would repeat from anonymous accounts on Twitter but it became more and more deranged It all blew up last week when we were home amd he found out I had been on a couple of dates with a black guy He started screaming stuff I will not repeat and then went into his room and was audibly crying That s what prompted me to ask more some friends who are still in school about what is going on with him Our mom has been a little worried about it but doesn t know all the details I think and she is probably more glad he at least broke up with that girl I think he needs a combination of compassion and getting slapped back to reality How do I proceed",24,Female,sister

text body: England 17m Mid Christmas last year I was in my room when my mother started having a go at me for not having a shower or something it was something small and ridiculous I have some chronic skin issues and it wasn t as easy as going straight away She stormed off and started loudly going on about how I was pathetic and how she was going to pull me out of education god knows I went down stairs and yelled back that she was the pathetic one and yada yada while yelling spit came out of my mouth not like a pre meditated spit but instead like flying spittle and she then launched at me for spitting at her She then hit me on the face it was decently hard and did leave a mark that bruised visibly I pushed her off and my dad had a go at me for hitting mum I didn t hit her he then dragged me by the collar of the dressing gown hoodie I was wearing up stairs I just put my arms in the air and said I didn t want to fight He then stormed downstairs I tried to then go downstairs and calm things something my dad admitted later that I did however they were threatening to call the police apparently a bluff and my dad was dialling Not having it I rang the police I was in hysterics and ugly crying a bit the guy over the phone was nice and police arrived my dad kept yelling at me to get off the phone and coming into the room I was in When police got to my house it was two young female officers who split up to take statements or whatever halfway through me trying to say what happened the other one just pulled the one I was talking to out and I never got to give a full side of my story I was then left waiting in the room for ages until another set of police arrived While this was happening the police women were schmoozing with my parents and laughing about our dogs chihuahuas and Christmas stuff When I talked to the new policeman who showed up he did somewhat listen to my side of events but not like to write them down and he immediately afterwards just told me that a domestic report was made still not sure what that means and if it affects me it better not and that I had to go to my grandmothers for the night I then got in the police car with a my dog and went to my grandmothers mainly feeling a little cheapened by what I thought I was getting help for I got my grandmother to check and she even noticed there was a mark on my face the police disregarded it Next day my dad arrived had a go at me didn t listen to me and called me a bullshitter Finally got to school late but when I tried to text my mum to make amends she ghosted me then told me I was gonna stay at my grandmothers and wasn t allowed to come home unless I conceded a bunch of things stressed and suffering from aforementioned skin issues I just gave in Proceeding months council people rang up and apparently my mother blamed my girlfriends outburst in school unrelated on the incident and that it was wholly me hitter her that apparently the police took pictures of a bruise on her neck don t know how I pushed her just repeats of her telling me how the police wanted to arrest me and they saw it as domestic dispute and now holding it over my head in arguments that they ll call the police and it ll be the end of my chance at anything in life I have photos of the very visible bruise that formed days later and yet she even denies hitting me It is ridiculous I m tired of her and my dad holding it over my head and I don t want it forever recorded like this when I don t feel the police even heard me out when I called them Any advice on what to do don t preferably want to tear apart my home just want to not be downtrodden thanks",17,Male,

text body: My mother s brain is noticeably seriously affected by excessive alcohol consumption For example she has memory problems she can call several times a day with the same subject or question When I tell her this it is not true and I am just saying something She also often says things that have not really happened but she believes them herself She neglects herself she does not smell fresh has visible stains on her clothes and is incredibly thin and I suspect that she also eats poorly In short she forgets or ignores all kinds of basic needs She also shows no awareness that she has to adapt to the standards or expectations of different situations which can sometimes lead to inappropriate actions or statements and can cause uncomfortable reactions All these points all fit in with an advanced stage of Korsakov s syndrome Because I feel like I slowly lost my mother a while ago I no longer feel any feelings of affection for her Because of this disease her personality functioning and appearance have changed so much that I no longer recognize her I walked past her at the traffic light and didn t recognize her at first When I did recognize her and spoke to her I immediately noticed that I no longer felt a mother son connection at all I also had the urge to really create a physical distance between us While she was going down with alcohol we tried to help her several times With my mother s cousin among others we sent her to an addiction clinic and then we completely cleaned her entire house which was quite neglected Because she was in the clinic voluntarily and therefore not under duress she quickly left of her own accord She often thought she was better again We did this several times sometimes she really stayed there for a while but then she relapsed again or didn t fully cooperate I don t know if it s because she doesn t recognize her own illness is naive or because she lacks assertiveness But it feels like we offered her help several times and she rejected it Even though it s been a few years since we helped her I don t believe she would ever cooperate 100 I don t really feel like trying anymore At the moment she doesn t have a home She s clearly not capable enough to ever find a home herself or to take care of herself She s currently living with someone who takes care of her not necessarily well but she has a roof over her head The person she s living with is old and unhealthy so that could end at any moment If that happens she ll end up on the street and if she doesn t find shelter somewhere else she ll be a homeless person The idea that your mother s fate is to end up homeless is very painful and that would of course make everyone very sad including me even though I have little to no feelings of affection anymore I actually want her to get help She needs specialized care for example some kind of sheltered housing but I don t want to arrange that anymore Helping her takes too much of my energy and only gives me pain sadness and irritation I want distance from her and would prefer not to have any contact with her anymore",,Male,son

text body: I m in my hometown for my wedding and I just had the worst panic attack I don t even know where to begin I m the middle child between two sisters My elder sister has always been the golden child while I ve often felt overlooked by my parents This panic attack was triggered by something that might seem small but it felt like the last straw I had booked a makeup artist that I was really excited about My sister also wanted to book one and she decided to go with the same artist Due to a sudden date change which wasn t my decision we had to reschedule everything including the makeup artist Unfortunately I didn t rebook in time neither did my sister but for some reason I was the only one blamed when we realized it was too late The makeup artist stopped responding even though she had our deposit For the past two days my younger sister has been trying to get in touch with her Since I have diagnosed anxiety and tend to be very detail oriented I kept asking my younger sister for updates maybe too many times but I was respectful in how I asked I just felt anxious that something important to me was slipping away When I finally expressed that I was upset about my event being affected my elder sister got angry saying it wasn t a big deal She suggested I take the appointment if only one of us could be accommodated I even offered to reimburse her for her makeup but she said she didn t want to go early anyway The problem is she never lets me express any emotions She always dismisses my feelings by comparing them to hers especially since our grandfather passed away during her wedding Anytime I share my stress she turns it into my wedding was worse so you have no right to complain It feels like she has patented emotions and I m not allowed to have any I made a mistake by asking my younger sister about the photographer in front of my family My dad as usual lost his temper and told me to stop bringing it up saying he d rather just pay for another artist than hear me talk about it That hurt me deeply It s not about money I just really wanted this particular artist and now I have no backup My event is tomorrow Maybe I was wrong to ask so much but I wasn t trying to be difficult I just have severe anxiety and I kept asking because I was desperate for reassurance My sister then told me We all try to accommodate you but you re always problematic That broke me I wasn t trying to cause problems I wasn t asking for money back I was just anxious and overwhelmed And when I was alone I had a full blown panic attack I couldn t breathe and I didn t have my medication with me I didn t tell anyone I feel like my parents have always treated my sister like she can do no wrong while I ve spent my whole life feeling diminished by her I feel like I can t say or suggest anything without it going through her first I feel suffocated I came back hoping that for once this weekend would be about me That maybe I could express my stress and feel supported But now I feel completely lost My sister calls me selfish and says I always create problems that I should just put on a fake smile because everyone is here for me But how can I when I feel like I don t even have space to exist",,,middle child

text body: Hello Reddit It is my first time posting in this forum I feel like I need some advice from people who have experience something similar regarding family dynamics and sibling abuse so if you even take the time to read this post I will feel at least some sort of acknowledgement Please note that English is not my first language therefore this post will most definitively have some spelling grammar and expression mistakes Forgive me for this Nonetheless I feel it is important to get this out into the world regardless of how many mistakes I make along the way As the aforementioned paragraph says this post will deal with a lot of unhealthy dynamics within the family and some forms of physical and psychological abuse If these topics are of trigger to you please reframe from keep reading This can hurt you and your mental health comes as a priority in all times Keep yourself safe and take care of yourself My sister 32F and I 26F have always had a complicated dynamic I was born with complications regarding some benign tumour that had to be removed when I was very young still at 2 years old After the operation took place I had several aftereffects such as loss of mobility on the whole left side of my articulations and loss of the ability to walk that had to be dealt with for an extended period of time Amongst these ways of treatment was homed physiotherapy which included activities such as swimming walking playing as much as I could so I can get physical movement around my whole body and try to recover This part is one thing that I learn the day that I spoke to my mum the day that I wanted to speak about the events that I will explain in further paragraphs That my sister had to take most of the initiative into getting me to walk play around and do physical stuff by in most cases taking little pushes from my back so I could get up on my on and walk I m not quite sure if it was something that was meant to be done in favour of my recovery but my mother believed it to be so and doctors explained to her that it was okay for my sister to do such things Apart from this treatment and operation during which period according to my mum my sister expended alone with my grandparents in a household where my grandmother had all the saying and decision making and led to my sister developing unhealthy habits and coping mechanisms for communicating her needs and worries my sister and I were raised equally We were raised in a very grateful and welcoming family that will hear us and be for us in anything we might need or be helped with These following events are a collection of very distanced and blurry recollections of what was happening at those times as well as some not so much detail recollections of what my sister was going through at the time so take these following paragraphs with a whole container of salt When I was mid ages 7 8 I started receiving physical reprimands from my sister for not properly do the chores around the house with her while our parents were out for work near our house on a greenhouse of their own they both were self employed at the time and my dad had to help my mother keep the greenhouse flowers every day especially on Saturdays so If I needed some sense of security from someone I had to physically leave the house and walk to where they were staying there so I wouldn t have to deal with the physical damage and screams from my sister until it was time to get back home Every time these events would happen my parents would talk to my sister on the dinner table at dinner time and say to her what was wrong with that behaviour but it didn t go far from this that they would stand up for me so I opted for keeping going to the greenhouse every time this happened to feel a sense of temporary relief This happened every Saturday morning from the moment my sister woke up 11 am to mid afternoon 2pm when it was time for lunch all together These physical reprimands would be slaps across the cheeks strong enough that I will cry and eventually sooth myself out so cleaning could be dealt with around our home When we were about the ages of 12 me and 18 my sister years old she started these series of jokes which including inappropriately touching my breasts and butt out in front of my family saying things like Lily not real name what a delightful ass you have or you have some soft and big breasts sis while touching my areas I would then react immediately by getting away from her grip saying out loud Stop to her face and begging for my family to do something Again it would end in some verbal light reprimand and it would be forgiven no matter how much env arrased or violated I would feel afterwords This led me into a mindset that forced me into believing for a very long time that family is not someone to hold a grudge against because no matter what they would do to me it was for a reason I was not comfortable with this mindset and I know now that in fact it is not the case at all but it was the mentality that allowed me to survive all the years my sister kept on living with my family and I Through years of self reflection I now know that although I also made many mistakes with getting back to my sister I would learn to respond to her physical abuse with verbal abuse judging her type of mentality and acts like something to reprimand and despise I hurt her a lot because I felt at the time that it was the only way to feel some sense of justice to now realized that I only caused her more pain along the way that she stills battles with I didn t deserve any of that sort of treatment So I tried spending the time that my mind and hart allowed me to to hang out with my sister along with my parents thinking that enough time and thinking had passed since this sort of reactions could have ever repeated themselves nowadays I was wrong My sister visited us by the end of March this year She came to visit after asking for some vacation leave to her workplace now in Switzerland and came to spend some time in our country Spain and our home She was planning on doing a lot of things together while visiting us every day for at least an hour and hang out with our grandmother and grandaunt they now live with my parents since is much safer for them to be around our parents and live more relaxed and cared for On Thursday that week my sister wanted my mother and me to go shopping and spend some time together so we arranged that they would let me know via text when would they be arriving to the entrance of the city I live with my partner since three years ago a 20 minute drive from where my family lives so I could be ready on the road waiting to get in the car together with them so they didn t have to wait a long time for me to get ready The journey started with them not letting me know when they arrived at the entrance of said city Instead they let me know they were at my door and they were waiting Once I get on the car after some time and while we were arriving at the shopping centre my sister started lashing at me about our decision to move our of the family house to be an independent couple living together and that we were wasting money instead of just moving into the empty house in which our grandmother used to live before our granddad died she still goes every afternoon to do chores and watch TV amongst other things I tried to argue that it was something that we were looking forward to doing even if it was economically challenging and that even if it meant not saving as much money as in any other household situation we were really happy about our decision but my sister tried to keep imposing that it was a dumb decision by which point I started saying that If we weren t willing to listen to neither of our opinions that I would prefer to end the conversation They raised their shoulders in disbelieve and said that it would also meant for me to try and listen to their arguments but I was not up to it if it means standing arguments in an imposing and judgemental manner not actually listening to my accounts and taking things from their perspective only I tend to also do that a lot when it means talking matters with my family I am also to blame for that sort of habit with them At some point in the shopping trip we were starting to consider to get back home but not without visiting one last shop This part is still very vivid in my head and body and will be the most descriptive of all We were at this store looking at some accessories for hair and hair claws when some girls intended to come into the shop where we were somewhat crowded and it so happened that they entered by where we were standing so they pass behind us My sister and mum were around me by this point my mum to my left my sister to my right somewhat behind so my sister let the girls in by stepping forward and bumped into my back When this happened I feel her hands holding my ass for far too long of a time saying to almost just us that my ass was very firm My mother was by my side and I went furious on the insides but hold composer due to the crowed of people that surrounded us and that in that moment I didn t want to raise concerns to anyone counting that my mother could have seen or heard all that have happened and that I told my sister at that moment to Stop by saying her name loud and firm while getting away from her grip After some thought on what happened that day and the acknowledgment that the touching happened again so many years later in plain sight out in public I confide into my partner s parents my worries about how my parents could react if I were to tell them what happened and that it was the same behaviour they were aware of years prior to my sister s independency They were very wellcoming aknowledging that of my sister s behaviour throught the years as far from acceptable and that I should talk things through to my parents in order to have their side and from there being able to make a decision as to what sort of relationship I wanted with my sister from now on The conversation took place this last Sunday when I visited to have lunch with my parents and grandmother and grandant alltogether while my partner stayed home due to the conflict of not being able to do anything to remedy the situation but to hear my side of the situation The conversation took place without my grandma and grandaunt present at that moment My mother spoke the whole time they wanted to say their side My dad was silent all the way through and even stepped outside of the house and came back after some moments My mother said that it was really bold and irresponsable for me to implie there was an abuser in our family refering to my sister and her behaviour and that I should be aware of how these acts would other members of the family feel about me accusing my sister of such things I didt n say abuser at any point of the conversation and limit myself to explain about the events of Thursday afternoon and their similarities with what my sister used to do to me in front of them things they were made awared of when I spoke out about them right when they happened That I needed to fix things with my sister if I felt I had a problem with her and that she doesn t understand how could I see those touchings as abuse because all she was able to see was a form of care and affection I don t really know how to react to this sort of mentality regarding abuse and my own experience with my sister I feel denied from all validation from my family I love them but I really don t understand the perspective of taking signs of abuse as affection How can I move past this mentallity I still love my family and love them deeply but it really hurts that they are backing my sister my 32 year old sister on this one I have still an appointment with councelling on June planning on seeing if there are chances of rescheduling for some date earlier than then I don t know what steps to take to solve this barrier without it distroing my integrity with my own sence of self respect I feel like if I just at least have some more aknowledgement it would motivate me enough to keep working on myself and on getting to work my feelings out Right now just hearing about my mum or hearing her speak hurts a lot I know she doesn t have a fault on this and that my sister is a daughter of hers too but it hurst a lot Sorry for such a long post I appreciate your time and dedication you put into hearing and reading this out Thank you for being here and for taking time of your day and energy to read this",26,Female,sister

my boyfriend is wonderful and he always encourages me to do my best He is very selfless when it comes to helping me with anything whether it s offering solutions to daily problems to as far as having me move in with them to improve my mental and emotional help from my parents I have a younger brother who is 19 and my relationship with him I would say is about normal We both attend online school with a tech school with high end tuitions we re not rich had to file for the FASFA We also work part time but i work more than him because his classes are more demanding for time I pay the home electricity and he pays the internet because our mother wanted us to have an understanding of bills which we both already knew because we have our own I graduate in September and turn 21 in a month from now My relationship with my parents I dont think is horrible but definitely could be better My father has PTSD and BPD borderline personality disorder and some other issues who gets easily pissed off In the past when we were younger he was more aggressive and threw things but never harmed any of us When we moved to our current town 7yrs ago with a new scenery and change of pace he gotten better especially with therapy for a few years My mother has a very technical mind where as long as everyone is fed and housed everyone s fine She still has the mindset since she was younger but in the past year or so she s worked on herself to better understand my father and me and my brother Shes not a very emotional or empathetic person but she tries to help in some ways She says I m alot like my father mainly in downing myself and tending to bring up past things and a few other things But I m very emotional understanding and very kind spirited the smallest topic that really bothers me will make me tear up for no reason Onto the point The past 6 months or so has been stressing bc my father didn t want to drive anyone mainly me to and from anymore bc I m not appreciative of him doing so he s been the human taxi since I was young I ve managed to find rides thanks to my coworkers and sometimes my boyfriend when he s able to due to him working fulltime I would hear my parents go back and forth about me and my relationship and my future mainly hearing dad He would say things like how I m throwing everything I ve worked for by being with my boyfriend who doesn t really have a career in mind My bf said he s the type to work whatevers needed and wants us to be long term bc of how well our relationship is compared to our past ones od being used I tokd him it bothers me he has nothing really planned for himself to which he said theres some things he wants to do but takes money like anything else My father would also say how I m selfish for things like still buying crap which I hardly do anymore except for snacks like once a month and a few packs of whatever single Pokemon card packs I see bc that s my hobby and how I proclaim about eventually moving in with my boyfriend s family Me and him finally got into an argument a few weeks ago and let everything out My parents never liked my boyfriend simoly because of how immature he was back in our freshman year of high school WHO ISNT AT THAT AGE And how obsessed he was with his then girlfriend They call him narcissistic and a f boy because of the couple of girls hes been with and the moment he gets intimacy from me he ll leave like most other guys Little do they know I gave my v card to him the mid last year and it s been a year later and we re still amazing I know my folks want the best for me like any other parent who wants their children to succeed My mom religiously tells me to keep saving to get a car obviously used for a first time car and to save for my own place and for me to stay living with them til I m able to do so I told her and my bf I feel like I m on a time limit about the car thing bc what if soon after I graduate I need to drive an hour away or move to a different area for my new career yk My parents proclaim how they re so proud of me and my brother bc of our school successes and keep us on track to do good and keep us from the riffraff bad kids They were more concerned with us doing good in school and having a good childhood that they didn t really teach us anything as we got older They were more supportive of me when I was little than throughout highschool up til now I don t feel supported for making certain decisions My father is really clinging to us because he doesn t have anyone left in his side of the family now after my grandmother passed away in October from cancer that she miraculously survived 4 5yrs after her original diagnosis Like my mother said as he clings more to us I feel he s also pushing us away because of how he s going about it Like I tell my boyfriend and some trusted coworks is that I have more emotional issues with my father than my mother but both seem to not want to understand things from another point of view In the emotional and mental side of things I feel like because of their disinterest of understanding me not only as their daughter but as an adult I feel pushed away from the things my father says as if he has no faith in me From either of them I don t feel respected as an adult in my home simply because it s our house and you will respect us Yes I get that and always have but they don t do the same They say how im wanting to be an adukt but still act like a child and they dint want to deal with it They dint realized that young adults even uo til like 25yrs old still need support and guidance from their parents They say im childish because of who im with and my tendencies to buy pokemon cards and still try to hangout with old friends They blame my boyfriend for how I ve been how much more of an attitude I ve had how I m disrespectful Witnessing and hearing him and his mother argue sometimes or what we talk about tells me more about a better way of resolving things When They argue they eventually apologize and find a solution while my parents grow more distant because of miscommunication That s not me saying my boyfriend s family is better everyone has their own family problems My boyfriend and I have serious talks not arguments about life things what needs to change me needing to move out to have my peace again my driving and license issues etc I know it would be wise and mature to buy my own car and buy or rent my own place but I don t make enough for either after paying the house electricity and my bills I m lucky enough to theoretically make 300 payments for a car but people want more a month or buy it outright in cash neither I can currently do even with 800 saved 200 thanks to my mom I just need to know if I really should move out I originally planned to after graduating and move in with my man but even he says it s getting worse the longer I let it go on I told him other than not having my own vehicle yet and have to worry about getting to and from work bc they live 15mins away while we live 5mins from work the only other thing that s holding me back is that daughter guilt The guilt of the bill I pay for falling on my brother or my mom being in the red after paying it every month or something happening between my parents or if somethings happens in my relationship and I m not welcome back home and hear I told you so by everyone My man re re reassures me that won t happen bc of how healthy our relationship is but I cant help but feel unsure about literally EVERYTHING in my life I m not even fully confident in my career choice and it going anywhere and be stuck

now My sister never got along with our mother She believes that our mother treats her differently from my siblings and I My mother has five children My sister is the third born She is the middle child She s different from all of us She is the only one that has gone back home to live with our parents multiple times Her most recent return was five years ago It was supposed to be temporary She was escaping her second abusive marriage She has not filed for divorce Her middle child was already staying with our mother when my sister returned home with her youngest Our mother is in her mid seventies and my sister is driving her mad and causing my mother s blood pressure to go up My sister does not respect my mother and disregards her house rules For example my mother has declined her granddaughter s request to allow her boyfriend s dog to come to the home My sister recently brought home a pitbull terrier to spend the night under the guise that her 12 year old was dog sitting for her dad The youngest girl has about 3 pet turtles that she does not clean up after regularly which causes odors that my mother really hates My mother does not want granddaughter s boyfriend spending multiple days and nights at the house The boyfriend was given a key My mother is livid My sister is also a hoarder Her room has enough room for someone to walk into it sideways This is a constant point of contention in the household My father never corrects her and actually enables her behavior She has disrespected my mother screamed and cussed at her whenever my mother becomes fed up and tries to correct her My mother wants her and her daughters to get out but my father will have none of it My sister is employed and could ve gotten her own place but she pays for private school for my niece and money is tight She contributes maybe 150 towards rent but that s actually not even a problem It s the disrespect disregard and dismissal of my mother that us four siblings really resent We do not live there and we feel helpless My sister says that our mother does not love her and that we also hate her This is not true We do not love how she treats our mother About a year ago we did an intervention and she cried and we all felt sorry and everyone tried to put the pieces together and move on She got on medication for anxiety and it helped with her anger issues and we thought things were improving Recently after the dog incident she threatened my mother by telling her she was going to have her committed to a hospital where no one would find her and we her other four children would have to take my sister to court to get my mother out of the hospital This scared my mom because she doesn t really know how that works and she actually believed my sister My sister only talks to me She does not speak to the others Our relationship is contingent upon me not interfering on my mother s behalf Last time I stood up for my mother my sister blocked me and stopped speaking to me for a year I am angry because she does not listen to anyone except for our father who does not correct her The strife between my mother and sister started when my sister ran away multiple times when she was 15 On one of the occasions when she ran away my mother told my father to let her go My father always went to find her He would find her in a group home somewhere I don t remember how my sister learned that my mother did not want my dad to go searching for her when she ran away It might ve been me I was 13 and I missed my sister when she would disappear in the middle of the night without saying goodbye I never heard her leave and she never told me before she left She would just disappear My father would grill me but I never knew I even got slapped once for saying I didn t know where she ran off to He thought I was lying Corporal punishment was our norm but that was the last time my father ever put his hands on me because I threatened him that day When I was a kid I resented my mother for telling my dad to leave my sister out there by herself I couldn t understand it but I have forgiven her and I understand that my mother probably did not know what to do with my sister My sister married her first husband when she turned 18 and subsequently came back home because he was physically abusive That time I went and got her and brought her home She has been leaving and returning since she was about 23 24 We ve been dealing with this for 25 years It s like my sister is stuck I left home for college and have never had to return to live since I go there sometimes to say hello and check up on my parents I love both of them They did their best with 5 kids and not a lot of resources My sister blocked me about two days ago because I stood up for our mother and told her if she didn t stop disrespecting our mother we would be taking legal action She mocked me and said What are you going to do Call 911 You re going to evict me She said this like a whiny teenager She acts like she s still 15 AITAH if I join my siblings in filing a report against her for elder abuse and requesting an order of protection for my mom We don t know what to do She s out of control",,,sibling

text body: This might come across as chaotic because of my state of mind but I hope it makes sense My mom hates me She has a long standing habit of exploding at me in ways that are far from kind She s called me countless names and threatened to hit me and it s honestly unbearable I hate yelling it overwhelms me and she s an incredibly loud person I ve tried asking her to stop but she never does which leaves me feeling helpless She s called me selfish brainless idiotic and worse Meanwhile my twin sister though she s been scolded has never been subjected to the same insults My sister lies constantly even about trivial things to avoid being wrong or to shift blame Her behavior frustrates me deeply and I feel trapped because I can t trust her even when she might be truthful As for my mom it s clear she has unresolved mental health issues but she projects them onto me and it s tearing me apart I remember one night when I was hungry and added extra food to my plate My dad agreed it wasn t much but she went on a tirade calling me selfish and yelling until she stormed off I was so drained that I didn t even eat that night Her double standards between me and my sister are maddening I almost wish my sister could experience the treatment I get just so she d understand And yet after all this my mom wakes up the next morning and acts as if nothing happened I don t get why she gets to call me selfish and brainless and all these names in our native language when I was the one who had to step up when she decided she wouldn t cook us food a while back I was cooking mine and my sister s lunch and breakfast maybe while also doing my school and not sleeping because of the stress I have health issues Severe health issues that she still hasn t brought me to a doctor for I remember I couldn t breathe in her car because of the AC so I opened my window and she and my sister both got mad at me and forced me to close the window They then decided to go shopping and leave me in the car without an AC On the way back my cough was so bad that I was this close to throwing up and all she could talk about was her car that she left in absolute filth with her papers and her bags everywhere I m so fucking tired so so fucking tired of being so alone All of this is happening while my dad lives in another house he used to be the closest thing I had to an ally in this house and now I feel like I m trapped and villanized by everyone else Honestly the only thing I can use to justify all of this is the fact that she probably hates me because I just don t understand why",,,sibling

text body: For a little background my family is religious I myself am as well However you might call me extreme or extra depending on who you are I do not believe that we should be practicing pagan holidays For example Christmas Saturnalia Yule Easter The celebration of the fertility goddess Eostre Halloween Samhain etc All of these holidays were Christianized by the Catholic Church when Rome made Catholicism the nations religion I personally believe we have been indoctrinated for centuries to celebrate these pagan traditions In the modern age people don t even bat an eye Their parents did it so they continue on doing it Nobody ever questions why we celebrate them Well after I read the entire bible I didn t see any of these holidays mentioned I began to question why we celebrate them After digging for almost a year I decided for myself and my family that we will no longer indulge in these ancient rituals With reason I believe the Catholic Church whether intentional or unintentional created a golden calf out of these holidays Neither God nor Jesus instructed them to do this Now when I told my parents they were pissed Saying what so you won t be coming for Christmas or this or that Or saying that my kids will miss out on all the fun But then I jokingly said to them oh so if everyone jumped off a bridge are you going to join them Because that was always an answer I received when I wanted to do something everyone else was doing I believe we are children of God in Babylon so why should we follow the rituals and practices of the Babylonians We are supposed to be set apart from everyone else However fast forward to 3 years later my parents almost sneakily do things with my daughter Like Easter egg hunts Christmas presents etc it really irritates me that my parents have basically said screw that we are still doing it with your kids It s disrespect and complete lack of understanding as to why I want to set a different example for my children One where we worship God and not worship materials and self which is what many of these holidays have turned into Just a consumeristic material money grab It s not about God it s not about Jesus and I don t want this perversion in my home I don t want to keep my kids away from my family but honestly if they can t respect my boundaries I will be forced to Does anyone have any advice If you tell me to lighten up with the holidays I will ignore your reply Thank you in advance Ps I m not saying I don t celebrate holidays I just only celebrate the ones that God ordained For example instead of celebrating Easter this year my family will be celebrating Jesus s death and resurrection during Passover Because biblically that is the period of which it happened You can read the 4 gospels and see that Jesus is the Passover lamb of God The last supper was on the feast of unleavened bread",,,parent

text body: My dilemma Am I helping my kids or damaging them My 45F mom 66F let me know yesterday that she feels like she is walking on egg shells around my kids 11F 10M 9F and 5F The 10M is on the autistic spectrum though high functioning and the 5F has ADHD For background my mom engaged in several different types of abusive behaviors while I was growing up She did not know and was encouraged not to stand up to my dad so she took her anger and frustration out on us kids Being the oldest I have the most memories of this time period When I was about 15 years old both my parents began getting therapy and studying parenting courses and things improved significantly About a year ago while watching my children my mom took them to the supermarket ended up forgetting the bananas at the checkout station realized it after she and the kids were already out in the van and requested my oldest then 10F to go into the store by herself and retrieve the bananas At that time my daughter told my mom she didn t want to go into the store by herself She asked if one of her younger siblings could go with her My mom insisted she go in by herself My oldest daughter did as my mom asked but was very upset by being asked to go into a very large very busy store by herself Once I had the kids back at home my daughter asked to no longer go to Grandma s house I found out what happened from both my daughter and my mom and asked my mom to please not have my kids go by themselves into the store by themselves especially if they are saying they do not want to My oldest stayed cautious around Grandma but eventually seemed ok until some new infraction occurred This time my oldest refused to tell either Grandma or me what Grandma had done that she did not like I asked my mom what happened and she had no clue While my daughter might just be a horrible communicator which is why my mom was unaware she had done anything that caused a problem it is also true that having allowed herself to be a doormat to others my mom occassionally walks over other people the way she allows herself to be walked over But this does not happen often now as far as I know Though I asked my oldest what had happened several times over the next 2 months the only information I got was that it had something to do with Grandma Eventually my oldest confessed she couldn t remember what had happened that made her so upset Not certain if there was a legitimate concern or my daughter was just emotionally immature and not handling conflict well I did not pursue the subject My oldest has continued to be withdrawn from Grandma and now brings her tablet and hides away from others for most of our visit at Grandma s My oldest does get angry at me often Though most of the time I agree with her I was in the wrong Only twice has my oldest stayed angry at me for more than a night I have anger management problems that I am working on but the progress is slow as it is tied into my childhood trauma Yesterday while again watching my 4 children My mom watches them about 6 8 times a year my son brought some of his Legos to her house which is not allowed because in the past he has stolen her Legos pretending they belonged to him My mom thought he again incorporated some of her Legos into his current creation and his creation got damaged He freaked out insisted all of the Legos were his and began yelling throwing some of the Legos and leaving the room 2 of my other children let my mom know that what she did was not ok I addressed my son yelling and throwing the Legos by telling him that being upset was ok and telling Grandma what she did that he did not like was ok but yelling and throwing things was not ok I also reminded him he is not allowed to bring his Legos to Grandma s house because he stole Legos from Grandma s in the past He grabbed his Legos and went out to the van to wait for the rest of us While my 5 years old continued to tell Grandma what she did was not ok My mom has been upset and uncomfortable about these three combined events She let me know she feels like she is walking on egg shells and feels I do not back her up and support her rules with my kids While she finds watching my kids uncomfortable she has no problem with my brother s 6 children and believes this is because my brother and SIL teach their children that Grandma s house has her own rules and they have to follow them While I suspect I am siding with my kids As a side note while my children struggle in school and 2 have an identified learning disability my brother s kids are all high achievers So I do suspect the problem is me I realized after my conversation with my mom the conflict between her and m kids is so uncomfortable I have been reducing how often she watches them I am getting ready to almost stop having her watch them altogether now finding out that my 2 oldest don t want to be there and Grandma is also uncomfortable But am I really doing what is best for them Or am I socially disabling them",45,Female,mother

author: Appropriate-Ad5799
text body: Hi everyone I m reaching out because I m struggling with a difficult situation involving my mom and I m not sure how to approach it Over the past few years I ve noticed significant changes in her behavior and I ve started to realize she s been using drugs I ve always suspected she was taking sleeping pills but recently things have gotten worse She admitted to using cocaine but I think there may be other drugs involved possibly something worse like crack cocaine based on what I ve found at home She claims that her drug use started after the death of her dog but I suspect she has been using for much longer My sister and I confronted her when we found evidence of the drugs and we even tried to intervene by having a family meeting to discuss her mental health However she s very resistant to any help and insists that this is her life and we shouldn t interfere She responds negatively to any attempts at helping her often saying things like I m the mom I don t need your help or I don t care about your concerns The situation is also affecting our work We run a small business together and while the company itself isn t at risk her lack of involvement is causing major communication problems She often sleeps through work hours and we have to take over tasks that should be hers including responding to the boss and handling important work related issues It s frustrating because she s the one with access to the company s bank account but she s neglecting those responsibilities which leads to fines and other issues This dynamic is also creating tension among us as employees She s the highest earner but does the least work and this causes frustration among the rest of us The employees know what s going on and it s affecting morale especially when she snaps at us for doing her job when she s too out of it to do it herself On top of all this I feel incredibly powerless I ve been trying to help her but she doesn t seem to care about the consequences of her actions It s hard for me to see how much of her behavior may have influenced my childhood and while I m grateful for the material things I ve gained because of her it s hard to process all of these mixed emotions I ve been trying to get her to see a therapist or go to rehab but she denies that she needs help I ve visited a psychologist myself to learn how to approach the situation but my mom has refused any involvement Recently I tried talking to my dad about the situation but he feels that I should just keep trying to help her through her depression I m also dealing with my own feelings of frustration and guilt I feel like I m constantly trying to help but I m not seeing any progress It s emotionally draining and I don t know what to do anymore I feel especially frustrated when I have to take her phone and respond to work messages because she s too out of it to do it herself Sometimes I even have to make decisions for her about things like groceries as she sleeps all day and isn t available to tell me what she needs Has anyone here experienced something similar with a parent or family member dealing with drug use and mental health issues How did you manage the situation What steps did you take to get them to accept help if at all I m looking for advice on how to approach my mom handle my own emotions and manage the impact of this on my work and personal life Thank you so much for your help",,,child

wrong But do I have choices I am from middle class family and an elder son of my parents Things started pretty early in my life I am more near to my grandparents rather than my parents and after my grandparents passed I can t find that connection with parents anymore Things adds up when I started with my job at 23 and bought my first flat at age of 25 First car at 26 With no time to enjoy the age I had 0 friends the only people in my life was from my office colleagues become my friends and I tried to open up a little I found my love in office only and we got married Even though we belong to same caste and social background things got worse for me Daily quarrel between my mom and wife adds up to my mental state and many time I have gone through mental breakdown crying at night when everyone sleeps is kind of started happening regularly I tried to converse this with wife but it s not helping it s like taking sides no one is ready to define what is right and what is wrong Everyone thinks they are right Making fool of myself I tried to end this situation by living separately but it adds up more since we got our daughter and things were not good with my wife s job I never wanted she to quit her job to make the life easy for daughter and home I left it to her to decide We ended up living together with parents to make the everything go easy for everyone It s not that I never interacted with my parents about the state of my mind but according to them it s what everyone deals with so I am no different They never understood whats happening inside me As days passed the communication between me and my wife started hitting the bottoms She is more comfortable with managing the daughter and doing all chores at home and her job And she seems happy about it however we were awful in bed with no communication She does care of me a lot but she didn t have solution of my problems I started wishing to run away from my daily life to achieve mental peace now It s not that I don t love my family or wife or daughter but I cannot stop loving myself to smile back at them For many days I keep on searching for Goa holidays I used to plan for things to do a bucket list but I never got chance to execute it The bucket list was very simple if you ask for 1 Spend entire day at beach 2 Have conversations with foreigners 3 Ride a bike with someone behind me 4 Try a fish dish 5 Visit a good nightclub 6 Taste alcohol As you see above I have this missing from my entire life Somehow I lost all these years of mine One fine day I just booked it I did reservations of a 4 star hotel in north Goa Before few days I started searching for some sites to get a travel companion with me After searching for few I found a girl who is 23 and accepted my request to become companion It was one of the hardest decision of my life harder than earning money Being married to go with an unknown girl and staying with her in same room for 5 days I know I could have booked two rooms but I am also a human being I see opportunity in this not all items are in bucket list I somehow convinced my family that I am visiting delhi for office work but went to Goa for holiday As I reached hotel I saw a young girl waiting for me in hotel lobby for check in To be frank my body was shivering meeting her and shaking hands with her We both checked in and went to our room For initial 4 5 hrs we just discussed about our life why she do what she do Whats her exit plan to get out of this lifestyle to understand how she manages all this sort of things meeting with strangers etc I also opened up in fact I was able to open up more than with my wife as there was no expectations from her She was in listening mode She never questioned me for anything I am doing She told me that she has seen people going through worst conditions I clearly told her about my fear of someone finding us and recognising us in goa but she was very clear that she will manage and usually no one cares what happens in goa I really appreciate her clarity of dealing with things We went out and had a relaxed sunset with dinner During night I made few things clear I was not looking for sex I wanted a person who understands me and be with me on my sides In fact I asked for a cuddles while in bed We both went to sleep without getting physical but in my mind I have already cheated on my wife That night I had a dream about how I meet with her and all our marriage rituals It s one of the hardest night to sleep on Next day I told her about my bucket list and she agreed me to show some good places First one is to try fish its always been one of my to do thing to try a fish but I didn t know what is what And how to eat it That day and next day we tried Surmai Bangda Bombay Duck king fish etc with all the difference they have she helped me to understand how to clean those fishes and what to eat and techniques they mostly tasted to me similar to the coconut in a nutshell I thanked her from my bottom of my heart that she took me to different places A day after that I got all my bucket list checked going to beaches and talking to foreigners having beer We meet two beautiful girls from Germany and South America at querim beach they were on holidays We had a very good chat swim with drinks with them Next day I was a bit nervous about last few days and things been very crazy for me As an introvert person I couldn t have imagined doing all these stuff alone No way I would have been shitting in my pants before approaching And she dropped a bomb about a nightclub on Sunday at Hammerzz I have never been to nightclub not even any club in small cities I know what to expect but I was not ready to dance alone She gave me confidence that I will enjoy it So we got ready she chose a white cotton shirt with blue jeans with sneakers is the best choice for the party she wore a beautiful skirt she was looking very pretty Its been 11 PM when we reach venue and as we enter I unlocked one of the most crazy memory of my life It was one of the most memorable things I did in my life We started with beer and ended up with whiskey and with all sorts of snacks in between I saw young girls coming alone for party young boys looking for hitting on someone Old looking guys with young girls BTW I don t look 39 according to her I am not bald Infact I have dark hair and some salt pepper look and old ladies hitting on young guys It s all sort of crazy stuff I ever imagined happened in that one night We returned to hotel around 4 am not really that high but feeling sleepy and having painful legs It s that night she kissed me on my lips and we slept hugging each other And here I am sitting on bed next day morning and writing this confession Two more days to go I have already cheated on my wife by considering someone else in my bed But I achieved my lost years from my life I do regret what I did and why I did but the regret is overshadowed by the achievement from my personal front I do realise that money can buy happiness and infact all those years of hard word I did to skip the fun is in fact paying the charges for this tour I saved some money for self love out of my earnings that is what is sponsoring this trip I do have to face my wife and family with a poker face Not sure how things will turn out for me in future I really wanted to do things that I love from bottom of my heart but life with responsibilities is not allowing me to proceed I just wish to not repeat this episode again because if I do then it will go beyond repair Finally its true that What Happens in Goa Stays in Goa for me its forever",37,Male,son

author: 
text body: I am planning to cut ties with my family I don t think it is healthy for them or me I think I have a lot of covert narcissists in my family but I am not sure Most of my family members say condescending things and are emotionally distant Most are also very materialistic and don t show a lot of empathy My parents are probably nicer compared to their siblings but they are at times emotionally abusive My Mom was always very critical of me very controlling and I felt like I had to do everything right Sometimes she was nice and sometimes very mean very split personality My Mom didn t like to leave the house much but when she did she would become verbally abusive I remember my Mom having frequent meltdowns in stores and berating people and I would hide in the shopping cart afraid to speak or be noticed When I became a teen I think I started to feel responsible for her meltdowns and was emotionally coaching often She struggled with her weight and self esteem and I was always there offering emotional support It was hard to get her to reciprocate though I was bullied a lot I had friends but I was autistic and other students didn t get me Sometimes she offered comfort but sometimes she was very dismissive and would say things like I don t know what to tell you I was a cheerleader and everyone liked me I came home from school crying a lot I remember coming home after school and wanting to talk to my Mom and she would shush me because Oprah was on so I would go to my room and cry I would spend a lot of time crying in my room and no one would come check on me My Dad would also sometimes tell me to shut up if I cried I was always told I was too sensitive but I think that I experienced a lot of emotional neglect They also often tell me to go to therapy if I get mad at them but they will never go themselves This last year my sister had a wedding overseas where she lived and my Mom couldn t attend really she seems agoraphobic But she did offer to pay for my flight so I could go But when my Mom saw the pictures of the wedding she got jealous and took her name off the Delta credit card so I would be stuck with the bill She then included me on a group chat with her friends and sent a photo of my sister in our mother s altered wedding dress with a text that read Neither of my daughters could fit in my wedding dress My Mom has also accused me of going on a date with my Dad if I ever went anywhere with my Dad I once went with my Dad and my two children to a theme park and because it was far away and my Dad has health issues we decided to get a budget hotel room for the night I slept in a bed with my kids they were very young at that point and my Dad slept in the other bed Afterward my Mom said it was creepy and made comments suggesting incest She also accuses my Dad of cheating on her all the time and he is nearly disabled so it is just ridiculous Years ago Mom also inherited a million dollars when her brother passed away I am a single parent and my ex was abusive and took everything in the divorce He also quit his job so I would have to pay him child support I have sort of struggled with financially and with my mental health due to past abuse but have worked as a preschool teacher and supplemented with a lot of house cleaning jobs to make ends meet I am on Medicaid but she is reluctant to give me anything My Dad will just go to the bank and transfer money if my car breaks down or I am having trouble paying my bills but my Mom will never help She says the money is to take care of my Dad but she is also a shopping addict so she is finding other uses Recently I find out that they are spending thousands of dollars on MLM scam products their neighbors daughter is selling I got angry and their confronted their neighbor about targeting them and taking advantage of them on FB because they were publishing pictures of my parents saying another _ _ _company family member Both of my parents are avoiding medical treatments because they don t want to pay for them but are throwing away money at the grifters they live next to Both of my parents have sent me long texts demanding I apologize to their neighbors I have stayed in touch with them because I wanted my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents But my parents never contact their grandkids and hardly do more for than send them a card for their birthdays There are time my Mom is empathetic and my Dad is not emotionally distant but the conflict is still very difficult for me I think that was the only reason I kept trying was for my kids but I don t see how they benefit at this point I really don t feel they care about their grandkids even though they say they love them and guilt me when I tell them they don t act like it Does this sound like emotional abuse My sister says we are just dysfunctional but I don t think she gets targeted as much as me It really feels messed up There are times when they are nice but it is always like night and day with their moods and I can t stand the volatility of it anymore",,,

text body: Alright so I don t really know what I m doing here I guess I m kinda looking for somewhere to just vent it s gunna be pretty long because there s a lot of stuff I m covering There s also a lot of people involved so I ll try to keep everything an organized as possible but it ll probably get pretty chaotic lol I 18 f have lived with my mom majority of my life with her having primary custody of me and my sister 16 f I ll refer to her at J My mom and dad got divorced when I was about 5 and J was 2 A few years later my mom met the partner she s been with for over ten years I ll refer to him as A A was ok for the first few years he overstepped a lot and tried to make J and I see him as our father even going as far as making us call him dad But as I got older and my mom gave birth to my half siblings T 11 f and R 7 m his favoritism was more obvious A is a by the book narcissist nothing is ever his fault everyone loves him having to also control every single aspect of our lives J and I also had to live with constant mental and emotional abuse as well the older we got from both A and my mom Long story short living there was an absolute nightmare I graduated from high school May of 2024 and for a while it seemed as if things were finally starting to turn around I had two jobs throughout the summer and my mom was being less strict about who I was hanging out with and what I was doing I did find out that my mom had been taking money out of my account without me knowing and when I asked her about she had said it was to help with bills so I just dropped the subject I wouldn t have minded giving her some money to help out but it was the fact that she d been taking it without my knowledge A wasn t around as much cause he was going more traveling for his work it was a blessing to have a break from his constant judgement lol That was until the weekend of my eighteenth birthday My birthday was on a Sunday and my dad was planning on picking J and I up that evening I wasn t allowed to drive my car to my dad s because A payed for it I had spent the day with my best friend K A was out of town so my mom said we d just celebrate my birthday when he got back My sister T had a volleyball camp the next day that my mom had asked me to take her too she had a meeting at work that she couldn t miss and I agreed I had just been there planning on driving the car I d been using at my dads to drive to my moms house around the time my mom usually left for work But apparently my mom had gotten all upset because she d expected me to be there earlier to help get the kids ready to go something she did by herself most mornings because I d leave for work before the rest of the family even woke up My mom blew up texting me about how I was just an ungrateful brat who only ever cared about myself Keep in mind I m basically the oldest of a whole herd of kids from both mom side so I was constantly forced to be a third parent for my siblings Anyways that morning my mom told be to just drop both mine and J s phones in the mailbox at her house and said When it s convenient for me y all can get the rest of your clothes and stuff Spoiler it s been over six months since the incident and J and I still haven t gotten our stuff So just to recap everything mom made me take J and i s phones to her house J had to work and I still had to go to work that day I d just planned on going in later I had texted my dad about the situation since he was also at work and transferred all the money from the account that my mom had access to into a new account I also emailed myself screenshots of the conversation and deleted almost everything off of the phone I gave back to my mom I went to work barely holding myself together at the end of the day I talked to my boss and asked for the next day off to try and get everything sorted out and thankfully he was understanding and gave me the day I asked for That night when my dad came home he was absolutely pissed at my mom he made sure both J and I knew we could stay with him as long as we needed He also took me to get a new phone the next day and added my line onto his account he added another line and gave J his old phone I texted my mom s parents from my new phone and told them a less detailed version of what happened and they were also pissed My grandma went off on my mom and A her and my grandpa had stopped by my moms house to try and talk to them about it but from what I heard it turned into a screaming match between my mom and grandma Since the initial incident my dad was able to get primary custody of J that way my mom wouldn t be able to try and force her back to their house K has been super supportive she also went through something similar with her dad but that s not my story to tell Everyone on both sides of my family has been super supportive of J and I other than A s family because I m sure mom and A told them some bullshit story and not what actually happened I ve been trying to take lunch to T and R at school but last time I talked to T she said that she had gotten in trouble for talking to me so I haven t taken them lunch in a while because I don t want her to get in trouble I also found out a lot of stuff about my mom that has changed my view on her and I don t think I could ever see her the same way I used to So back to present day it s been almost exactly 8 months since my mom kicked J and I out and we still haven t been able to get our stuff J recently turned 16 and got her drivers license and has been talking about trying to get ahold of our mom since we re pretty sure she block my new number I told J not to text mom from her new number cause when I did that mom gave my number to A and he started constantly calling and texting me until I blocked him I just don t know what to do at this point because I have a lot of keepsakes and books and such that I want from my moms house but my dad said he doesn t want to fight my mom anymore I already called the police department and they said there s nothing they can do without a warrant or unless something physical happens So I guess if anyone had advice that would be greatly

while no license and my mom made us cut off family so i am stuck My sister who i hate calling my sister has been antagonizing me ever since she could speak shes dropped out of school at 15 and has been home since not trying to get her ged and with my mom not caring about it either when we were little my sister would frequently hit me when my mother and grandmother werent fight me scream at me and in one instance she pushed me into a glass mirror that then in turn shattered all in my back and i ended up getting in trouble for it so ive learned that shes basically in the right no matter what and nobody ever listens to me from ages 12 16 she somehow has gotten the craziest audacity seemingly out of nowhere Shes been sneaking out every night one night the cops coming to my door and bringing her back and her only being in underwear and a tank top at 4 in the morning mom was at work and when i told her it she didnt seem to care then she would frequently come home smelling like weed and vape i told my mom and she basically said she knew but again decided not to do anything about it i tried to blow it off but there were times when i would tell her how terrible of a parent that made her and obviously you can tell how that went i almost got kicked out and arrested several times for the disrespect even though my sister swears at everyone lines like im gonna beat you the fk up stupid bch then at some point my mom decides to have a conversation with me about her after my sisters court hearing I ask her why she lets her act this way and she says she threatens to k ll herself whenever i tell her anything i tell her that its her responsibility to put her in counseling or therapy and she says she will nothing ever comes of this situation She continues to act like this daily but its been getting so bad that she actually lays her hands on me and my mother proceeds to scream at me while it happens and tells me if i lay my hand on her kid im getting arrested snd that this is my fault and that she would do the same thing to me if it was her so i obviously lock myself in my room with cuts and bruises all over myself while they both scream and bang on my door threatening me I have anxiety disorder have been diagnosed in 2nd grade This sends me into a panic and i spend my night hyperventilating off and on i eventually selfh4rm at times to fast forward to now im freshly 20 and ever since i was 16 my mom has been calling me an adult but refers to her 16 yr old who has slept around done drugs gotten tattoos and piercings swears at adults and fights people a baby the house we just moved into has doors that slam all night if the window is wide open due to the wind i brought this up to my sister one night because it was loud and impossible to sleep keep in mind she is the only person to do it and is known to antagonize people she threatened to fight me over the fact that i asked her to do something about the slamming so i eventually just tried to ignore the slamming but tonight i couldnt sleep the slamming was louder than ever its about 7 in the morning so im thinking that everyone is asleep and sneak over to her room i open her door and shes asleep i figure shes asleep so she probably wont care as shes a heavy sleeper i close both of her giant windows and walk back to my room 5 minutes later it starts happening again i walk back to her door and its slamming again she hears me and starts cussing me out saying stop closing my sht before i beat ur ass i say respectfully its loud and keeps slamming i cant sleep and she gets even louder which is even more rude because we live in a townhouse with one house on each side so shes screaming loud enough for both sides to hear her so i go whatever and walk back to my room i lock it because i know her here she comes barreling through the hallway screaming and shouting that shes going to beat my ass she proceeds to bang my door so loudly that it wakes up my mother obviously the first thing that happens is my mom starts banging on my door telling me to come out i open the door and they both start screaming at me i tell my mom please listen and she goes no dont touch her shit i beg her to listen to me and she doesnt i close my door and hear her talk softly to my sister while shes still screaming are you okay just calm down its alright she listens and they both go to my mothers room and both start to joke and laugh with each other Im supposed to have orientation for a job tommorow but i cancel it because i know she wont take me her anger lasts for weeks so now im sitting here crying contemplating my life trying to keep my crying quiet because it only sends her into more of a rage because im an adult and adults dont cry i cant even breath out of my nose and my eyes are swollen and i just started my period but i cant leave my room so im stuck in fetal position in my bed i dont know what to do i have nobody no friends no family no money no job no car nd i forgot to mention but after the ordeal they purposely kicked my 2 cats out of the house which the animal abuse could be its own thread my family are terrible individuals But i have so much kindness and fear and feel that saying anything to anyone about it will only put me in danger and leave me in a even worse environment so i do nothing this isnt even the tip pf the iceberg anything bad that could happen to a person has happened to me and i feel hopeless",20,,

text body: For context I am a college student My parents are divorced I live with my mom dad lives with his second wife in another city I share a decent equation with my dad and his wife We have fun we go out whenever we meet With my mom I have came to the realisation that it s better I only speak to her when I need money or a life threatening emergency In any disagreement argument she tends to vent out her divorce frustration on me Indirectly and directly saying bad things about my dad being mean to me She even blamed me for divorce while I was the one who stood with her when her own parents my maternal grandparents literally cried as divorcing my dad would mean they won t get his monetary benefits and said things like now they have no support while I was the one assuring them things will be fine and made sure no one pointed fingers at my mom Mind you I was 17 that time Now I am 21 I thought things will be better this woman turns every minor disagreement into her divorce frustration She says she has the right to be mean as she earns and I don t so when I earn she will stop being mean Mind you this woman let my grandparents abuse me verbally didn t take any actions when my grandmother literally burnt my expensive bottoms as it was short I feel so betrayed She keeps telling me to leave the house she uses me as a medium to remove her divorce frustration These people don t realise that divorce is harder on the child than a couple the couple may eventually get married but I only have one pair of parents She has said things to me like I wish I never had a child and you are the reason I took a divorce and you were born that s why my career didn t flourish Like I was the one who forced her to have a kid We had an argument today morning I am just unable to function Had to force myself to eat as I didn t feel hungry at all All I feel is being on the bed and doing nothing I am just lieing down and crying constantly freezing and getting fits of rage s I feel so exhausted and my heart rate is also high I have just locked myself into my room now I just feel like being Alone and doing nothing",21,,

text body: I ll try to not make this long winded but here we go This might be more of a venting session in a safe space than anything but I d love advice My sister and I have never gotten along perfectly She s a year and a half younger than me and has always been a spitfire as my parents like to say I truly had good intentions as an older sister I didn t go out of my way to tease my siblings her and I have a younger brother In fact I truly loved playing with them when I was a kid and spending time with them My sister on the other hand we ll call her Katie She definitely liked trolling us especially my little brother She was always getting in trouble with my parents and had tiffs with other kids at school Katie is very smart very scholarly but other than pleasing her teachers she gave alot of people a hard time She is very messy and she even used to take stuff from her room clothes shoes garbage etc and would stuff it under my bed or in my closet behind my clothes when she wanted to clean her room quickly so she wouldn t get grounded She did this until I was in college so not that long ago She would take my clothes from me and never ask and it got to the point where I convinced my parents to let me get a key and lock for my door The dynamic with her and my brother has been the same over the years She s very judgemental of our friends girlfriend boyfriends spouses When we were in highschool my brothers friends would refer to me as the nice sister if that says anything to you Or people would just straight up say she s a bitch and I was left to try and defend her Fast forward a little I m in college and she s a senior in HS She rummaged through my drawer and found some cute pajamas and underwear and told my mom insinuating that I was trying to dress sexy for my boyfriend now husband Katie quickly and suddenly had no problem throwing me under the bus to any capacity At one point she took my phone and went through my texts and showed all of them to my parents Sexy texts to my boyfriend This aided in creating a huge divide with my parents who were helicopter parents and my sister totally fed the fuel into the fire Mind you I was 19 years old trying to mind my own business and go to community college I wasn t drinking or even partying All the while my sister used this campaign to her advantage so while the attention was on me she was out partying and drinking as a high schooler She brought it up a few years ago and thought it was worthy of a laugh I didn t find it very funny This is just high level stories She continued to try and sabotage my relationship with my now husband even though he s a very good guy and my parents now get along with him very well Additionally my brother and my husband get along very well and my brother always gave him a chance Another example of the dynamic my husband and i took a semester off to travel abroad My brother thoight it was cool and exciting My sister talked behind my back to my parents telling them she thought I was being greedy and blowing my money I hesitantly included her in my wedding party and she was of no help what so ever I did it to keep the peace I had one tiff with my mom where I put my foot down about inviting one of her aunt s who turned a blind eye to my mother s step father who was an abuser Naturally I didn t want her there My mom tried to shrug it off in order to have more family at the wedding and somehow my sister sided with her Then behind my back Katie said I was doing this on purpose so we have less family at the wedding She said this in front of my brother and thank God he had my back and called her out She went a year without speaking to me because I finally tried to put my foot down about everything Then she held Christmas hostage and refused to show up unless I apologized I said no and then I suffered dearly for it My mom was very mad at me for not apologizing she s a whole other story after college her and Katie became thick as thieves once I fell from their good graces as the innocent virgin golden child Now to the present time I ve glazed over alot of other crappy things she s done but basically everything has always been tactical for her However she can throw me or my brother under the bus to make herself look better The cherry on top is she s got alot going on in her life where we ve all been very supportive She got pregnant with a boyfriend she didn t know well they got married a year later despite red flags he was an alcoholic owed the IRS quarter of a million dollars she was trying to finish school making no money I have done my best to be supportive whenever she needs me During the covid lockdown I sent her money when her work closed down When she had her baby I flew out to be there for two weeks to help I even took newborn photos for her I do photography on the side Then she got divorced and shes now in a relationship with one of my brothers best friends No one in the family loves this but we re all supportive regardless Meanwhile when my brother is around she loves to talk shit about him and how dysfunctional he is Shits on his relationships and friendships other nitpicky little things When my dad s not around she loves to talk crap about him as well I m scared to know what she says about me when I m not around She is very very mean about her previous husbands ex wife His ex wife now prompts hangouts with Katie so their daughters can hang out which I see as a very kind gesture despite their past of not liking eachother Katie makes fun of this woman s looks her weight her personality everything This past Christmas she asked me and my mom to join her as a buffer for a get together with this woman so their daughters could hang out And before we showed up she said I saw on TikTok that she got hair extensions She has terrible thin hair Wait till she sees YOUR hair Then she ll see what actually long hair looks like Then I thought to myself Is my sister using me as part of her entourage to make this poor woman potentially feel bad about herself It s just too much I m at a breaking point where I truly can t stand being around her She is very negative loves to gossip about other people and is severely opinionated On top of this I have very repressed feelings about everything she s done throughout my life and especially my adult life I know this was a mouthful but I m running out of wind on being nice around her Truthfully I ve been conditioned to be cautious in my responses Conditioned like a dog with an e collars on It s so fucked up Anytime she s severe in opinions I try to be subjective but cautious in my approach I m tired of always being gentle and cautious as if she holds all the cards But any time I ve put my foot down she turns things into a nightmare and gets my family involved to take sides Any thoughts Do I just say screw it and be honest and call her out I m at the point where I have reoccurring nightmares where I m just screaming at her and even get physical It s obviously weighing very heavily on me",,,sister

text body: Part 1 I got to vent somewhere 12 years of context to hit Mil Bella 70F and Gio 35M names changed Myself 32F Gio and I are both only children our kids are the first grandchildren on each side FIL passed away before they came to the US gio and I met early 20s I m American he s European culture differences are there but did he s best to adapt since he came over at age 6 Bella has been here 30 years and still holds the thoughts and ways of their home country Met 2012 He owned a business after school care tutoring for kids and teens all the documents and bank accounts are in her name because he opened when he was 17 bought the lie she gave him that he couldn t have an LLC since he wasn t an adult No matter how he pointed it out she refused to sign things over despite I m tired of sitting in this office chasing people down for money We never saw bills and was only able to guess income she liked to haggle unapproved discounts and refused to up rates on old members Cuz my name is on the business she owned a landscaping business and Gio has been her employee since he was 14 Let s just say in both she liked to do some creative book keeping her favorite was not accurately reporting cash I say this cuz since gio was 14 she has given him allowances as he got older she paid him just enough to cover his expenses If he wanted money for a date night or anything she d hand him cash My nephew needed a math tutor he did it a few months before I started picking him Over those months we started talking at pick up Turns out they needed someone to do arts and crafts with the kids I had no problem working for 3 hours after my waitress shift We started dating after I started working for them 2013 Bella was thrilled by this when they talked but had nothing to say much to me She never tried to bond with me past gossip about clients in the office with the door open or I love my son but was a common phrase our early years together I had worked for small places before so a business check normal But since it was w9 i tax time I lost 1k of my return from my w2 job cuz she didn t let me know that it would be w9 vs w2 income More than once Bella would make a comment towards a kid about weight intelligence or religion culture Sometimes they went unnoticed other times he had to smooth things over always siting his mom s culture that sometimes she says things she doesn t realize mean something else One occasion we had a pizza party Bella to Muslim girl that wouldn t eat cheese pizza cuz sauce on it it s just like cheese bread but instead of dipping it in marinara it s on it Why do you have to be so picky Sighs well I guess you just won t eat then Your family is always so much trouble I remember she came in with a bad attitude made worse by kids being there whose parents didn t pay for the pizza party saying they pay at pick up Which was something she let slide before of course they did it I m allergic to tomatoes I walked in the office grabbed my cheesy bread and gave it to child When asked what I was doing we can share can t we girl nods besides it s not often I met someone else allergic to tomatoes Muslim kids in our care were told by their parents to tell staff they are allergic to pork Gio later asked while the kids watched a movie what that was about needless to say he nearly dragged her into the office If the kids needed help and she came over it was always a you re not even trying I m not helping you or you re really not getting this I m not just going to give you the answers Yes some kids just wanted us to give them answers but most of the time this wasn t the case heavy kids or just big eaters do you really need another snack You seem like you have had enough to eat You don t look like you are starving I got good at seeing when kids were struggling before they said to avoid her comments We lost kids often due to her words and actions Everyone in this country is just so sensitive Plus we didn t have contracts her idea cuz they are a hassle to cancel with the bank parents would just not bring the kids back we reached out she was to blame 75 off the time she had a very do it my way when I say to or you re doing it wrong and will mess everything up mentality I worked with her for 10 years was her DIL this attitude held even for me I wasn t allowed to talk or take payments from parents only tell them the good stuff about their kids No matter how stupid or bratty the kid is a year into our relationship our town started a motorcycle rally The three of us agreed to go together on Saturday after the tutoring students were done Bella reminisced about how her and Gios dad would motorcycle around Europe The next year this rally happened Gio was out of town in a business conference I was waitressing and he wanted me to just be at the business I told him I d only feel comfortable with that if taxes started being taken out or if she agreed to pay my taxes She agreed to pay me in cash I told Gio I would be keeping my job as a waitress because I made just enough to get free healthcare And liked getting a tax return to building savings He was good with it given those things back to the rally Gio and I both thought it was a good chance for her and I to bond We did nothing without Gio she was more focused on him herself It was a hot week she had been telling me to have the kids to drink water and watch for signs of dehydration I asked her if she was landscaping in this weather she said yes I let her know I hope she got everything done before it got too hot Friday she was complaining of a headache I asked if she was okay If the heat had possibly gotten to her I m fine and yes we ll go to the rally tomorrow Saturday morning the kids are dropped off and she comes in foul her and Gio got into that morning over our lack of bond Bella told him our lack of bond was my fault I didn t care to know anything about her Mom OP was the one to bring up the rally to me asking if I d think you d like to go walk it with her She s trying Just take care of the kids go on nice a walk and go home She sat in the office the whole time I knocked came in to let her know I ll change and we can go She looked drained like she didn t feel great I made the mistake of asking again if she felt up to going This was the hottest day of the week the rally wasn t in a shady spot and wind wasn t blowing It s okay I know you don t want to be seen with a fat old broad like me Grabbed her bag went out to her car I changed and closed the door I wasn t trusted to lock up She wasn t getting out of her car i walked over to talk with her Just go do whatever I don t want to talk to you Let her know I m sorry for offending her I just wanted to check she felt up to it cuz she d worked all week She didn t respond locked up got back in her car just get in your car so I can go soon enough Gio called I answered he went mamas boy letting me know had offended his mother and needed to apologize My repeated checking in had bothered and her feel unwelcome yet She also told him I had ignored her all day and canceled on her I told him what really happened what if he didn t believe me to go check the cameras and I don t appreciate getting yelled at without getting to tell my side He agreed my story sounded more real and he didn t need to check the cameras I told him 1 I was not going to fight with him about this 2 it ll be a long time before I try to do anything solo with her 3 I m not meeting them at the airport tomorrow He asked if we were done this was our first fight besides this he had always been a green flag I told him we can work through this but if things continue this way he cannot expect me to have a good relationship with his mom According to him she was sad I didn t met them at the airport and hoped everything was okay Getting to their business Monday I let him know I d be getting there with the kids due to work she was at the door looking actually happy til she noticed me walking through the parking lot I said good afternoon and you could tell she was upset I was there instantly It s been 10 plus years I still don t have a good relationship with her After that anytime I offered to do stuff 1 on 1 she never offered she turned me down Bella started turning down events with gio there cuz she didn t feel up to it Christmas had always been hard Putting up the tree cuz it s tradition Gifts were kept at a minimum too much made her ackward Christmas before we got married she got me a 23 and me dna kit I knew this was about seeing if I had dna from their home country I had just enough dna to make her happy thank god when the results came back While Gio is proud to be from his home country nothing to that level My folks mom factory job 12 hour shifts 3 days on and 4 days off next week it d switch my dad was on partial disability cattle ranch 2 hours a day At the start of Gio and I getting serious I spent half at home the days mom worked so I could care for dad and half with them Only after we married did I move in with them full time By then I had put in the paperwork for my dad an overnight nurse the days my mom worked Bella caused 3 scenes at our wedding 1st she drove them and was thirty minutes late to grandparents I know the way missed the exit cuz Gio was correcting her since she d only been to my grandparents twice in that five years 2nd she didn t want to be in pictures at all not family photos not a shot of her and Gio 3rd when she was ready to go she made it known to everyone Gio told her if you want to go go Op and I will be home later She was appalled we didn t leave with her Our wedding was a rush job my grandfather had cancer took a turn and it was if you want him at the event do it soon Honeymoon she called at every meal Gio gave her five minutes then found a reason to hang up Living with her I wasn t allowed to cook the stove oven heating element is off so it s really easy to burn food the fact her pots pans came with her from Europe she d be devastated if they were burned or scratched Given this Bella cooked all the meals I couldn t even cut vegetables Laundry could only be done on Sundays by her since The washer is old and knob is really picky I couldn t even wash my own clothes household cleaning also had to be done on Sunday She would complain that we treated her like a servant Gio would spend his Sunday cleaning and always took the trash out during the week without being asked Once she came in to me doing dishes seemed grateful I went to watch a movie with Gio in our room came out for snacks My clean dishes were back in the sink They still had spots on them they did not as I knew she d look for a reason to get upset Gio had heard the comment you always say we don t help out but when we do if it s not done exactly your way or when you want it you complain it s my house it should be done how I want and when I want to done This it s my house continued for the rest of our time there She had the master bedroom and chose to sleep on the couch We had to go through the living room to get through the bathroom at night this was a problem if we woke her up She refused to switch us bedrooms stating she needed her own space I worked as a waitress in the mornings and Sundays because she fought every chance for either business to grow I don t want to pay more in taxes what if he messes up As the owner I m liable This led me into missing dinner on Sunday was at work til 9pm I brought home my own dinner and a snack for Gio yes I checked she never wanted anything it s too salty opening and closing the togo boxes was too much for her one night he started taking food out of the boxes to microwave I came out to do you guys have to open and shut those boxes 50 times Man I can t even sleep in my house Gio went into explaining the situation of me being at work all day and deserving a warm meal I don t care you re both so noisy at night and always walking through the living room I can t sleep He reminded her you have a bedroom with a bathroom if you don t like your bed get rid of it put a couch and tv in there She proceeds to yell in their native language He tells her I m not doing this with you anymore It s your house you have made that clear We ll get our own place You dont have the money And I m not paying for it If I m not spending half the day occasionally landscaping for you then I can find an actual part time job that gives me steady hours You won t get hired anywhere and you won t like working for other people if you do It d be better than this and maybe we d get along as a family Whole conversation he s closing the togo boxes handing me them and plates he unplugs the microwave picks it up and nods towards his bedroom Thus began the home search It took weeks of figuring out our budget for a place since she refused to hand over his business or tell us exact how much money was being made That makes you think moneys being made I m not even giving myself a paycheck I told him okay let s base this off my checks the waitressing and the cash from the after school care Worse case the plasma clinic always wanted donors to make up the difference We could have easily gotten an apartment especially with my savings from Covid During the lockdown I didn t buy anything other than foo the restaurant had to sign us up for relief aide Since I wasn t paying her rent cuz family doesn t do that I had a good amount saved he wanted to help I told him good luck They fought over moving out It s too much money you won t be able to afford rent and food and I don t want to be alone His answers was simple you and I fight daily You don t get along with OP Something has to change since it s not going to be your attitude it s got to be our living arrangement What do you expect me to do not live in my house That s the problem it s your house not ours yours If we want to make chicken nuggets in the oven at 2am we should be allowed too If we want to wash clothes mid week we should be allowed too We need our space as much as you need yours you can help us find a place or we are going with the cheapest place possible to make sure we got money to cover everything She finally relented the only benefit to having her controling finances was his credit score Talking drive a new car off the dealership lot just by signing paperwork then the issues no renters history because she didn t charge rent and no utilities in his name Loans and everything else the bank said was great but wouldn t give him a mortgage on a house Why a mortgage on a house vs an apartment you ask she convinced him rather pay the bank than a landlord that could kick you out for no reason Our state didn t have great renters rights I told him since no bank would let us mortgage an apartment was our only option He said we could always have the house in his mom s name and us pay her I told him if we do that she ll hang it over our heads we are still living in her house she d find away to put the bills in her name she d never get a lease agreement written and she ll never sign the house over He said that happens we ll find some way to cut ties Someone get me a medal cuz I called it We moved in October 2021 The house needed minor repairs but we finally had our own space I wasn t allowed to paint one bathroom as she had to bring in a plumber to finish the shower and an electrician cuz if you plugged anything in the lights dimmed and flickered Those guys never got hired We got some water damage didn t hire anyone to fix the roof I don t call laying down fresh shingles fixing the roof until we had a move out date for the cross country move TW February 2022 we found out we were pregnant I was super happy to not be living with her something in me screamed something was wrong I told Gio how I felt asked if we could just keep this to his mom and my parents as I didn t want to tell people incase He agreed I told him he had better stay on his mom We told our parents on Saturday Monday evening I caught her telling parents when they commented I looked tired Remember we don t want to tell a lot of people especially since we know nothing yet I know I know I just get excited I was excited Gio was excited did she really think we didn t want to tell people everyone knew because she told them before we had our first doctor s appointment We went to the doctors appointment and didn t get good news they said there s a small chance they caught us early and baby was still developing but I knew we had miscarried Gave it a week and they confirmed it My body refused to give up the fetal tissue to the point I had to have a surgery we grieved I took a week off work because I just couldn t be around the kids I came back and she hadn t said anything to anyone Everyone assumed I was having morning sickness needed time to adjust hey mommy how we feeling Conversations kept happening end of the day I locked myself in the bathroom to cry before we went home Bathroom was right next to the office Bella what s the matter with her I had miscarriages you re the only baby I brou ght to term I walked out of the bathroom Did you have someone telling people you were pregnant Even though you asked that person not too You took the joy of me getting to share our news And replaced it with pain of having to tell them no You had a week I know people probably came to ask how I was doing since I wasn t here You can tell them the good news but left me to tell them the bad I m not coming in the rest of the week so you can tell everybody you talked to the news Grabbed my stuff went out the door without waiting for a response Yes I stayed home that week Yes Gio supported me and told people when they asked him No she didn t tell anyone the bad news I ignored her presence civil when we had to interact This was til December 2022 when we found out we were pregnant again I told Gio let him have a few hours to enjoy the feeling then asked what we d do about his mom Cuz i didn t want to have to go through that again He said we d wait til to see when the scheduled us for an appointment first Appointment being a month out and the morning sickness already hitting we had no choice We agreed I go to work when I felt up to it I took leave from the restaurant Got diagnosed with extreme morning sickness and a health baby at the appointment Gio and I still asked everyone to please let us be the ones to share the news My parents not a problem Bella she might have told a few of the more concerned parents I ll admit I got to tell a lot more people this time But she still broke a boundary I was just keep it civil Now we always closed for spring break Gio was trying for a big revamp especially with a baby on the way He had a cat and everyone will tell you pregnant ladies can t clean the litter Bella came over daily there was no how you feeling I already knew what baby shower theme I wanted was diying decor I set out my projects hoping she d ask nope didn t say anything It was like she was ignoring our pregnancy She waited til the last day when she caught me and mom coming back from grocery shopping to ask if I needed anything Told my mom baby comes I ll get a part time job just to make sure they are taken care of Bella swears she never said this what happened was the straw that set me in permanent civil mode as Gio was fine being his version of LC but can t bring himself to go full NC Day of the anatomy ultrasound got in there tech asked and we wanted to know It s a boy My dad was at the ranch so he got a text My mom napping after a 12 hour shift so text Bella knew when the appointment was roughly when we d be done He asked if he could call since she wasn t a big texter I told him to go ahead This B I m picking out plants with a customer I ll call you back and hangs up Even I wasn t expecting that Gio was devastated We went to go get milkshakes our tradition after appointments I asked him what he wanted to do he said she can call me when she cares She had ruined the moment for us we got home and she called him he was outside talking with her in the native language for hours When he was done we just cuddled on the couch To the baby shower I went with a cafe theme table for three cuz we had Italian for our first date we had a sandwiches pasta bar Italian desserts grape juice for wine ect We agreed to have it at the after school care center in our common room Since we were doing it on a Saturday I showed up on Friday did crafts with the kids and decorate Mil asked are you sure you want to do this You cant honestly be expecting a lot of people I was pissed because no matter the crowd I wanted to celebrate I worked hard on the event for us I was doing it I sent out texts calls and a Facebook event According to just Facebook we had 30 people say they d come and another ten say maybe That s not including my family and people that don t have facebook I organized it so the kids could play games while the adults chatted Food is going to be buffet style made sure everybody know they can pop in say hi then go about their day She stared at me and finially said it just seems like a way for you to get free baby stuff and that just doesn t seem right to me before he could say anything the words came out of my mouth they say it takes a village raise a child Sometimes the most supportive members aren t the ones related to you she had ignored our pregnancy ignored our baby updates and now wanted us to cancel the shower so she didn t have to deal with people Gio ask earlier what she wanted us to tell people when she wasn t there She really didn t want to come I m not saying throw money at us cuz we are having a baby but at least acknowledge the updates Of course my words hit a cord what time does it start tomorrow 11am a lot of people said they d be in when we get started We will be coming early to finish set up With that she left As soon as the door shut behind her I turned to Gio If she causes a scene tomorrow I will tell her to leave She s got two strikes that I ll damage control then throw her out myself He was also upset knowing how much work I had everyone shows up at 11am minus her she walks in at 11 15 sour look on her face seeing people slams the office door Gio nods I knew the angry hushed tones he left the office and for an hour she behaved herself It came time for gifts we sat and she had to put herself right next to Gio my mom was snapping away at pictures When he pointed out if she stayed there she d be in pictures she bolted We got maybe three pictures of her total Btw if you re wondering about her gift there wasn t one Gifts done kids playing games people snacking we wanted one family photo Bella ran to the office to get her camera 10 years I have only ever seen 5 pictures ever taken with this camera She insisted on taking the photo vs being in it One of the moms even said she d take the picture with that camera and my phone Gio it ll be really hard to explain to your grandson one day why you aren t in this picture Tone read get in the picture or leave She got in the picture again said no one wants to see a fat ugly broad Guests left food packed up I wanted to sit for a second before we took down decor She started a cleaning rampage If you give me a second I ll tell you want needs to be packed away and what can be trashed Oh let s just take it down go home and sort it later Because I m the one that has to sort it and honestly I don t want to do that Trash can here works just fine She scoffed and kept going mom enough It s not being helpful it s creating more work If you want to leave leave we handle it and I ll come clean tomorrow If I help it ll go faster and we can clean together today and you can unpack it all tomorrow I was done got up started packing what I wanted to keep The rest goes in the trash she looked at me like I was crazy You re trashing all this But you worked so hard on it I did work hard on it but it s served its purpose and since we are having a baby we don t have room for everything anymore This B proceeds to grab a bag and start collecting things she wanted to keep I sat back down Gio imma load the car If you want to go anywhere or pick up anything please let me know I kept my eyes on his mother I m good for the day some people just can t help themselves and ruin my mood Nightly phone call between him and Bella that night was again outside in their native language Onto the delivery we told my mom She was actually on her way to sit with me while gio landscaped with Bella He called and told her I ll work and be there after a shower labor is a long process Getting to the hospital my mom called everyone else Gio more worried about me than what his mom said developing a she ll get here when she gets here attitude I labored for five hours she still hadn t shown up according to my mom Everyone else was there even some friends were there in the waiting room Once there again she was pissed she wasn t the first one Doubling down when she heard I had just delivered it being the golden hour I told the nurses no one is allowed in End of the golden hour Gio went to ask friends to come back tomorrow they all obliged Family was allowed in my parents over joyed my grandmother tears Bella wouldn t hold baby boy I m all awkward in these situations My brain went no crap out loud I managed not to comment My dad and grandma left My mom went to get us dinner Bella stayed baby boy holding her finger in his crib She asked when he was going to the nursery we told her he s not He s not leaving this room Nurses came in she refused to break away from baby And started talking to the nurses about time in the nursery vaccines and circumsision Things Gio and I had already discussed and talked about with the staff I looked at Gio it was obvious I wanted her to shut up But he couldn t get her to Eventually I looked at a nurse what looked like she was over it too I nodded she came over can I have my baby please She looked way too happy to take baby from crib and give him to me Bella left shortly after called Gio that night I was so proud to hear mom we had already talked about all that together and with the staff If cared to talk about our decisions regarding our son before his birth you should have asked Next year August 2022 2023 is really easy to condense for you Bella came over to our house twice in the first two months Both times less than 30 minutes because baby was asleep Eventually guilted Gio it s a long drive wasn t even 20 minutes he s always asleep he s a newborn and I feel awkward I wanted the complaints to stop if you want to take him over that s fine but it won t change anything She ll still complain and probably not even hold him we went dinner and a quick movie She had dinner ready hated the fact Gio ate first I had him eat first so they could have playtime and I could eat in peace She chose to sit at the table watching Gio hold baby while I ate Went to go watch a movie she wanted to watch something new I pointed out if he s up and fussy no one s going to be able to catch anything we settled for something we had watched before I gave baby his bottle after I offered for her to feed him she said no then once he started getting sleepy decided she wanted to hold him She held him for about 30 minutes as he slept Then he woke up was immediately back to me no attempt to soothe him herself We did this twice each time a week later it was back to complaining about not seeing baby and wanting us to stay longer One day Gio wanted to give me a rest day he d do all the baby duties and I could just relax He quickly realized just how much work went into caring for a baby We talked about it later that day yeah you didn t even have to pack the diaper bag prep the bottle get him dressed get yourself ready none of that for when we go to your moms He realized then she should be coming to us if she wanted to see baby She refused cancelled and tried getting us to come over last minute I didn t work at the after school care anymore cuz the kids wanted to treat him more as a baby doll than an actual baby This continued til baby was 6 months old that was the next trip to her house She didn t hold him didn t feed him just like the pregnancy basically ignored I sent pictures videos of milestones and just happy baby moments oh how cute he s growing so fast I wish I could see this in person or just a basic emoji was the response No checking in how I was doing no Christmas gift for baby but guilt tripping that she didn t get to see baby Baby s birthday one party at our house for family and another at a restaurant to catch up with friends Our house she took Gios time by talking in hushed tones in the corner and standing in the way He almost missed the smash cake photos and presents cuz of her I had scheduled party times to be right between naps She wasn t invited to the restaurant but somehow came anyway We were opening gifts she came running up is this a scam Shoving her phone in gios face during cake she decided to go play the arcade game in the corner I told him I m done she s ruined yet another event I m change him and then we ll have to go it s almost nap time the after school care building was leased the roof started leaking before baby s birthday Leaking got so bad she called the landlord Come to find out he d let the insurance on the building lapse and she never had any on anything but the business Given that insurance couldn t be involved they agreed to get it fixed out of pocket Landlord had been a roofer back in the day Well he went to work didn t put any weather proofing down a section of the ceiling collapsed in after a rain storm Lucky it was before kids came in and left that room locked It took them six months to fix the roof with no leaks no gaps no accidental skylights During this entire time the business was hemorrhaging money We Gio and I were stressed she seemed bothered but not overly worried Gio couldn t watch baby so I could work because he was working morning and afternoon with her landscaping coming home for lunch and then leaving to go teach in the evening He had a friend that moved out of state cross country actually to be around family The friend offered Gio a job his business had three smaller rooms and a common area they didn t need Figured with the roof caving in no one offering after school care in his area they could combine forces This offered burned in gios pocket for a bit he didn t like the idea of moving from coast to coast just cuz of a landlord that couldn t get the roof fixed a business that was failing and his mom fighting him on every chance to improve the business Said it wasn t fair to me my folks or baby My folks would never get on a plane it d take them a few extra days drive due to my dad s health to visit and they d have to make sure my mom had enough vacation days basically zero chance of them ever visiting I know what you re thinking just pick up more landscaping customers Bella refused on grounds again she was the business owner and didn t want to be liable if he made mistakes Gio brought up getting his own LLC and customers working morning afternoons on days she didn t paying her rent on her tools and consulting fees as needed She told him you ll be competing with long standing businesses with bigger work crews so more availability for customers He asked if she d let him take over her last three customers when they are done I m done and what I get from them is barely enough to keep my house going All that being said it was the move or find something else completely better the devil you know he knows how to run build and operate an after school program Even better without Bella standing in the way baby boy turned one and we decide to move My folks were pissed but said they understood yeah no they didn t understand they are currently LC minus unless I send pictures videos of the baby everyone turned toxic Gio went out to see before we moved the whole family Facility was perfect for what we needed There were kids that would join the program when it started Lease agreement Gio could be added too His friend was even willing to let us run the program three months rent free to make sure we were good Gio gave me the okay I started downsizing donating packing with a toddler and no steady help I didn t feel great one day and recognized how I felt Took the test I was pregnant We always said we wanted two kids close in age so they could bond and do things together Originally plan was to wait til our first was 2 well our first turns 2 years old 2 months after his sibling is born This didn t make anyone feel better about the move My folks more upset and uncomfortable Bella came to take care of the cat litter and I m so busy never stayed to watch baby boy so I could pack or shower never asked about cravings or if I needed anything My mom came over her days off minimum hour so I could shower and us eat Max two hours so we could eat and I could pack a little This cycle continued for the three months All with getting diagnosed with extreme morning sickness to the point I lost ten pounds I didn t see Gio at all my first trimester minus daily video chats Now we decided to drive taking the important belongings baby stuff and putting the rest in storage We only had the one car and Gio had drove it out to the other coast so he didn t have to rent He thought our support system would do its job I had minimal support my grandmother she was the rockstar Twice a week for five hour stints she d come baby sit the toddler so I could pack Bella was dropping off donations and taking stuff to our storage unit Gio had her put on the lease for the storage unit so she could have access to it Plan was to transfer her the monthly fees and shipping costs Gio had found out one of the former after school families was planning a trip to the same city we were moving to Brought this up this is where stuff went sideways She brought up paying the dad to drive the Uhaul and us fly She d keep our cat didn t like us paying pet fees plus a pet and two kids in an apartment Saying this would be so much easier since OP is pregnant and baby boy won t have to sit in this car seat the whole time I told Gio I d still rather us drive so I can hurl was needed sleep bring our cat and keep baby boy away from airport germs If anything still pay that dad to drive the Uhaul and us rent an suv to take everything in one go He liked this idea looking at all the costs Bella pushed her idea I didn t like this idea Eventually between doing everything I told Gio I m out I m done so long as I m with you where I m actually heard I don t give a poop we ended up flying Bella the dad and the next door neighbors loaded the Uhaul I put the toddler in his play pen and slid boxes towards the door Daily life stuff first apparently this took all the room Bella wouldn t allow me out the door to look and see if I had any boxes that could fit Baby items home decor knick knacks ect left behind for her to take to the storage unit later There s no room left You ll have to visit to get the rest and the cat or I ll ship it to you Moving truck leaves giving me a few days more with my folks and to label storage unit boxes Gio came in on an evening flight Picked up me baby boy and the cat up to stay the night at his mom s We left the next morning via plane We arrived and got to our apartment a hours before the moving truck Upon the moving truck getting there opening the moving truck we found out it was only half full We had plenty of room for the baby stuff Gio and I were pissed but we aren t due til May It was November The dad said he thought it was odd we didn t use every last bit of space but Bella told him that was everything we were taking I immediately looked at Gio he told me he d handle it All the boxes brought in toddler in play pen I started talking things out of boxes Bella called him shortly after her response to why there was still room on the truck well you said you were coming back for Christmas I thought you d pick up the rest and the cat then I said we d try and that just means we d have to fly in get a rental and drive across country like we originally had planned vs flying in and out The visits home flying between locations would have made more sense I knew we should have stuck to our plan of driving to get everything else here Well you got the important stuff she snapped Really What about the baby stuff Op didn t give that to us to put on the truck Mom I m calling bs You told him that s all we are taking You told her there was no room left So we literally have nothing for baby number two here Well then I ll ship it to you and you can grab the cat when you visit It s march 2025 and let me tell you what we have gotten shipped to us 3 care packages of food 2 boxes of broken decor because she didn t bubble wrap the items and here s where I lose my cool I had a few plastic bags last minute donations Bella went through them to pull out toys our first born doesn t didnt never wanted to play with and sent those instead of stuff in storage I told Gio how sad I am to know we now have to rebuild everything for baby number two Especially since baby wasn t shy about showing us the fact he s a dude We still had the infant car seat the bath tub bottles blankets bibs play gym toys clothes everything I won t get pictures of our boys in the same outfits most of which were hand me downs which I love because someone held onto them and loved them just for our child to end up with them playing with the same toys We always said two babies which is why we kept everything Last I heard from her go through the storage unit when the weather is good Aka it s not a worry of hers So she ll get to it when she ready Meaning never",32,Female,Daughter-in-law

author: Sleepy_treehugger
text body: TLDR Should I contact my dad after 10 years of No contact Tw Child abuse Hi sorry for the long back story but I am more or less typing this out to clear my thoughts out and try and come to a decision on something that has been bugging me most of my life I am currently NC with my 35f Father 56M I haven t had any sort of relationship with him for almost 10 years He was 21 when I was born and married to my narcissist of a mother Shotgun wedding thanks to being pregnant with me They had another daughter 3 years later my sister who I am NC with and she is NC with our father They ended up divorcing after some very miserable years of constant screaming abuse allegations and my father getting drunk at his work Christmas party and calling her a fat bitch in front of everyone just before my 7th birthday The separation and divorce were hell He acted like any immature guy in their 20s slept around had different girlfriends in and out of the house and was having a great time except for my NM narcissistic mother trying to make life as difficult as possible denying him access to us demanding the house etc For a couple of years he had fortnightly weekend visits with us When he did not have a girlfriend in the picture he was a great dad camping trips always outside doing something with us playing bike riding etc etc etc BUT when there was someone he was seeing that would completely flip and feel fake Initially he would sort of put us on display his whole demeanour would change and he would make a huge effort with their children and give them all of our toys etc while we were at our mothers I remember coming over one time to find my entire room had been given to a girlfriend s daughter She was wearing my clothes and had destroyed some of the toys I had gotten for Christmas and my Birthday and I was told to just get over it Then the Girlfriends would slowly start treating me like crap at first when he wasn t around but slowly in front of my dad and he just went along with it no matter how ridiculous and would either get mad along with them or not say a word in my defence He would also do things like drastically favour my younger sister Ie she would get all brand new toys and a big Birthday party every year and I would be lucky if I got something second hand from a garage sale that he found on the way home from picking us up Same with clothing days out etc She would always get what she asked for and I was told No Around the start of the year I turned 9 My NM was sick of us seeing him They both put me in the middle of their divorce Telling me horrible things about the other My Nm demanded that I stop seeing him and He kept telling me that I could come and live with him full time and not have to deal with my mother s abuse anymore I distinctly remember him telling me to just go inside after visitation let my mother know that I wanted to stay with him from now on and then come back out and he would be waiting and we would go home I did this only to look out of the window and see that he had left I was out the front crying for a good hour waiting for my dad to come back After that my trust was gone I gradually started refusing to go and after a very nasty court battle He gave up From 10 onwards I did not see him After this my mother s abuse drastically escalated We were homeschooled and had no one in our corner to tell I started attending school at 12 when the education department told her that we were too far behind and that I had to go to mainstream school I later found out that she had told the entire family it was because she could no longer tolerate my behaviour At 14 she tried to have me placed in a children s psychiatric ward to fix me Because I was plotting my escape for when I turned 15 with help from my year co ordinator after they had a run in and she sat me down and asked to know what on earth was going on at home and I had started to fight back when she started either hitting or screaming at me a daily occurrence in her house later on I found out this was after nm had tried to get me expelled from school and or sent to Juvy for abusing her and the police had declined to intervene So after two weeks of back and forth trying to decide what to do with me as after the 3 day hold was up they had said that I didn t need treatment rather that I lived in a toxic home environment and my mother and I needed some serious family counselling At 14 nearly 15 I was placed in temporary foster care for 9 months Family therapy did not work as my NM refused to participate saying they needed to just fix me The therapist then fully supported me in my decision not to return home After the temporary orders had expired my Foster mother allowed me to live with her for a short time until a place became available in a youth homeless shelter I was declared independent by family services helped to get onto social security and that was it I was on my own A month or so after this happened I received a call from my social worker My dad had recieved a letter saying that he was no longer Liable for my portion of the child support he had been paying to my mother surprise surprise she had been claiming money for my care the entire time I was in foster care He had called them freaking out wondering what had happened to me I permitted them to give him my contact details and shortly after my Nanna called me She told me all the things I wanted to hear how they had missed me so much and always knew I would return to them I agreed to meet them all the next weekend and go from there I met them and things seemed great My dad appeared to have changed and grown up a lot in those five years I hadn t seen him He was now with a partner and they were expecting a baby together in a few months and I had a stepbrother I gradually started spending most weekends at my dad s house while still living in my independent little flat through the youth shelter We had lots of fun during these months BBQs family camping trips and big Fillipeano parties my new stepmother was from the Philippines things were great and I was so happy to finally be a part of a family that cared about me and treated me so well I was promised all sorts like trips overseas and help to buy my own house and car when the time came etc etc After my little brother was born things seemed good I loved him with my whole heart and loved looking after him and spending time with him but things between my dad and stepmother started to go downhill She stopped attending so many events with him I started hearing him bitching about her to friends etc etc They went to the Philippines for a month now no mention of me coming along and soon after they got back her brother was killed brutally and shockingly She shut down and was grieving and my dad was very nonchalant about the whole thing I don t know what happened between them after this but His gossipy neighbour kept telling me they were screaming and fighting all the time and had the cops called on them He was accusing her of cheating and I know he was cheating on her She started calling me asking where he was etc and I had no idea and asked to please not be involved as it had nothing to do with me Just before things really hit the fan they had offered me to move into one of their investment properties I had originally declined because my boyfriend and I had a house but they kept insisting Saying that there were better job opportunities in their country town that they would reduce the rent for me and I could do what I wanted within reason with the house We ended up agreeing and moving in with the verbal agreement that we would pay 180pw and Dad an extra 30 because apparently the bank wouldn t let them go under 210 a week payment or something Being barely 18 at the time I trusted them and let it go We faithfully paid the 180 every week and were living there when they started fighting constantly So many times they would leave my then 2 yo brother with me for days and weeks at a time and I couldn t reach either of them pick up times were ignored and texts were unanswered all while being a teenager and trying to work and take care of a gorgeous little boy who probably knew way too much of what was going on Did I mention this place was a total dump too Things falling apart disgusting carpet fixtures in the laundry that electrocuted you when you touched them no heating barely any AC and eventually no oven for 2 years Every time I asked for something to be fixed I was met with Oh yes I will get onto that or I am really busy for the next few weeks can you just do it As things got messier and messier between them and they eventually broke up the excuse changed to Oh I do not want to fix it if she is going to get the house He also started saying that our rent was late and could we please just give it to him and he would transfer the whole amount rather than having to go into the bank every week Yes I know massive red flag but I was a dumb ass teenager and believed him Months of this went by and he met a real crazy Lady that he ended up moving into his house She was NUTS from the get go Opened and threw out my Birthday present from my Nanna because she didn t like it full on telling me all about my Dads sex life despite me saying I was uncomfortable with this Making my brother miserable constantly calling me at all hours of the day and night convinced my dad was cheating or because they had a fight I don t know how she got my number I guess from his phone but I never gave it to her Babbling Crazy stuff about how I needed to forgive my dad and move on then banning him from seeing us or dropping my Brother off with me and lying about going out with friends His friend s wife was talking to me a few weeks later about how it was a shame we were all sick that day and couldn t attend Trying to Convince everyone she was a supermodel BATSHIT CRAZY Anyway while dealing with all of this we recieved a knock on the door from the Bank with a foreclosure notice Turns out my father and his ex had not been paying the mortgages on any of their properties while they were splitting up I had enough by this point and did something dumb and stopped paying rent and started to look for somewhere else Eventually my ex stepmother accessed her super and managed to save the houses She then Hired a real estate agent and got the house we were living in their settlement She also served a notice that our rent would be increasing and backdated it 90 days so it was effective immediately Turned out she was trying to claim we owed rent right from the time we moved in and that we owed 3 years worth of the 30 my dad was supposed to be putting in then all the time that he hadn t put it in when I gave it to him in cash Luckily I had some receipts and I was able to argue to the real estate agent that we had reported the oven not working and that it had been 2 years of an essential item not working so I managed to negotiate a lot of the extra claims away I found a new house for rent a few weeks later and moved We were told that because we still owed money no matter what we were not getting our bond back I was really angry by this point and didn t bother to clean a thing We left and never heard from Ex Step again After all this there were a few more instances of minor disagreements with my Dad And a few that showed me just how selfish he was My Brother came to visit Dad one day and had Welts all over him He had been blamed for a hole in the wall at his mother s house he claimed his brother did it not him His mother had belted him buckle end for lying He was 6 I begged my Dad not to send him back Very indifferently he replied that he had to work I said I don t care Protect your son from this I will change my shift I was part time at this stage barely making enough to survive And work around it so he doesn t have to go back to that He still sent him home and nothing ever amounted to it but a warning from CPS when it finally was reported weeks later I said I was going to report her but he said he wanted to speak with a lawyer first He rented out another house to my partner s sister and left her without hot water and other issues for days on end until after a year she had enough and moved I of course was used as a go between because he couldn t talk to her like an adult Would constantly leave my brother alone in the house I found out they even did this as a newborn baby when he and his ex worked on the afternoon night shift 5 minutes from their house they would leave him alone during changeovers and this progressed into leaving him in the house alone at 4 or 5 to run to the store One time when he was around 5 I dropped in to ask my dad something My brother said he was at the shops and had been gone a while I waited an hour and a half with him until our father returned He said he was only gone 5 minutes when I said that wasn t ok Would pressure me into cancelling work or plans to watch my brother If I said I was busy or no He would leave him alone or with unsafe people Started nitpicking about my weight and making myself feel a bit crapy about it did this to my brother as well trying to put us on diets exercise plans etc and making my then 7yo brother throw away his easter eggs Still treated my sister like gold she would only see him on HER birthday or before Christmas and he would buy her beautiful thoughtful presents every year Me who was watching his son and helping him to renovate most of my spare time Oh sorry I am a bit broke and can t afford anything for you Would book holidays that I couldn t afford either say he would pay so I could come along or say it was a price much lower than it was only for me to drive out to wherever and discover that I had ALOTT more to pay than originally mentioned or full on my share that I would not have agreed to come along if I had known about having to pay Would constantly complain he was broke He had a good salary His house was almost paid off after he broke up with his ex and his other 2 properties were making more than the mortgage payments on them I saw the bank statement once His total Mortgage costs that he had to pay were 60 A MONTH He was giving lifts to everyone to work and making 50 a week on petrol the women he worked with often brought him meals to share so he rarely had to cook or buy groceries got to love Filipeano mother hens I on the other hand was supporting my spouse and myself on minimum part time work paying rent and often food for my brother most weekends and my BIL who was having issues at home Always puts his girlfriends and his needs and wants above his kids Started dumping things like an old car that he wanted to fix and take to his friend s property in our yard because he did not want his yard to look messy then when we asked him to move it said he was too busy and get my Partner or BIL to do it because it didn t matter if they got a fine or lost their licence My BIL finally did do it because he was sick of it being in the yard and then my dad refused to drive him back home BIL lost it at him and it There were also lots of little occasions I would catch him in lies or he would ask me to back him up or lie if someone asked me about something I told him that I didn t want any part in this didn t like being dishonest with people and I didn t even see the need for the lie most of the time Don t get me wrong I fucked up along the way too there was the whole rent incident and there were also times I was struggling and having car problems He offered to loan me money and I did but I took a long time to pay it back Another time he bought a car off of his friend They wanted 3000 for it honestly I could have gotten a running car for 1000 at the time and been ok but he insisted that if he was helping me out then it had to be this car I agreed and paid some off and I was really struggling at the time so I was paying little bits and pieces and he said he would write it off as a gift for taxand not to worry about it I was very grateful but I do still feel like I owe him that money I also accidentally left his sprinklers on overnight while watching his house while he was on vaccination and that would have been a pretty decent bill But we were still talking me watching my brother s terms after all of this I started to pull away after all of this and he got a new girlfriend from Indonesia I was just exhausted with it all as well as dealing with my NM I will eventually get to typing up that story a depressed partner my depression anxiety and a trove of other health issues I got to see again just how he treated his kids when he had a new partner and it pissed me off I was having a bit of a vent over email to my Nanna I have since gone no contact with her as well over this and other toxic behaviour About how I didn t like how the new girlfriend treated my brother and how my father hadn t defended him when he was doing nothing wrong I also said the same as I have above that he would disappear and be uncontactable when I had my brother in my care I am talking about not showing up at the time he said he would pick him up then turning his phone off The very next day I got a text from my Dad saying I needed to mind my own business how dare I tell my Nanna that he was out Partying every night and Don t ever talk to him again I sent him the entire email thread No where had I said he was out partying maybe projection He did not reply I then messaged my Nanna and asked her what on earth she said to him She flipped and was super nasty saying I needed to butt out of his life um yeah I didn t want to be in most parts of the things that happened I got dragged in most of the time against my wishes and almost like bragging about what she had told him It was then I realised just how true the horrible stories about her had been This on top of her just little nasty comments out of nowhere and seeing her in action turning on an old friend of hers I told her I was done And I haven t spoken to her since My Dad then ignored me every time he saw me around town He would say HI to my partner loudly and then not even look at me I was angry too Like you want to play that game My sister also messaged me that she had been invited to his wedding and was I going I said I hadn t been invited She said she was going to decline because she did not have contact with him really and didn t know anyone there 2 days before the wedding while I was at work he was banging on my door and windows demanding I come out My BIL eventually opened it and said I wasn t there he knew what my regular work days were and he said give this to her and handed him a wedding invitation He then texted me at work before I had even seen the invite or known about any of this You are invited to our wedding I sent it back No 2 years went by and my partner kept telling me to talk to him He had seen my dad around and told him we were planning on moving interstate My dad said oh let s catch up for dinner We went out to a restaurant a couple of days before we left It was all small awkward talk Nothing really got said It was a pretend everything is ok dinner of mainly my partner and Dad talking He gave me an awkward hug goodbye and that was it No contact again for over a year and we found out I was pregnant and having a son My Partner reached out to him saying that we were planning on being back in the state soon and that he was going to be a grandfather He replied that we will have to catch up for a BBQ Nothing else no reactions or congratulations Nothing my partner was a bit like wtf and left it It s important to note that my Aunt Dad s sister was a friend on Facebook throughout this So we believe she was feeding him information On the last day of our trip we were sitting around at my inlaws when my partner got a message saying What time will you be here today From my dad he replied today What was planned for today We are flying home in a couple of hours My dad wrote back Oh You can t even make time for us Dont bother So we left confused about what that was all about A few months later my Son was born Again radio silence My Aunt said congratulations on Facebook she was also living 45 minutes away from me at this stage but never reached out 2 weeks later she put up a post of my dad s entire family having a reunion less than 30 minutes away from me in our state Dad was there and again radio silence 2 years later we moved back to our home state and had our second son This time not even my aunt said anything My sons are now 6 4 especially my youngest is starting to ask questions about families and Grandmas Grandpas My partner recently ran into my ex step brother my half brother s elder brother and they have been talking about contacting my brother for me which I would love now that he is an adult The subject of my Dad has been coming up a lot too My partner believes we should reach out to him clear the air and move on Firstly I miss my dad not all the crappy parts but the good time dad when he had time for us Secondly even though he s kind of an irresponsible selfish person I don t see him doing a lot of stuff out of maliciousness like some of my other family members but rather cluelessness and emotional immaturity And thirdly there is the fact that my kids don t really have any Grandparents I am completely No contact with my abusive narcist mother and also NC with my mother in law she s a whole novel on her toxic behaviour my partner occasionally takes them to see her but she has terminal cancer and honestly doesn t have a meaningful relationship with my kids anyway His dad died years ago I think this is also why my partner is so willing to let the kids see my dad because after the stuff he has been through with his family it is nothing terrible as far as he is concerned If you made it to the end YAY thanks for your Time what do I do with this mess Do I leave it alone knowing that I am not important enough for him to reach out to me And knowing that he said never to talk to him again Does he even remember texting me that 10 years ago Do I write to him with clear boundaries asking to talk Do I let my kids meet this man knowing that at some point he is probably going to disappoint them as he has with me my entire life I don t know what to do my heart and my head are in two very different places and I feel like all the toxic people in my life have messed with my self worth boundaries and what a healthy familial relationship should look like Any outside perspectives and advice are welcome Thanks again",35,Female,

text body: Hey everyone I know this questions is a handful and it might come off really wrong but hopefully some insight can bring clarity Me and my sister have always had a complicated relationship even when we were kids As we got older everything just got worse By the time we were in high school she made sure to belittle me and remind me of how ugly I was how terrible my outfits were how annoying I am and how everything is my fault She spoke to me my whole life with such disrespect and constantly yelling A couple of years ago I started to gain some confidence and started telling her NO Or just giving her little to no reactions to her comments One day I was having a really bad day and the second I finally got home she was screaming at me because she couldn t find her razor and swore I stole it I just didn t answer because I was so mentally exhausted This led to her calling me every name in the book and me responding are you done Anything else This would be the last time we spoke She tried to talk to me a handful of times after but by this time I had a boyfriend and a group of friends that really built up my confidence I cut her off because I realized ignoring her and her eventually catching on and not speaking to me made me happier It sucks to say but im way more comfortable with myself when she s not around in my life It has been 3 years since and I moved out of the house 2 years ago and we still never exchanged words Am I wrong for this I couldn t be another person in her life that allows her to speak to them that way and stick around with no apology Unfortunately I ask this question because my family says I am the more mature one so I should suck it up and just speak to her again What do you guys think",,,sibling

1728,Should I cut off my family before I go to university?,"title: Should I cut off my family before I go to university?
author: Altruistic_Lie_6757
text body: Hi I m 17 years old and have wondering if I should cut my family off after I ve turned 18 and gone away to university I have felt like cutting off my family for many years now the earliest I remember meaning it being when I was around 13 My plan was to wait for me to get into university and then live in accommodation and to live off my student loan money and to have a side job as a tutor to earn enough money to live off of Those were my financial plans the other part was to leave for university by myself without them As it would be the perfect time as I could pack up all my belongings without it looking suspicious and mail it to myself to pick up wherever I go to university and just get the train there I was also going to leave like a letter or something with an explanation that I had left home on my own accord and that I didn t want to interact with them again so they didn t think anything bad happened Now down to the real reason I am writing I ve recently been having doubts about my plan and if I should actually cut them off So here s some main reasons why I wish to leave 1 I ve been constantly told throughout my life that I have been a burden to this family and told by my sister on a couple of occasions that she wishes I had never been born For some context I am the youngest child of 4 and my parents had me a bit later in life so there s quite a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings But back to it I have been constantly told that I was a burden and a drain on my family and hearing that a lot from growing up has had quite a negative impact on me and still hearing it is quite a sore spot still 2 I am always made to feel worthless and all my achievements are undermined not only that anything or attention I get is quickly taken away from me This has been a constant throughout my childhood and teenage years because my issues just weren t as important as everyone else A couple of main ones that come to mind the first being when I received an offer for medicine and my sister was with me she insisted that she would call both of our parents so she could tell them despite me saying I would she ignored me and did it Before that when I got another offer for medicine my first one I received and she wasn t the first person to find out she king of ruined the moment within 5 minutes cause she got upset cause she found out last she didn t and then whenever it was mentioned gave snide remarks Also when I got my GCSE results I got quite high grades so some of my family members not immediate congratulated me and stuff she would get a bit upset and say it was a bit unfair no one said well done to her when she was the whole reason I did so well My mother left me alone in an important virtual meeting type thing during high school because my sister in law needed help with cooking they hadn t even started cooking yet but my mum immediately got up and left and cause I was required to have a parent there and she was gone for so long I got kicked out of the meeting BTW they were making a simple sweet dish which takes like 30 minutes to make and they easily could have waited Nearly everyone aside from my father used to call me stupid and an idiot whilst comparing to other family members who go to grammar schools which we don t have any in the area we live it wasn t till I was 16 and got my GCSE results did it die down But since then I get told that I think I am better than everyone else whenever I even say anything 3 They re so emotionally draining to be around like hanging out with my family is genuinely so tiring and drains me so badly They will complain that I don t spend time with them but when I do all they do is belittle me or just ignore me entirely As well as that they re so manipulative and sometimes plain aggressive For example I could do the slightest thing on accident and my sister will get angry at me and be really rude to me however I am not allowed to reciprocate the behaviour I can genuinely apologise with tears in my eyes and all I get told is it doesn t mean anything However if she has wronged me I have to accept a sorry in any form if I ever do receive one and it s usually fake I m expected to accept it or she will just get angry with me again and it s awful cause she knows what do to make me upset in turn She will message me horrible things full of swears and delete them later or just isolate me or hit me sometimes and tell me she wishes I wasn t born One time she got so angry with me cause I forgot to recycle a water bottle she wouldn t let me study for over an hour and I had my final exam that day to get my result for a side subject I did in the first year of college But going on to pure anger I would have to go along to my mother and brother As I mentioned before my parents had me a little later in life so my mother has long given up on being a parent to be honest I think since I was an early teen she stopped mothering me on the odd occasion she will ask if I want something cooked I know this may not seem like much but during year 9 10 I developed some issues with my salivary glands and so I used to get really sick sometimes because my throat would swell up to the point where I couldn t drink water without being in a lot of pain It had developed so much that the doctors could actually see what the issues was so I didn t have to waste time being diagnosed for it to be in that state it has to have developed for about a year I had mentioned multiple times that it hurt when I ate spicy food and I couldn t eat it but no one believed me until the evidence actually formed Due to that I have had to deal with this issues for years and only recently gotten over it after having 2 surgeries So yes my mother was quite dismissive of anything I bought to her but she could also be sometimes violent but she mainly stopped after this one incident when I was younger On this one occasion she was hitting me with one of those wooden shoe horns on my legs so no one would see and it was punishment for misbehaving because I didn t clean up my room or something I covered my legs with my hands so she hit those and then we later had to go the hospital cause we thought she broke my wrist She didn t it just had internal bruising that s why it was so painful for me to move it but since then she has stopped hitting me for the most I think that trip kind of scared her because we just said I hit my wrist against a banister But on to more recent things she has grown quite a lot meaner she swears at me sometimes and has called me a b tch and a sl t before She tells me that I need to put an effort into how I look but complains I wear to much makeup I don t like spending time with her cause all it ever results in is her insulting me My brother he s also quite mean he s the oldest of all of us and lives with us with his own family too Sometimes when I come downstairs he will tell me to go study or sit in my room since this isn t my house and that I am getting in the way it s my dad s house not his yet I have been told this a couple of times on occasion Anything that is left outside of my room is usually used by others broken or thrown away so I keep everything to my own room now They wonder why I feel so out of place at home yet no one bats an eye when I am given a reminder this isn t my home 4 The manipulation that they do is lowkey crazy Not really manipulation this first part but another thing to note my sister used to egg my mum on to hitting me and stuff when I was younger For example when I was 11 I got a report card with 5s and 6s so Bs and Cs and she got my mum so amped up to hit me or get angry at me and done so on other numerous other occasions when I was younger too It didn t even make sense either because they didn t give out the high grades in the middle of year 7 anyways Whenever I mention this to her she either tells me I am remembering it wrong or that when it went on long enough she would tell mum to stop Tbh majority of the stuff I remember from my childhood is the bad stuff cause obviously those are the things that would stick with me right But whenever I mention it I genuinely don t know if I am being gaslit or not because they will say I am lying Then they will make up something obviously false and claim I said it to make fun of me but sometimes admit that I was telling the truth on some things Like when I was younger my sister didn t refer to me by my name she would only ever call me a b tch and made me respond to it I was around 6 8 and she was in her mid teens But they even gaslight me about things that have happened not too long ago like a couple months before my GCSEs I was fighting with my mum and sister and they both told me if I didn t do well that after GCSEs I would be 16 and they would just marry me off But whenever I bring it up and i get really emotional cause I hate that idea they claim I am lying or they were joking or something Whenever something upsets me it s a joke however ever since I have started matching their energy they have been fighting with me a lot more and saying how rude I am And when I mention this is how they act I am met with that I should be the better person There s so many other little micro aggressions and stuff that they have done as well A couple years back I was in a really dark place where I used to genuinely believe that everything was my fault and all their issues lay with me and I hated myself a lot for it and I think I may have been a tad depressed I remember my family making fun of the state I was in one time whilst arguing before I was going to shower they stopped me and threatened to call someone so I would get taken away I am grateful that I am far away from that place mentally and realise that it wasn t my fault and am thankful that I care about myself a lot more now 5 Marriage is a really daunting topic for me I am really worried about what will happen I have seen how my parents arranged one of my siblings marriages and they were tricked into choosing the one my parents wanted my sibling also refuses to back out to not embarrass our parents I don t want to go through that I don t even think I want to get married They already mention how they want to get married off the second I finish my course at university When I have openly denied I get guilt tripped by my family saying oh but we re so old and we want to see you get married Not to be rude but you had me late Respectfully that s not my problem My sister even joked once saying if our parents found out they were dying whilst I was 18 they expect me to get married I obviously said no and my mother got angry at that and proceeded to argue with me I don t want to be there for this time cause I know I will just get tricked into doing what they want and not allowed to back out to save face and inevitably be guilt tripped by my dad Just to sum it all up then for many years I have had quite some resentment for my family and cause of how they treat me still feel like I am worthless and a burden There have been quite a few good moments but I don t think they can outweigh everything I have mentioned here and some I want to cut off ties with them whilst going to university as it would be the perfect time and I don t want to continue to go through life and end up accepting this treatment I know I will financially struggle but it will be worth it to have some freedom mentally In general I am quite a happy person and quite chatty in public but going home tears that down I am usually quite non confrontational but sometimes mainly at home I get too annoyed and give in and get angry I am the type that just get angry and cries it out tho I think if I can work hard enough to be able to get some form of therapy I might as well because it feels really nice to be able to get this all out of my system I just wanted to get an outsider outlook and give a rough overview and to get an idea if it seems worth it and I am not just screwing up my life I would really be grateful for some advice",17,,youngest child

is 2 years old and doesn t know his dad very well In his eyes I am dad because I ve been there since he was a couple weeks old Anyways we knew our 1 bedroom apartment wasn t enough for all of us so me and my mom said we can all pitch in to rent a bigger house We ve been settled for almost 2 months now and there s been minor issues between me and my fiance A majority of the major concerns between us is my fiance feels I m taking my moms side whenever there s a disagreement my fiance didn t want to live with my mom in the first place because my mom has very strong opinions on how to raise her grandson She also believes in anti vax we don t flat earth and that the world is ending soon and god is coming to get us so be ready My mom goes to bible study goes to church and has Bible study homework all the time watching religious movies and shows We figured moving in with my mom we would get a lot of help with the boys but she is out of the house a majority of the time Again it s not her responsibility but my fiances mom lives down the street and she s been more of a help Main issue we had was my fiance feels my mom is too controlling over our son Ever since I started dating my fiance my family didn t like her like she was a lost cause or she was taking advantage of me Since we moved in my mom and fiance were arguing over the degree of the thermostat 1 degree issue it wasn t too serious but at that point I was the middle man Expressing how both ppl felt and that one person was warm warmest room is our room and it being cold downstairs and my mom s room I don t believe im a good messenger if im being honest i felt like this whole thing was ridiculous and idk why 1 degree is an issue But I guess i came across the wrong way and my mom goes to my stepdad crying My stepdad doesn t live here until yesterday I didn t know he helped pay to get us into the house but he didn t sign any paperwork to live here My mom and him have a son he is 16 and homeschooled but my stepdad visits occasionally I guess he s not officially my stepdad cause they ve been engaged for 10 years We used to live with manny stepdad he s a big intimidating guy probably on steroids been in the gym industry for longer than I ve been alive probably However he no longer lives with us and for all we know he could be doing god knows what He says he s been in border patrol and got a job opportunity with homeland security My uncle my mom s brother was the first one to see through his lies My uncle is a correctional officer he told manny if you work for border patrol send me an email from your government email Anyways my uncle believes he s giving my mom the run around and he s living a second life with another family Next thing u know my sister comes across a photo with my stepdad with another woman in wedding attire and clearly celebrating In the caption it says congratulations to my brother and I can t wait to meet your son who was probably 6 8 years old I believe everyone was upset me my sister my brother mannys son and even my mom I feel like my mom didn t know what to do at the time But manny being a controlling intimidating manipulative lier I wouldn t be surprised if he told my mom a tall tale about everything going on and I m sure she believes it He s been telling us he s gonna buy us a house to live in since I was a teenager he promises that he knows a guy that owes him a HUGE sum of money like last year he knew me and my fiance was struggling and he told me he would pay rent for us for a whole year even get us a nice SUV And he s waiting for said sum of money I ve always been somewhat afraid of him I do have feeling a for him because we ve known him since I was a young child 4 6 years old for me However idk what his problems are but when he gets angry he gets into pitbull mode like no calm discussion it s you listen to me and you don t argue with me He takes any resistance personal and he will get aggressive in your face called me homeboy before like he hasn t known me since I was a child and I was some random guy giving him shit Anyways manny always had these talks when my mom couldn t control me or my sister However we re adults now we pay rent and our share of duties Last year he threatened my sister when we didn t want my mom to talk to him anymore and he told my sister to keep her mouth shut or something bad is going to happen to hwr and he implied getting beat up isn t the worst thing that will happen to you we have no documentation of said threat because it was over the phone but we called the cops and gave a report My sister asks me and my fiance if manny is still home cause she doesn t feel comfortable around him This last weekend my mom and manny went to big bear and I had my dad and some family over My mom flipped out because she said no guests but I want my family to be able to visit like my dad or my fiancés mom to see her grandson Anyways she calls my dad yelling at him and i guess my dad said everything was fine until she called him a loser My dad flips out and tells her he ll expose manny and his other family Next thing I know manny is calling me because he found out I told my dad about his situation Tbh I m not very secretive but my dad knew this last year and he didn t really care or maybe he didn t but none of his business Manny is again calling me homeboy said I opened my fat mouth and he ll be here in 10 minutes I said can t we discuss this like adults He said fuck no I hung up and called the cops and put in another report manny never showed up but I got a nice boost of adrenaline over the 30 second phone call My mom confronts me later saying I need to stop telling everyone their business i never really cared to share her business until manny wants to come into mine and my sisters And she said she wants to keep us safe as she looks away and says I can t talk to much about it Last year my mom told my sister that manny had powerful friends I can t say what she meant but I m sure she believes manny has some shadowy figure that can ruin our lives like the snap of a finger Idk how they will ruin our lives but my mom believes it and I feel she is afraid I want to believe she still has feelings for this guy but idk why she defends a man that threatens his kids and doesn t want to live with the family he s know for 10 years I m a veteran I have paranoid schizophrenia the drs asked if anyone in my family has it I said no to my understanding it happens to ppl in their 20s like me and it s somewhat genetic environmental But I learned yesterday that there is late onset also that it happens more to women in their 40 50s my mom is 45 After that argument with manny my mom and fiance start arguing over the thermostat but this time they got in each others face in the hallway I was on the bed everything can be heard on camera baby monitor in our room I was tending to my infant and I heard this I didn t know what to do I knew my son was fussy and would cry if I put him down and he may feel unsafe hearing the argument Anyways I walked over with my son in my arms and I told them to get the F away from each other I feel like I wasn t being listened to so I escalated the problem I started yelling at the top of my lungs to get the f out I proceed to yell this 4 6 times and I also yelled I can t believe the shit that happened today getting threatened over the phone and that my stepdad was coming to start some BS with our kids here Idk how to go about this I brought it up with our couples therapist who sees us every Monday at 7pm over the phone And I just want nothing to do with manny anymore I m sure my mom feels like this can be fixed and her way of getting it fixed is having manny tell everyone how it s going to go down or give us some stupid ultimatum I know I was probably in the wrong for escalating the situation but I m over walking on eggshells around my mom because I m afraid of manny It s not fair to us and I don t like the personal bias she has towards my fiance And it s not all sunshine and daisy s with my relationship but we re working on it Sure we get upset with each other and need space But I feel like we found a bigger problem in our lives and it just muted out any issues we have with each other I feel like we want to leave but I don t have enough money to do so and getting enough space for us is going to cost way more I just don t know what to do manny wants to talk my mom wants to talk This morning she calls me saying she wants to talk and gets all angry about me not wanting to come outside Then she told me to stop being a prisoner and grow some balls",,,

text body: First time poster I ll try to keep this brief Character list Reese older sibling Lacy younger sister Kira youngest sister Bella my mother Alex my father ALL NAMES ARE FAKE I 14 afab masc nonbinary he they do not care for my family My older sibling 16 afab not sure of their gender identification they them makes me incredibly uncomfortable with comments about my appearance and my body My younger sister under 10 can throw a tantrum over the smallest things The youngest is under 5 and I really don t have much to say about her My mother 37 39 cis female constantly claims to be supportive but refuses to use my name or acknowledge the fact that I am part of the lgbtqia community My father 42 cis male is barely better than my mom Barely He s called me my chosen name a few times only once or twice around my mother and has referred to me as his kid son very few times as well Scenario with my older sibling I can say anything relatively negative about myself or my appearance Their immediate response is always to tell me I look amazing that day or to stop speaking so negatively I could literally say that my hair looks bad because I haven t showered in almost a week and they would say Your hair looks great I don t know what you re talking about That might not seem like anything much but they have made quite inappropriate comments of my appearance once even told me that they ve had intrusive thoughts of raping molesting physically harming me An example of my mother When I first came out technically for the second time given I came out as trans in fifth grade and again in late 6th early 7th she said she would not be using my chosen name because it would confuse my little sisters and they don t won t understand Whenever it s brought up I m told the same They re too young to understand it will confuse them things like that You have no idea how badly I ve always wanted to tell her that they don t have to understand now because they can respect it now and learn as they get older As for my father One day I was half zoned out at the dinner table My older sibling was at a friend s house that day and the friend s parent had used their my sibling s preferred name I snapped back to reality to hear my dad say Next time I d just say that I don t have a kid named sibling s name but then that makes us the bad guys My mother who was doing the dishes while everyone finished eating agreed with him Younger sister Lacy Just last night we were at my grandma s Unrelated but she did vote for Trump and although very caring and loving I do not think would like me very much if I came out as a masc nonbinary aroace satanist She and my grandpa are very Christian and heavily influenced Lacy after our great grandma s death last year Lacy inherited her Bible She was playing air hockey with he youngest and kept saying certain scores didn t count I was already there with them when Lacy started to get mad at Kira so I stepped in I had only just begun trying to explain that she need to calm down because it was just a game and those scores did count when she went into a full blown tantrum She started screaming and crying that nobody loves her and that I ve never cared about her very random and uncalled for given the fact I only told her that the score counted and even threw her slider at Kira which nearly hit her face She refused to apologize and told our grandma that she hated me when being coaxed to go back upstairs I was sitting on the floor nearby as I was already doing something downstairs when the ordeal had started She never apologized and today acted like nothing happened Youngest Kira Both Lacy and Kira are extremely spoiled Tell them no once and they can go as far as to throw a two hour long tantrum until you cave They were raised to get everything they want which has totally blown up in my parents faces Kira is as I said under five years old and likely autistic I already don t like children for my own reasons side note yeah my parents have said that I ll probably grow out of that stage Spoiler I won t and they won t get grandkids from me regardless but I hold nothing personal against my sisters They can t help that they were raised like brats nor can they help that my mother refuses to try to redeem her shoddy parenting and claims it would be too late or too difficult With the reasonings out of the way I need advice I want to get a job as soon as I can as well as my own card and my own vehicle I do not want to be on my parents insurance or legally connected to them in any way I want to move out by the time I m 18 or 19 but I am aware that it s not particularly realistic This is where I ask for help How where can I find my own source of income What would be the process of getting say a motorcycle under my name only Or finding a vehicle insurance plan I m already good with saving rationing money but any tips for that is definitely welcome Any information or details about becoming a liberated adult that might help or just to be known would be helpful Thanks to all for reading and any advice tips you might have to give",14,Other,

author: Texasnative-89
text body: We are a blended family for context Our children all get along really well and his older kids 18 15 live with us are good kids When his older children were younger their mother was a very unstable person and they lived with her she still is unstable hence why they live with us She traumatized my husband when she would make him do horrible things just to be able to see the kids He was working on getting his green card as he was a DACA recipient and when the program dismantled he was working towards that path She would try to deport him and do all kinds of nasty things when she didn t get her way His children confirm that their bio mom is nuts He joined the military and accelerated that process quite a bit and he was gone a lot She would only let him talk to the kids once a month on a specific day and time If he was busy or at work she didn t care he missed it for the month So he missed a lot of his older children s lives when they were younger He remarried and she had a daughter that he adopted and they had a son together When their marriage went sour due to him being in the military she wrote him a Dear John letter and waited for him to come home from deployment He showed up to a house packed up in a uhaul and his children being rushed out of the state He had to act fast to get an emergency order to keep her in the state and she got out He was devastated and immediately called a lawyer and got to work on that divorce Then COVID hit and his divorce was very delayed He agreed to whatever his ex wife stated in the divorce just to get it off his back With her assuring him he could see his kids on breaks and she would work with him he didn t have her put all of this in writing STUPID When my husband and I got married the younger kids would come and visit and I d always be there at drop off and pick up I met their mother who soon began to REALLY not like me Her daughter and I would have really deep conversations and I d help advise her as best I could She confided in me one day that her mom and new step dad would fight and yell and throw things I asked what she would do and she said take her brother in a room and go hide I was heartbroken So I told her dad and he brushed it off and didn t do anything about it When I asked her the next time she visited how things were going she said that they were still fighting and it was emotionally draining So I told my husband again and again he brushed it off One day the younger kids mom texted me talking crap she had found out that me and her daughter had had talks about love sex boys at a 12 year old level safe sex boundaries etc and just about life in general Her daughter told her she really liked me as a step mom and it infuriated this woman to no end I texted her back after she was talking crap and said something along the lines of your daughter expressed to me that when you fight with your husband in front of the kids it makes her feel unsafe And yeah maybe I shouldn t have gotten in the middle of that but I felt the overwhelming need to bring that to her attention I was nice polite and even expressed it wasn t my place but her daughter was really suffering from this She lost it and called my husband and told him he wouldn t be able to see the kids and swung this elaborate story about what happened Because they had not put more details on the custody in writing he couldn t do much about it She had the control My husband came in a rage and was pissed at me without even asking me what had happened My husband had never yelled at me before never rose his voice in anyone s presence And he SCREAMED at the top of his lungs at me accusing me of being the reason he couldn t see his kids He started to act like a raging lunatic I told him that none of that was true and why would he not ask me my side of the story He left the house and didn t come back for 2 weeks Stayed with a friend and I took care of his two children and my two children I told him he needed to take his ex wife back to court and get a better custody agreement he made every excuse in the book on why he couldn t do that and I was floored When we finally talked it all out in therapy we got to a much better place as far as communication The therapist asked my husband if he would come to one on one session without me he felt he had really deep issue with the fear of not seeing his children that were really concerning He went to two sessions and stopped When I bugged him about it he said hed find a new therapist and start going again He did but never brought up this issue in 6 sessions with them I really don t know what to do I m not going to divorce my husband btw I love him very much But I don t know what to do he s still like this and just flys off the handle if he thinks that he won t get to see his kids It s sometimes a lot It s also noteworthy to say he refuses to show me any affection in front of his younger two kids But in front of the older kids and my kids he s fine with it he won t even hug me when they are around He says he doesn t realize he s doing it and just has total focus on those two kids He doesn t include me or the other kids in the house in what they re doing doesn t tell me what plans are with visiting schedules He also won t update me when the younger kids are having issues or successes they have He looped me 100 out and it hurts When I asked him why he told me he just forgets and I have enough to deal with anyway I would love to be in my step kids lives even as a friend to them but he s literally blocking my relationship with them",,Female,Stepmother

text body: I 20F live in a family of six my mum 52f stepdad 56m and three brothers my twin 20 and 17m and 10m They re all very intense people Like if they have an opinion they will die on that hill I am very non confrontational and tend to prioritize mediation and compromise over proving that I m right For context almost everyone in my household has either had experience with law or is studying that field This makes me the oddball because I m studying to be a veterinarian the first in my entire family that I know of I have one cousin who is a pharmacist and a lot of my family have been cops If I even want to get one word in at all in discussions I have to cut in before anyone else can speak And then no one even regards what I say or tries to convince me I m wrong This is for any topic even ones that I know I have the most knowledge in specifically animals and their wellbeing I am very in tune with animals and can usually accurately predict that something is wrong But then I m rude because I interrupted or got upset at something someone says to me A more specific example was when I was babysitting our dogs while everyone was gone I d given them a toy tire to play with to keep them occupied and my stepdad came home and threw a fit because our younger dog Buddy had chewed it up They re pitbulls it s what they do He d put the half chewed tire away and told me not to give it to them unless he was home so he could make sure they didn t eat the pieces Fine whatever Except I had pointed it out to him that he never communicated with me that they weren t supposed to have that specific toy and I was supervising them the entire time My mum told me I needed to stop trying to start arguments and I got frustrated and left the room I don t really need advice as I have a counselor I plan to talk to I just really needed to get it off my chest I feel so unwelcome in my own home and I know if I bring it up I ll get told to stop trying to be like my friends even though they re all in happy stable homes I m just really at the point of just never saying anything anymore Tl dr I am basically the outcast of my own family",20,Female,daughter

text body: So I dated my baby daddy his name is Gabe When we had our first son we were still together but shortly after my son s birth we just couldn t keep being together At the time we were living with my mom I was barely 18 and he was 19 She kicked him out because we had a very toxic relationship when he moved two and a half hours away he barely had anything to do with our son Cyrus He barely wanted to reach out he never helped out financially he was just a very toxic person to be around Gabe pulled me around saying he loved me and wanted me but then would turn around a few days later and say he didn t want me Fast forward things stayed that way for the first two years of my sons life Gabe acted like a POS and deadbeat still being on and off with me I ended up getting pregnant with my second son after going to visit Gabe my idea not his and just some insight I was off and on with my online boyfriend who was serving in the Marines he was stationed in Japan His name is Seth We started dating off and on online when Cyrus was about three months old yes I regrettably was going between my ex and Seth Seth would FaceTime everyday and talk to me and Cyrus both he was committed to being there in any way he could If I needed help financially he would help me out and would send me money when I didn t have it since I had to be a stay at home most of the time at my mom s house I couldn t hold a job because I couldn t get anyone to watch my son and daycare was too expensive Not that Seth minded helping out when I needed help Gabe never sent any help though and barely ever FaceTimed Cyrus Seth came home a few months after finding out that I was pregnant with my second son he was upset at first and didn t know how to feel But once he got home he came around to the idea of being a dad even if this child wasn t his biologically since he was already considered dad to Cyrus Gabe wanted me to abort my second son and told me multiple times that he only wanted Cyrus and he even told me to blame it on Seth and lie to everyone saying my second son belonged to Seth Seth ended up moving in with me after he got discharged he was there for my pregnancy he was completely supportive he was there for the birth of my second son Aiden He has been everything a dad can be to my two sons ever since he came into our lives We ve been together going on four years we re getting married next month and we have a child of our own Life is good for us Gabe is still a deadbeat he likes to play the victim and tell people he has children and he s a single father even though he lives now four hours away and has nothing to do with his sons He couldn t tell you their favorite color what size clothes they re in he couldn t tell you their medical history or anything He is the definiton of a deadbeat He s told me multiple times that he wants to sign his rights over because it would be better for the kids but at the same time he is demanding to still be apart of their lives after he signs his rights over and let s Seth adopt them I don t know what to do because I don t see how that would be fair to Cyrus and Aiden in any kind of way if you care or love your children you don t sign your rights over You need to be there in their lives but he doesn t want to be a dad to them He just wants to come around when it s convienent for him and only come around once or twice a year It s very toxic It s damaging to Cyrus and Aiden doesn t even know who he is the only dad he has in his eyes is Seth Need advice of what I should do If he signs his rights over I don t think I should allow him to be involved anymore",21,,

text body: 25M here from somewhere in Asia and I m still living with my parents as a single child Since I was a kid I ve always had to deal with my mom She s a foreigner and moved to my country with my dad after I was born After coming to to this country she refused to work saying that her English was terrible and refusing to learn any English or make more friends here hence becoming a housewife She took good care of me and my dad so I respect her decision and I m grateful for her All along however she had always been victimising herself insisting that she was scammed to come to our country with my dad and left her with no choice but to become a housewife and ruining her life hence refusing to work maintaining that it was impossible due to her English and refusing to take any steps to improve her own life even though she deeply laments her financial situation and exhibits very deep financial insecurity My dad has always allowed her to spend any money she wants Thankfully she s thrifty Often times excessively so to the point on skimping on hawker centre meals or simple luxuries well within our means As I ve grown up and slowly become independent it s evident that she has become increasingly insecure She often mentions how filial my cousins living in her home country are even though they stay away from their parents and only visit home once every few months Yet me staying with her every day seems to be the villain and not filial enough often insinuating using my cousins despite taking time almost every day to talk to her eat with her and help her with what she needs She also very often complains how I m not listening to her about how my wings have gotten hard and that I don t need her any more Even as a kid whenever something doesn t go her way she d always threaten Then I ll leave Of course this is the tip of the iceberg Frankly as an adult I can still find the trauma she s left in me in every part of my life Back during COVID she spent a lot of time complaining that my dad and I weren t following her unreasonably strict sometimes outright paranoid hygiene rules and some of that continues even today We went for a family trip last year which for the most part became very ugly due to her and my dad bickering over very petty things and ruining most of the joy Both my parents were in the wrong for the most part This year I decided that I d travel alone and I told my parents about it They weren t opposed to it initially they probably know I really want to do this and don t really care and I booked the trip anyway Subsequently she asked for which dates I m going and I told her to which she has been throwing a huge tantrum chastising me for not consulting with her and abandoning her for the trip I can t understand why I have to consult her for my own travels using my own money She compared me to a cousin who rarely every goes home at all but recently asked her mom for the first time ever whether she d like to go overseas for a trip together I spoke to her sister my aunt who s far more reasonable and she believes that it s her deep insecurity rearing an ugly head based on what she knows of my relationship with my mom She knows how oppressed I ve ever felt due to my mom Thanks for reading this rant If you ve got any advice on what I should do I really appreciate it",25,Male,son

infj I will be straight to the point Me and my older sister looks like we both cut off our relationship already We always argue since we were kids Now reaching almost 30 we just do our own things and never talked and this year marked our 1 year and half not talk to each other after our big fight last year My sister is an ocd person She have this bossy personality every single day and I really cannot tolerate who likes to be bossy and always yapping at anything every single time That s trigger me to quarrelled with her Second story I have one youngest sister who I really love I took care of her since she was a baby whenever I was at home Our age gap is big so ofcourse I love her because I am the youngest before Currently she is in 1st year of high school I took care of her every single time when I was at home I always make childish jokes like a child whenever I was at home eventho I m an adult So last year we both quarrelled then day after I want to apologise to her but she just stay quiet Then after a week I try again Suddenly I started to realised why my youngest sister suddenly became stubborn to forgive me before this not like that After a month I try again and almost everyday for months I apologise to her directly and even buy her things like her birthday presents etc I even cried my eyes out back then because I felt so sad my youngest sister who I love very dearly do not want to speak to me anymore My parents sometimes always give judgemental advice like I always teased her but I said I apologise already and I never cursed her or what I feel sad until now because last 2 years when my parents went to pilgrimage for 7 weeks I am the one taking care of her I even cooked her every single meal if she requested I am free at that time because I took leave for postgraduate study pick her up from school everyday when she heavily sick of fever flu and phlegm I even take care of her at night every single night and full of medicines I bought just to make sure she s fine I always pity her and feel restless whenever she s sick and etc Her beloved sister one that I quarrelled until now never took care of her during that 7 weeks Ofcourse she went to work but during weekend I get angry and told her how come u said u love ur sister but never care for her when she s sick on weekend She always yapping and claiming she s the good one about her buying food and stuff to the youngest but she never care for her when she s sick And it makes me sad because the youngest love her I feel so so so sad because my youngest until now never thought of how I was being so kind to her I even broke down so bad crying like a child of how my relationship with my youngest sister ended now so many times I m now at the age of getting married And every single time when I look back at old photos of me and my youngest sister it broke my heart so so so bad I told my youngest sister Did you resent me because I quarrelled with ur beloved sister And She just quiet I told her You should not get involved with my issue with ur sister because we both always quarrelled since we were kids Nothing can save that These things happened even before u were born But as always she just quiet Deep down in my heart I could sense my youngest hate me I don t know why she hate me My personality always act of service to people I love and this hurt me so much I even helped my youngest sister when she was a kid she stuck her finger near sardine can cap and I helped her eventho there were my parents and her beloved sister I quickly went to help her when I heard her cry so loud Ends up my finger bleed so much after helping her with that sardine cap because I got scraped with that can I don t know from who I could get help I don t want to improve my relationship with my sister but I just want to be friend with my youngest sister back It broke me every single day living in the same house where u want to play childhood games and chatting with ur sister but nothing the same anymore My mom even cried sometimes because youngest do not want to friend with me anymore I cried so loud like a kid in front of my mom It s already 1 year When she want to talk to me My dad always say be patience I said it s already a year Then what After she turns 20 I m already old Who knows when I will get married in future I cried so loud because I keep thinking I won t have any recent memories with her anymore My youngest did not even remember why she so angry with me until today I even said I will buy her favourite things to her if she forgive me but she did not budged Deep down I think her beloved sister brainwash her not to friend with me anymore Mark my words she s a gaslighting person The worst one I even caught her message my youngest sister when we went back to hometown she cannot follow because of work She asked her is she talking to you U friend with her When I came back to our home at city I shouted so loud in front of her face Why meddle with my issue with my youngest u gaslight her behind my back My sis just stay quiet I told her once more I caught you you know what I will do Because I never meddle with her life After a year now I feel so miserable with my postgraduate study with my parents attitude my dad always scolding me or talk harshly even when I talk kindly and my sadness of my youngest sister not friend with me anymore If someone could give me advice how I want to be friend with her back Even writing this I cry so bad again Note my argument with my youngest sister back then was just like child argument like quarrelled over ice cream that kind of level Not like adult level T T Even until now evetho she don t speak to me I sometimes helped her to buy food whenever my parents not at home I even make small talk everyday but ofcourse she didn t answer It s like I m talking to a wall This week I even buy birthday card with music and gift to my youngest sister because it s her birthday soon I am planning to write down sincere nice words to her if she want to be my friend again But I don t know anymore if I should do that T T I m afraid I will be broken so hard if she just stay like that even after giving

text body: Hello I don t know if I posted in the right topic but I just need advice because I don t know what to do My sister and I in out 20s I am the older one out of the both of us Our relationship has always been in waves of bad and good moments I am not affectionate with her I m not sure why but I just never been one to hug her often or say I love you often However I am always there for her when she needs help or wants me to just hear her out She does put a lot of effort in our relationship but struggle to do the same So much so it frustrates her I don t want to get into too much detail because she does go on Reddit and I don t want her to know about this post We used to argue like regular siblings but I feel like it has been becoming a bit much lately I know I should try to be the bigger person since I m older but sometimes my emotions get the better of me Sometimes she says does certain things and it causes me to defensive which in turn causes her to be more defensive I try to remove myself from our arguments because of my unstable emotions I often need to get myself out of that situation so I can let my emotions ride out calm down and I can try to think with a clear head regarding what happened The last thing I want to do is hurt her Whenever our arguments escalate she tells me that I am the cause of our arguments getting worse She says I always try to be in the right in our arguments She tells me I try to make her look bad or that I always have a bad attitude with her I do admit that recently I think I am the cause of our fights getting intense and it s because I haven t been backing down She sometimes picks unnecessary fights and creates something out of nothing I feel like always do wrong in her eyes whenever we argue I can t defend myself I can t tell her what she said was hurtful I can t leave the argument to try to collect myself If someone is in the middle of our argument and if they show their on my side in the slightest then they are also in the wrong and they re enabling me to treat her bad She always tells me that I am the favorite when it comes to my older siblings and parents How she is always in the wrong in their eyes How they enable me to be horrible towards her Idk maybe what she s says about me is true I m not best person I have my flaws and I wish I reflected back the same affection she has for me I am stumped on what to do I am trying not to fight back in our arguments but it s a bit hard for me to hold back lately I feel like it s mostly fights instead of good memories I do try to talk to her about it but it just ends up in an argument Either she doesn t agree with what I say or hear me out Or I say something that sets her off Is it me Should I just seek help or idk something Also I ll probably delete this post later I really don t want her to see it because I feel like another argument will happen Any criticism or advice is helpful Maybe I m just not seeing what she is seeing",20,,sibling

text body: Hi Reddit community This is my first post until now i was only reading on Reddit I am in need of advice from community now A bit of background information first I am the oldest Sister of 3 Siblings Have a 4 years younger brother and a 5 years younger sister So back then as kids I was less close to both because of the age gap but the two were pretty close as they also shared rooms for a long time I moved out rather soonish from home for studying but both siblings stayed much longer at home With my brother it was always a bit more complicated Since i can remember he always had the feeling that he was treated unfairly compared to his two sisters Cannot judge honestly because as a child you just dont see those things clearly While growing up my brother kept being a complicated person who is easily triggered by things you cannot anticipate taking many non personal things extremely personally like talking about some random facts and if you say it is different from what he said he snaps This lead to that most family members avoid any confrontation with him including me Now we are all in our 30ies and the issue persists He is living a quite isolated life and it is really hard getting close to him I don t even know if he has any friends besides the online friends We got into fights multiple times because of how he communicates or not communicates with me and other family members He is often rude and blames everybody else for things he doesnt like Example my mum and him booked holidays he agreed on all destination hotel etc But the moment they are there he complains about everything and blames my mum and me who isnt even there because we were there many years ago and said the food is good But he doesn t like it so he shouldn t have agreed on this whole trip Because also there is nothing to do what he likes But he also didnt spend a minute on research where he wants to spend his holidays I am often worried that he is so isolated that he gets weirder and weirder every year Maybe he is depressed and I dont know how to help him or even start the topic without him rushing out of the room angry I hope someone has some advice how i could handle the situation I love my brother but he is really having issues and i feel he needs some support Thanks for reading",33,Female,Sister

text body: okay so i m not sure how to start this but i think my mom killed my dad yeah i know sounds insane and i have no proof of this but i just have a feeling which i know is not enough to accuse my own mother for something horrible my first cousin i think maybe last year said oh what if your mom killed your dad for context we were watching a documentary with my second cousin and my sister it was called american murder the family next door I didn t say anything back neither did my sister i didn t really know what to say i guess it was just so specific i think in that moment it really got me thinking what if my mom did kill my dad present time sunday i went on safari and searched my mom s name and my dad s and a lot came up i was on a website called truthfinder com and found my mom s full first name and did a lot to go a report they call it and i was interested in seeing criminal records or anything i could find i found a lot like duis and dwis records photos and videos inmate records and the one that scares me the most in the process of getting the report was registered sex offenders not sure what that means but i can only hope that it just offenders that live in the area and it has nothing to do with my family i also looked at the relatives and found my mom s sister s name on there i also found a court case i think my mom was in or is currently in i searched up my mom s name and court after it and the first link was someone i didn t know v my mom and i was scrolling looking the the updates and what had happened this is what i found out on october 24th 2018 consoildated edison company of new york inc filed a property repossession lawsuit against my mother and someone by the name of john roe and jane it was filed in queens county courts queens county civil court located in queens new york the status of the case was disposed that was a summary of what happened the judge was someone named timothy j dufficy and the plaintiff being someone named hansrajie payne and the defendant being my mother and father or rather it s says on unicourt my mother s full name individually and executrix of estate of my father s full name the plaintiff attorney was someone named friedman daniel and i m not sure who was my mother s and father s attorney or if they even had one the thing that gets me is that this takes place in 2018 but my father passed 2017 on the 24th of june i fins really weird cause why is my father in a court case when he isn t even alive i don t know i think he was born november 4th 1964 and i say i think because he died when my sister and i were really young i was born in february 2008 and my sister the year after in may i know this because i had also searched up my dad s name and found an obituary online for him and that s all i could find on him which the day he died would make sense cause i remember being at the at the school year and in was during the summer the two websites i found it on was tributearchive com and kearnsfamily com now it s likely that these are different people but i can t help but to feel that it is my father and i feel the the date and what i remember match that s what i found about them on the internet also on truthfinder i couldn t get the report because i would have pay for it and i didn t want to do that now time to get into my childhood and how i lived these past years my father was definitely not a good person he would picks fights yell and would hit my sister and i i don t want to get into that too much because every time i think about it i cry i feel like my mom knew but didn t say anything or didn t care or both it really fucked up my sister and i s lives when my father passed which for starters i don t even know what he passed from i always thought it was from cancer like liver cancer or lung cancer i mostly thought it was liver cancer but anyways when he passed my mother i think she had some sort of mental breakdown she would hit me i don t remember if she hit my sister except for one time she told me she would yell and just be very distant still is now her relationship with us is very strained after he passed well let s be honest it wouldn t have been good other wise she would buys things for us anything we wanted and she thinks that s building some type of relationship and making up for what she has done and what my father has done my father didn t want to buy anything for us for some reason and i think my mother is making that up by buying things for us and well killing him we don t spend time with each other we stay in ours staring at our screens it s sad but now when i think about spending time with each other feels weird to me my mom said that he changed our father but i don t think he changed the same when he was a kid and teenager an adult a husband a father a brother if he changed why would he do this to us i don t wanna get into it i already just cried a little my mother is emotionally unavailable i don t confide in her or anything our relationship is surface level now onto to the part where i suspect that my mother killed my father i feel like she knew he hit us and yelled at us a lot and didn t really buy anything for us like expensive stuff for us i don t know why but i think she might ve killed him because of that like she feels guilty but i don t know because she has hit me and my sister too so it doesn t make sense to why she would feel guilty a few moths after my dad passed my mom cut contact with my dad s side of the family we don t speak to them anymore i don t if this is all true or not i let curiosity get the best of me and i found a lot of the internet and i don t know if i ll ever get the answer i m looking for and figure out the truth i feel as if there s a lot more to discover about this family i wish i didn t look up their names but as the same time i m glad i did otherwise i would ve never known but this feelings will always haunt me even if i get the answer i m looking for i don t want to share my father and mother names because i afraid that someone i know a family member and someone that someone that knows my father might see this however none of which i know use reddit or i don t they use it eh it s risky i don t think i m gonna do it even though it ll help a lot i m sorry about that i don t have the answer to most things because my brain has hidden memories and most of the time i can t remember what happen before or after the event i think this is caused by the traumas in my life let me know if you find anything or what you think about this i would be so grateful to

text body: Warnings mentions of sexual abuse pedos incest So for background information I told my father whom im estranged to now back in i think 2023 2024 about my grandfather molesting me when I realized it would be revealed as my dad was looking through his ex fiance s messages off topic story and he ended up calling the immediately family first my grandma then my grandfather then my aunt All of which were of course confused and shooken Why would she say something like that is my grandma s exact words And ofc there was denying and whatever Ended up with me telling the story five times This is how it goes although warning it happened a while back and my brain is foggy because I was trying my hardest to forget about it and believe my grandfather didn t mean bad by it Also because me my siblings and dad all were living in an RV on my grandpa s property and srsly relied on him so I felt like I couldnt say anything But anyway it was back when I was 14 im currently 18 turning 19 when the first time it happened We were alone it was snowing heavily down by the garage and my grandfather was talking about me needing more love he s aware my father is abusive and mother out of the picture And so he was behind me and hugged me from behind which isnt too odd until he had his face in my neck and putting his arms up my shirt and jacket and groped my chest Ofc I was shocked and froze not knowing what to do Mind you I was never given a talk the most talk I ever got was to not talk to strangers I was really good at pretending though and he d asked me are you okay I think Mind you Im also reveiwing when i told my online ex best friend like a month after it happened bc i was scared to even tell my online friends But i replied with eh No not really like in a quiet voice and sorta walked off I cant remember too well but between the first time and the last time he has always been a bit too open with sex talk or would sometimes grope me a little or maybe press himself a bit too much when we rode the quad I tried my hardest to not act differently I think it was because i didnt want to get into trouble i always remember feeling like i was gonna get caught lying or smth However at some point grandpa hadnt done it in a while and i thought that i could forget and move on But i stupidly thought that didnt knock on wood obviously on the same day last day we went driving And he was a good teacher gentle and nice but on this drive things got crazy And no i havent gotten past my self blame stage even if i try to deny it so here goes im 15 at this point turning 16 That day i was practicing driving till we got to the town where grandpa took over and we went to get some ice so while we got some we messed around a bit and i put ice down his shirt cause im stupid and was having fun But then he said ho ho just wait im going to get you wet and ofc at first i didnt think about it in thattt way Then i did I remember how my body went cold and i was uncomfortable But i went on and drove Drove till grandpa wanted a smoke break and and we parked at this vet park we stopped at a couple times before While at the rest stop i dont remember a lot but i remember his tickling me and at first it was playful but then he held me down with my back on the middle console as im sitting in the driver seat his elbow keeping my torso down he does a lot of maual labor hes stronger than me im just a chubby girl and he ended up slipping his hands under into my pants and touched me for a couple of seconds I tried to kick and say no multiple times screaming it My instincts kicked in though ofc and he got off me and was laughing and i was too Trying to laugh at least even when i was tearing up I pretended like nothing happened and drove back home Ended up sobbing in the Rv then doing what i usually did Pretending So after i told my dad he was a child about it and used the fact i didnt trust him enough to tell him but told his ex fiance to maybe keep him away bc he visited our new home in every argument we have that we moved in a couple of months after grandpa molested me last He a couple times also almost nearly said i lost my relationship with my father because ofc you can assume what he would say next as he always loved to compare me to my maniulative psychotic mother Always calling me a liar yet swears up and down he believes me about my grandpa Which doesnt mean anything to me because they have a sour relationship based on codependency and drugs that always ends up with hate My dad talked shit about everyone in the family teaching me and my sisters no one else loves us or can care for us So we believed him because no one reached out Not the point the point of this post is with the information i give you and am happy to answer questions is how i should react to my families response to this all since i have moved out from my fathers place after a desperate call to my aunt for help after the millionth time my dad threatened to kick me out because well thats also another story but lets just say its money he wants A lot of it But yes im living with my aunt now a girl who spent middle and high school online So social skills are 0 Basically my aunt chooses to not talk about it I forgot what she exactly said but its like she is choosing to side step it Shes got enough drama and I m very grateful to her But so she has informed after the talks we have had which is the first time i was able to have a normal 2 sided talk with someone without being screamed at And she told me how my grandpa has been doing drugs for a long time probably with my dad too But my grandpa mainly did weed and she beleives that my grandpa wouldnt be capable of doing what he did to me without the drugs messing up his brain Which i totally understand where she could think that because i seriously loved my grandpa he was my rock and ended up becoming a boulder rolling onto me Very ill relationship with driving now and my body She also makes it a point that pedos would be noticed from a younger age than how old he is That he wouldve started with her his daughter and by no means did i agree with this But ofc i love my aunt and all that we dont need to agree with everything but she does not wish to say whether she does or doesnt believe me And instead insists that the matter is one to simply not speak of I should also mention she was molested by a rando when she was younger and thats why i felt like she may relate But i have discovered incest feels much different Anyway my aunt still talks to my grandma and grandpa grandma still lives with him and they all seem fine Like nothing has ever happened Heard his voice a couple times and it made me ill i cover photos on the fridge with my grandpas face in it with magnets I try to avoid him completely but the reason i was having a discussion with my aunt to begin with was because she was trying to advise me to talk to my grandma especially bc she didnt dk anything to hurt me Cant go on to tell my aunt my grandma used to make snide comments to me and my little sister about our chubbiness Never did it to the middle sis shes skinny i cant stack on smth else thats hearsay although my sis would attest The issue is i have decided to not speak to my grandma but after my aunt put me in a situation where i had to speak to her showing my art while on videocall even though i said no theb showing me she thinks that im fine with it now and has bombarded me twice since and i try to be polite but worried my grandpa is listening Before this abd the convo i always went upstairs when i heard their voice and refused to speak and aunt did a good job saying i wasnt feeling well or doing smth I appreciate her for understanding But she also doesnt want me saying anything about my grandpa or setting boundaries if i were to talk to her Which i think first is a red sign second my aunt lied to me too After my aunt and her fought over the painting my aunt told me that my grandma offered 50 but i overheard her talking to her friend and said her dad offered it Which makes me feel like i cant trust her or my grandma about this situation Next thing i know she will try tk get me to talk to my grandpa which i brought up to ny aunt but she quickly said she wouldnt It makes my blood boil thinking about how grandfather got away scott free and no one else knows like its a hush hush situation I just dont know what to do I hate keeping the peace abd my family is the kind to say family comes first but it literaly never does to them All i know is my cousin tiny boy has seen him multiple times even after everything was revealed which is smth that angers me to the point of snapping especially because i saw them on a quad which ny grandpa was a bit touchy a couple times on and is one of the photos on the fridge Like shes risking her son Also uou should know my grandpa and dad have the same name and once when i was around 14 before my dad got a call about some sexual assult on a girl and he was with his ex fiance then gf and very confused which he mentioned later on when i admitted everything but also his ex fiance told me before he did Also beterrn the time i admitted what happened and when i called my aunt to help i didnt get much contact from my family less than before was alr little Thats it rlly would appreciate feedback Thanks and sorry for the long post I got away from my dad though hope yall take that as a sign that things can turn around for the better",18,Female,Granddaughter

text body: So recently my aunt passed I was supposed to meet with my father the day she passed to talk about my wedding plans in Vegas I m not a big fan of planning weddings or marriages in Vegas but it was my dad s idea and he seemed excited so I was too He was kind of pushing me to go through with it because he got married to a new woman in Vegas a year ago and they would be celebrating their 1 year anniversary at the same time She seems nice but I don t know her that well yet I didn t bother bringing up the wedding plans when we were supposed to meet because I knew this was a time of mourning for the rest of my family He had actually told me the day before my aunt died that she was in the hospital I was taking an exam at the time so when he texted me that she had been hospitalized I just responded with okay In the past I have gone to the hospital to visit her when she would get sick but I always felt like her kids hated me and didn t want me around especially my aunt She was never nice to me and she was always very cruel to me and my mother Her kids always ignored me and shunned me so I never ever felt like I was wanted in their family So when my dad told me she was very ill again she lived with Lupus I didn t know what to do or say After that I think my dad took it the wrong way and completely ignored me He s divorced from my mother but he ended up calling and telling her that she passed so I had to hear it from my mom I texted my dad and called him but he never responded I think that he was doing this to justify the fact that he was upset because I didn t go visit my aunt at the hospital or my cousins but he didnt even bother to tell me what hospital she was in when he texted me initially I guess he expected me to ask I also felt like it was my aunt s children that needed to make peace with her because they were estranged from her for while and I would just be some unwanted nuisance I have never talked bad about my aunt and cousins but my father has I dont think he really even like his own sister either Maybe he did love her but I could never tell because of the way he spoke badly about her and her husband I did pay my respects at the funeral but I ve always had issues with all my relatives They talk about me spread rumors and some of these relatives shunned me as a child and never got to know me All because I was raised by my grandmother and they hated her This isn t the first time that my dad has given me the cold shoulder either When I was young he would go weeks months and the longest a year without speaking to me He would blame me for not wanting to be around him but he cheated on my mom openly and would verbally abuse her and I I respected him feared him looked up to him but I was never close to him and I m his only child Now that I m older and I have my son and partner I realize how much it s affected me I m anxious reclusive and I tend to push people away I do feel like it s my fault for not showing up and seeing my family but I get such intense anxiety around them that it literally makes me sick I have no siblings and a mom that really depends on me She s never been on her own and she s lived with my partner and I for the past 10 years maybe more on and off She has a lot of built up trauma and she needs a lot of help doing anything Not because shes sick or weak but because she doesn t want to do anything for herself Not having parents that are supportive and having no family to go to has really messed with my mind lately I don t know what to do It s opened up an inner wound that I ve had as a child I know that if I try to reach out to my dad again I m only going to get a cold response He basically ignored me at the funeral so I reciprocated the same My father also had the audacity to talk to my husband when I walked away at the funeral and asked him if we were ready and excited to go to Vegas and get married My partner doesn t like the idea because his family is not even going to be able to be a part of it They can t afford to go to vegas and to be honest neither can we We were actually discussing what we were going to tell my dad before all of this happened but when my husband told him that we weren t interested in going to Vegas at the funeral he just got up and walked away He hadn t even spoken to me the entire time he just gave me a hug and said hello Right after the funeral him and his wife went on a mini vacation And I mean immediately after the funeral There s so many conflicting feelings inside me because I love my father but I m very tired of feeling so guilty and taking the blame for every little incident I already felt disconnected from the rest of my family because like I said they can be cruel for no reason I ve always been a shy and timid person and my father hates that but I can t help it I m a grown woman with almost no confidence sometimes and something is constantly tormenting me inside Should I talk to him Is this my fault What should I do Sorry this is so long",,,daughter

text body: Please read part 1 and 2 for context Apologies for the length of the post but it s 14 years cramped into 3 posts What could my brother do at this point Knowing his former bunk mate and his wife were cheating in front of him Take a drive to Separationville At this point my brother started sleeping in Rio s room My brother wasn t saying much but I was keeping up with Lilly on social media Months had gone by and things were very strained so much so that Bernie had gone to stay with Cassie and Laura Cassie and Laura were going through the beginning of the end of their marriage as well Cassie realized that Lilly was playing with her feelings and her pocket Laura was falling in love with Lilly Lilly was promising a relationship with her Laura was essentially paying for anything Lilly wanted Now we are entering 2023 around February Lilly decided to go away with a friend to Seattle Who s in Seattle Mike and his wife Lilly had kept sending Mike spicy messages throughout the year and wanted to see him to make things happen What she wasn t counting on was Mike sharing the spicy messages with his wife Needless to say Mike s wife shut that down if you saw Lilly s posts and pics from that weekend she looked so sad and I almost felt bad for her but I would speak to my brother and know that this is the universe s repayment In June Bernie officially moved out of Cassie and Laura s house and embarks on his own journey moves into his own place and finds his first post military job During the time of the separation my brother was being an exemplary father to his children while being a supportive and encouraging person to the mother of his children while trying to figure out himself October comes by Lilly and Laura take a trip to Atlanta This trip was meant for Lilly to hook up with a childhood friend that she was fantasizing about which never happened Early November Bernie lost his job due to him being careless He came home for a week to advise us that they were getting a divorce and needed to be around people who loved him He goes back to California and one afternoon in which he s babysitting she s accusing him of sleeping around so much so that he spiraled downwards and ultimately ended up at the mental hospital Guess who decided to go to the courthouse to file for divorce while Bernie was having a 5150 You guessed it Lilly Lilly wanted to make sure it was her that did it She had been manifesting it for years during our car rides she would say when me and your brother get divorced we re going to be the best of friends She has been scripting the story y all Bernie went back to his apartment and started making the moves necessary to leave for himself he needed to get rid of her Unfortunately it also means leaving the kids Three souls that have done absolutely nothing wrong and have to lose out on the one parent that cares the one parent that wants to parent March 2024 Bernie headed East and went home with his dog in tow We received him with all of the support love and care that can be given and received During one of our many conversations he shares that Mario and Stacy are divorced Laura and Cassie are divorced My parents have given him the space to be who he wants to be and become Since then the divorce has been finalized Bernie has been out to California countless times for weeks to take care of the kids while his ex wife has vacations or work trips It s hindering him from getting an actual job Just as he started school in August she needed him to take off for a couple of days so she can vacation In October he had to take a leave of absence so he could help her move and drive across the country to the East Coast In the 4 months they ve been living there my brother has been there at least three times a month She wants him back Her actions are of someone that wants her husband back She constantly calls him with a new emergency in which he drops everything including school and drives down This last weekend we asked him to stay home so that he can spend time with some family that wanted to see him because my brother is a really cool guy when he s mentally in it She had put him so much through the emotional wringer that he couldn t be present for anyone and locked himself in his bedroom Last night his location was at school NJ at 5pm and then check his locations at 6am today and he s in NC At this point she is giving unfit parent that can t deal with tween twin attitudes and a young boy that is now on 2 tablets over stimming his mind She is not mentally stable to deal with three autistic children and is making him mentally unstable I m afraid of what my brother might do because of her manipulative behavior What can I say This is my biggest heartbreak This is one of the most painful stories that I ve ever witnessed A woman that has torn 3 families apart incapacitated 3 kids all because she can t get over herself I ve told my brother to document everything and take her to family court and set clear boundaries He caves in to her wishes and commands because she ll cut communication with the kids She s done it to me before plenty of times that s why I don t talk to her My feelings for her have layers they range from anger to love and back to rage What would you do with someone like this in your life What kind of advice do you give my brother about regaining custody and improving these kids lives",,,sibling

text body: Please read part 1 for context Apologies for the length It s 14 years broken up into 2 3 posts Shortly after this we find out that all three kids have Autism with time it was determined that they are also non verbal California is deemed as one of the best states to live in to receive services for children with autism Early on in their diagnosis they were getting the proper behavioral occupational therapy needed to grow Rio since the age of 2 wakes up with a tablet in his hands and doesn t let it go until he falls asleep The girls are partial to a tablet but are into imaginative play puzzles The occupational therapists would go to the house and teach the kids in their environment one day one of these therapists saw Lilly hit one of the girls and called CPS as she s required to This infuriated Lilly and changed companies As this is going on with the kids Lilly started working for herself selling leggings Avon anything that she can do from home made some friends getting acclimated to her surroundings My brother is encountered with his first big deployment and he s gone for 8 9 months At this time I was going through a major mental health crisis and decided to leave home and go to California to both look for work start a new life and help with the kids Lilly gave me 8 weeks to get my act together They were living in a four bedroom three bathroom house on base just guess where I was placed IN THE GARAGE I would travel to the big city on Monday and walk to different salons retail stores looking for work I would stay in hostels and eat one meal a day to make my money stretch The only thing I would allow myself to enjoy is some pot both to help me relax and take my mind off of things This was something that she hated and would constantly start fights with me regarding my pot use which back then would be a hit or two and then go about my business I was broke and had to make it last Around week 3 of my stay she was getting very antsy constantly complaining about her neighbors and told my brother that she had to move out of the military housing Week 4 of my stay she advises me that she found a place and that we would be moving within the next 2 weeks This new place was a two bedroom single bathroom house where she said without using words get out I help her pack everything Then came the weekend of the move Lilly recruited another married couple Stacy and Mario that her and Bernie befriended to help with the move I would do trips to the new house with the kids and be their babysitter while Lilly and the married couple would move everything else Unbeknown to me the wife would stay home and take care of their baby that means that Lilly and Mario husband of the friend were left alone to move She put the moves on him and they smashed This is the first of many marriages she will ultimately destroy I left two weeks later because I was tired of her my morale was low due to constant rejections from job interviews After the move the kids were still receiving their services my brother came home and everything was good from outside looking in I was happy that my brother had found a military friend because he doesn t make friends easily I was content in knowing that they were in a good spot Six months living in this new space they have to move Why you ask Apparently she was receiving social services payments and was going to have them revoked because they were receiving extra income to pay for their housing outside of the military base So now we move back into military housing Remember Lilly having weight loss surgery well she lost 120lbs She s weighing in on a healthy 145 lbs and is feeling herself saggy skin and all At this time she decided to go on an app to make friends because she is feeling lonely She meets and befriends Mike Mike is 6 6 280 300 lbs he s a MARRIED guy with a big heart Mike not only befriends Lilly he befriends my brother as well As Covid is starting in the United States I take a trip out to California to see everyone the world is yet to be shutdown March 2020 happens and the world is shut down We are all living in our bubbles My brother is placed on leave because my nephew has asthma and the military had very strong precautions with people with lung illnesses In May my brother goes back to work and he s faced with his second deployment set to leave in June Lilly is set to have cosmetic surgery in July to take off the excess skin and get breast implants So who is there to take care of the kids I have gone back to work and my job had a strict travel policy in place so it wasn t me My parents are older and refused to travel so it wasn t them The care of the kids was placed on Stacy Mario and Mike Who was taking care of Lilly while she was recovering A very married Mike Bernie s deployment was cut short and was home for the holidays Me and my parents decided to go to Bernie s for Christmas because they hadn t traveled in all of 2020 and genuinely missed him and the kids In this trip we meet Laura and Cassie they are a lesbian married couple that Lilly befriended that lived around the corner There was something about them I wasn t too crazy about Weeks earlier Stacy and Mario had a falling out with Lilly and Bernie due to the fact that Stacy s dog attacked Lilly s cat while dog sitting ultimately that cat had to be put down but the friendship was already strained due to Stacy confronting Lilly about how she parents her children Let s touch on Lilly s parenting she does just enough to not get CPS called on her The girls will go days without brushing their hair she feeds them simple quick things so she doesn t have to put much effort into cooking She believes that these kids are normal and one day they ll be normal Yes they are normal to me and to our family because we ve embraced whatever form of communication they can give us She praises her own parenting online as I go so hard for my kids looking and seeking for the reaffirmation of other people that don t personally know how she parents CPS has called on her two more times because of how the children arrive to school and about something more personal that I don t feel comfortable discussing She also uses these kids to help her promote her online boutique which bothers me immensely In January of 21 Bernie and Lilly decided to open up their relationship to include Laura and Cassie They did the deed Bernie was ok with the terms Lilly not so much She loved the attention she was receiving from everyone Cassie was falling in love with Lilly Laura was developing a deep friendship with Lilly Bernie was starting to get inklings that this wasn t healthy and that it was time for them to move and have a fresh start In April they purchased their first home almost two hours away from the military base Bernie was going through some transitions at work that was causing him to be away for 4 6 weeks He asked me to be a great sister and help with the move At the same time I was leaving my job and felt it was the perfect time to spend 2 3 weeks in California So I arrive and catch Cassie making out with Lilly in the old house I approach Lilly and she said that they are spicy sleep partners and that it s ok As the days go by Cassie is doing everything a woman that s pursuing someone would do Lilly was having a bad day she was DOORDASHING her favorite treats and flowers Later I would point it out to Laura that this was going on I was tired of seeing them they lived two hours away and yet they were there everyday On weekends they would sleepover and play blended family Lilly thought she was having her cake and eating it as well I called my brother and unleashed everything that was going on he ignored what I was saying A couple of days later I approached Lilly about this and told her about herself The following day she had a mental breakdown that caused my brother to come home early even though he wasn t supposed to Six months later Cassie and Laura follow Lilly and Bernie and move 8 minutes away Unlike Cassie and Laura the one thing that didn t follow the family was the additional therapy the children were receiving Lilly was only depending on the education the kids were receiving at school Lilly swears that she reinforces what the children learn at school at home but she doesn t she hands them tablets so they don t bother her I promise we re getting close to the end but this is where it gets good Bernie decided that he had enough of the military full time and it was time to leave it he put in his paperwork and by June of 2022 he was out Lilly had decided to throw him a party for his retirement She invited the girls a couple of other couple friends they made and a couple of guys from my brother s unit Apparently she had one guy in particular as a friend Chad If you re asking where Mike is he went back to his home state to work things out with his wife Before the party Chad had purchased a new car and picked it up the day of the party Chad arrived at the party and was so excited to show off his new car He asked my brother to take pics of him and the new car on his phone Chad hands over his phone over to my brother to take pics while he is taking pictures who is to send spicy pictures You guessed it Lilly Chad expressed to my brother that he and Lilly were sending spicy messages and wanted to see what she was all about due to their open marriage situation Bernie asked Lilly if this was what she wanted and she said yes With that said Lilly was having a spicy mambo while my brother took Chad s new car on a ride and rode through all the red lights and tolls possible Needless to say this was the beginning of the end",,,sibling

text body: This story begins roughly 13 14 years ago dates elude me because I have smoked a lot of pot and also trauma blocked moments in time This story isn t about me this story is about my brother his kids and his narcissistic ex wife I apologize in advance for the novel For context I am 40 years old single with no kids so I really try to stay out of married people s messes and really try to avoid giving parenting advice My brother is now 37 we come from an old school Caribbean Latin household in which mom is very much a narcissistic person in a good and bad way smother mother I do carry some of these tendencies but between therapy and doing shadow work I have been more of the soundboard of common sense in all of this My brother on the other hand is a severe people pleaser My brother Bernie started dating his now ex wife that we will call Lilly 14 years ago Lilly was my brother s first everything at 22 years old He was not her first everything As they dated she made all of her red flags visible Controlling manipulative jealous self centered but great girl overall insert eye roll A year into this relationship my brother decided to join the military because he tried the school thing he was working a dead end job where he was constantly overlooked for promotions Bernie is my favorite person in the whole wide world I wasn t opposed to this move for him because I knew the doors of opportunity that this decision would have led to He left to bootcamp and he would write letters to Lilly me and our parents During this time we hadn t heard from Lilly I didn t care one bit I frankly hated her then She hated us then because she was and is very insecure she was heavy set and felt that we would make fun of her My brother is a very good looking guy but due to childhood teasing he feels he s an ugly duckling I saw everything that was wrong with her at 18 years old Time for Bernie to graduate from bootcamp and he informed us that Lilly wanted to go with us It was a 14 hour drive going to the military base he was at and during that 14 hour drive she took any and every opportunity to tell us how sick she s feeling and how she has no insurance to pay for her medical bills Graduation happened and then we drove back home with our new service member At this point it was a 16 hour drive back home hearing the same complaints all over again By hour 11 I pulled over and threatened to leave her on the side of the road if she didn t stop complaining She toned it down for the rest of the ride The military here pays more to their service members if they are married They felt it was best to get married during the break he got in between bootcamp and his first station They didn t inform anyone on our end because he knew how temperamental both me and my mother were at the time She told her aunts and went to lunch after their courthouse ceremony The day he got married he went out clubbing with me to celebrate our joint birthdays Lilly didn t come because she was 18 The day they decided to get married was 4 days before my birth date He then leaves to his actual first station My actual birthday was the day after he left for his station on this day Lilly shoots me a text Happy Birthday Sissy I responded Thank you for the birthday wishes but please don t call me sissy I am not your sister She came back with oh yes you are Me and your brother got married on Friday so you re my sissy in law I saw red I destroyed all of his Lego sets he had built and cried For the next couple of months Lilly is attending college and my brother is in his first station learning the job he s going to be doing for the military My brother visits for the holidays and informs us that his second station is going to be Alaska At this point Lilly is going with him to this new station and officially start their lives as a married couple Not even 6 months into this move Lilly felt a need to move her coworker into their apartment to save costs because she wanted to live outside of the military base Lily s grandmother passed away and I paid for the emergency flight home During this time the coworker was trying to make moves on Bernie but he only had eyes for his wife Being that Lilly was staying out here longer than expected the coworker was only getting more aggressive with her approaches and forced Bernie to get his superiors involved and wrote him a letter to get out of his lease and into military housing A year later they had a set of the most beautiful twin girls Moon and Sky that I had ever set my eyes on of course they look just like me I flew out to meet my girls Lilly felt the need to gatekeep pictures videos anything that an aunt and grandparents would want of the babies because they were HER KIDS Six months later they travel to us with the girls and I m just ever so in love with them Unbeknown to me they were having marital problems and something my mom said to her had made things worse When they arrived back to Alaska they were at the point of separation They decided to have a date night to talk things through one drink led to another which led to spicy sleep which ended up being the conception of my nephew That following January my nephew was born he was born with some physical impairments that needed immediate attention in order for him to walk properly In the month after Rio was born I flew out to meet him The week after I was there my parents flew out to meet their grandson and to help with the girls During this time my mom saw odd behavior from Lilly whenever my brother s friends would come over she would wear skimpy shorts and flirt with them My mom would call me whenever her and my dad would go on a walk so that she could tell me what was going on One day she called me crying because Lilly took a cute picture of Bernie with the girls and Lilly refused to text it to her because she didn t want to Lilly told my brother a different story and ultimately my brother asked my mom to apologize to Lilly because she upset her Wild right But wait there s more At this point my brother was in the military for 4 5 years and was going to renew his contract and with this came a move You couldn t even imagine the level of excitement that I had that my four most favorite people were moving within the lower 48 states During this time Lilly gets gastric bypass to help with weight loss and other health issues that she has My brother and his wife felt it was the right time to get the children baptized a week before the twins fourth birthday We all flew out her side his side That weekend was a beautiful weekend but it was going almost too well to be true My mom is the type that if she spent money on something she will let you know that she did it and how much was spent My mom expressed to Lilly s grandmother how much she spent on the souvenirs and how she schlepped them cross country which apparently got under Lilly s skin That Tuesday we were supposed to go from the hotel to the house and spend the rest of the week with them On Tuesday we arrive at the house and I m in my own world in the middle of the afternoon my mom says something to Lilly about maintaining the house clean or something about the kids and Lilly loses it Lilly yelled at my brother cursed and yelled at my parents eventually kicking them out My brother left because he couldn t deal with it I took my parents to the airport and took myself to a hotel My parents trip was cut short by 4 days and lost additional money on emergency flights back home I was in town for an additional couple of days because I had business in the state later on in the week Ultimately after that week the relationship between Lilly and my parents changed to this day my mom refuses to bring anything up to her because of the harm she may do to the kids and my brother",40,,sibling

text body: No more gifts My husband comes from a large family as he s the oldest of 4 and we all have young children Since we ve all began having children we started gift exchanging only for the kids on Christmas Christmas 2023 I only had one child at the time my SIL made a point to say on Christmas eve I have to wrap the gifts still we ll drop them off tomorrow I thought this was great because we left his Santa hat at the house that night too Gifts nor hat to ever be seen I m not one to ask hey where s our gifts but i wish I asked about the Santa hat too late at this point Christmas 2024 I now have two children at this point We created registries for the kids this past year because amongst all of us there s 8 We my husband and two kids spent Christmas Eve with my side of the family this year but we saw my MIL FIL on Christmas Day This is when I gave my gifts for my nieces and nephews to my in laws to bring to the rest of the family as they were getting together that night We didn t go because traditionally we do not travel on Christmas Day That evening I was expecting a message at least to say hey thanks for the gifts from any of our in laws not that it was much but at least for acknowledgement but we didn t hear from any of them Now like I mentioned earlier we created registries this past year I can tell who bought what My SIL never gave my children their Christmas gifts yet I can tell exactly what she purchased This SIL is not immediate family It s my husbands brother s wife This same SIL never gave my oldest son a 1st birthday gift For additional unrelated context my husband and I were in the bridal party for this couples wedding A week prior to the wedding we my husband and I had a heated argument with my FIL MIL Without notice this SIL seated us at an entirely different table than the bridal party family We looked like total outcasts Despite the argument which had nothing to do with this couple we would ve been behaved cordial civil at the wedding as ADULTS should be Instead we had guests asking what we did wrong to be seated on the opposite side of the venue Yes that was her decision although it was very upsetting to me when I realized where we were seated vs everyone else Additional unrelated context This SIL is the godmother to my other SIL s children and is constantly giving lavish and expensive gifts to my other nieces nephews I am not jealous I want to make that VERY clear However I do feel like my children will eventually notice when they re old enough that they re not being treated the same or that they didn t even get a gift at all I don t feel confrontation is necessary as I feel it ll go in one ear and out the other and personally just want to cut them off entirely In the future if they were to give us gifts I d probably reply by saying oh I thought we weren t exchanging anymore I m not even sure why I m posting this other than to get it out off my chest Am I wrong for feeling the way I do Should I say something Or just let it go move on but just stop buying gifts entirely",,,mother

text body: I know my dad had a rough time the last 1 5 years especially with the passing of mom I feel that But the patterns stay What I can expect from him time and time again is like 25 of all conversations a question about something that involves me but not actually me What did the doctor say at your appointment How is that lady doing you were visiting A practical thing he at times can ask about And then it s about him again for 1 hour straight the help he needs from me and how tough everything is Ok it s no walk in the park with now a cathether peeing bag don t know the name But it s always the case I have to force myself into the conversation without him responding to what I actually say My full adventure of being 6 months away from all his negativity because my plate was already wayyy too full he chose to let me summarize it for 3 4 5 minutes not acknowledge anything then go off on a tangent about the manager I spoke about who took my job away even with me calling him a senior because managers were basically a trigger word I took care of him by being the replacement psychologist with him literally saying it didn t make a difference This makes me feel nauseous angry and not taken serious at all I feel so hopelessly incompatible with him He draws conclusions out of thin air without asking me anything agreeing with the mediator I hired It s obvious you haven t processed the passing of mom What the actual fuck She barely knew me at all for only an hour He says he wants to help me financially self inflicted college debt and I believe that even when i m ignoring the point he makes me feel like a dumb kid because he writes out everything like I can t think for myself and in my own advantage That is because I have to tippy toe around his feelings all the time my aunt struggles with that too He doesn t fully own mistakes he made and I hate that",,,child
