author: CrimsonMeliodas
text body: Hi everyone I ve never posted on reddit before and this is an old account so I majorly apologise if this is very lengthy or is hard to follow I m 18F almost 19 and live with my mum 51F my stepdad 31M and my younger sister 9F I m currently a university student finishing up my first year in university and the problems with my mother keep stacking up but have gotten worse throughout my year in university I have chosen to stay living at home because of a few reasons these including I have to pick up my little sister from primary school every other week I have high functioning ADHD and am currently on a 3 year waiting list for medication and don t cope well with other people being within my safe space and have a hard time staying organised so my room is usually quite messy and unorganised I also have a medium distance girlfriend who has autism and doesn t cope well with being around multiple people she is unfamiliar with as it makes her uncomfortable so living at home allows me to see her often while minimising costs and makes it easier for both of us to see each other comfortably I want to also mention that my mum really likes my girlfriend and has no issue with letting her come over every month for a week or two her and my mum get along well and she encourages her to come over often so that isn t causing the issues I have As I mentioned I m a university student and the only income I get is from student finance and that s it I am physically unable to get a job because I have to pick my little sister up from her primary school every other week which means I need to be home to pick her up and babysit her for a bit until my mum comes back from work Furthermore I also need to then babysit my little sister on her school breaks which can last from a week up to 2 weeks and then 6 7 weeks in her summer break which will make me unable to get a job more than I already struggle I also must babysit her throughout the week when my mum and stepdad go shopping or go anywhere because my little sister doesn t like going with them anymore she just likes playing on her tablet all the time This means I always need to babysit her whenever they go anywhere and this happens often throughout the week I also have to skip quite a few of my Uni classes because they override the time slot that I have to pick my sister up meaning that I also miss valuable teaching time within Uni and basically have to skip an entire week of Uni to pick up my sister As I am only on student finance and am physically unable to get a job I only rely on my student finance which is extremely hard to manage due to my ADHD and how I must deal with all my personal costs with no financial help This is a problem because I have to constantly pay for prescriptions my glasses all my travel costs my girlfriends train fare when she sees me and my own when I see her all my clothes new utilities and etc Additionally I also pay 200 rent every month to live at my house This is meant to include all my food water bill and electricity However these are all met apart from the food part My mum usually pays for me to eat throughout the week by making meals at dinner time for me when it is group food otherwise I make food myself On weekends my mum doesn t cook because she says she can t be bothered because of work so she orders take out I have to pay for my own share within this take out Every time she orders it she pays for her my sister and my stepdad but she always asks me if I want to put in for a takeaway meaning I have to pay for my own food when she orders this This bothers me because I pay rent which is meant to include ALL my food her words but I have to put in for take out on a weekend because my mum doesn t prepare dinner If I say no then I get no food and she only orders it for them 3 and I m left with no food from the takeout These take outs aren t fancy either they re just your average take out that you d get from around the corner or something like that If I say no I then have to either order my own take out later on at night or I have to prepare my own food This bothers me more than it normally would because I do not possess very good cooking skills My mum has taught me no life skills even though I ve asked plenty of times when I was a teenager for her to teach me how to cook use the washer etc She refused She never helped me nor taught me She said she would and then never did Now that I m 18 she expects me to magically know how to do everything and know how to cook I can only make simple meals that you use an air fryer for or simple dishes like pasta or breakfast foods because I ve not been taught how to cook otherwise When I don t know how to perform these skills I am belittled for not knowing how even though she hasn t taught me when I ve asked For example when I didn t know how to turn our oven on she came in and sighed then said for fuck sake op how do you not know how to turn an oven on You re 18 now you should know how to do these things it s not hard I replied back saying I haven t been taught how to do it and I have asked before if you could teach me but you never did These comments from her are quite common too She says comments like that whenever I can t do basic skills because I haven t been taught how to do them Therefore I have to either spend a lot of money a month on take out food or I won t get fed or I have to deal with belittling while I make simple food which I personally don t find really fair I also have a challenging time saving due to my ADHD and find myself splurging on things that are to do with my fixations as I am a collector This never overrides my rent or anything like that I always have money saved in my savings for rent but paying for everything including leisure is a lot of costs and I spend a lot of money on replacing stuff that I need and paying for all the costs that come with being an adult I m not expecting her to help or give me any money to help me out as I m 18 it s my responsibility to manage my costs But as I pay rent I think it s only fair that if they are ordering food I should also automatically get my food too instead of paying my own share even though I also pay to live there Now feel free to criticise me on this opinion I m here to get advice after all I just personally think it s not fair I have also spoken to my girlfriend and she shares the same opinion as me and thinks it s not fair the way she treats me but I also want opinions from an outside perspective because my girlfriend might be a little biased as she doesn t really like my mum all that much because of how she behaves lol which I m not faulting her for at all Adding onto the leisure spending my mum also complains about how I spend my money and always asks me how much of my student finance I have left in a snarky tone if you can see what I mean haha This is usually when I buy something a little more expensive like a new figure for my collection or new clothes or something like that She usually asks that whenever I buy something expensive and makes snarky comments about what I buy and spend my money on If I go out with my girlfriend a lot she will make a snarky comment about my spending habits and belittle me for spending a lot although she has done research into neurodiversity and how it affects things like that due to my sister having autism I was only diagnosed recently with ADHD last August when my mum kept insisting it was autism for over a year when I told her years prior that I think it was ADHD She didn t offer to get me tested or anything like that when she believed I have autism she just kept correcting me when I said I think I have ADHD and told me I was getting obsessed with thinking I have it Her only reasons for believing I had autism was because I ve had a fixation on a video game ever since I was around 5 and because I m a picky eater Furthermore with the money complaining she complains when I try making plans with my friends or have any plans with my stepdad because she is going stuck with my sister so she essentially complains when she has to babysit my sister on her own meaning I have to spend less time with my stepdad because she complains about having to take care of my sister or she can t stand him being away from her for too long However when she has plans I am automatically expected to be free to babysit my sister I m expected to cancel my plans and make myself free to babysit my sister so she can have her plans This happens very often She cancels my plans because she doesn t have anyone else to babysit my sister and automatically expects me to be available for it meaning I have to babysit my sister for a whole day and usually for the entire night if the plans are staying at a hotel or being away with my other siblings This further solidifies why I can t have a job because I would physically have no time for the job due to how much I take care of my sister Adding onto the financial struggles I have gotten my last student finance payment which was paid at the end of April and I have had to spend 600 of that on a new PC My old gaming PC was very outdated as my brother gave it to me for free when he built his new one That PC is very outdated as he used it for gaming back when he was around 14 15 and he is now 22 The PC lagged on any game and made it EXCEEDINGLY difficult to play games such as Fortnite as I d lag just running around The storage was also getting full as I used that for all my Uni work and it only had around 400GB of storage I desperately had to get a new PC as my main hobby is gaming and I need one for university I spent 600 on my PC now because of how high end the PC is it has a lot of storage and it ll last me a lot of years My mum hasn t changed her behaviour although she knew I needed to buy a new PC She has just been complaining more about my spending and looming over me saying I need to make my student finance last until September I ve been offered no help with the cost of this PC which I didn t expect as it is a lot of money but I am still being asked to put in money for a takeaway every week and I have to pay for my own alcohol when I drink with them and get don t get offered any All other leisure s need to come from my own wallet which I understand however my PC has set me back a lot and I can t afford to keep up with all my expenses being 600 down and not being able to get a job whatsoever My sisters summer break is coming up too meaning I have to babysit her for the entire summer all week and I won t be able to get a job to support myself during this time making this a whole lot harder This is quite long now so I ll wrap it up with this last point My mum likes to humiliate me a lot and I m sure she gets a kick out of it I ll explain Since I have high functioning ADHD I find it extremely difficult to organise myself and to help with this I usually keep certain items like my wallet and such in a certain spot so I can always find it otherwise it s as if its disappeared haha I also have the very known floordrobe that most ADHD people have I would prefer not to have the floordrobe but I have no space in my drawers or wardrobe for most of my clothes because the wardrobe is taken up by her excess dresses which take up most of the area in the wardrobe meaning I ve got a huge lack of space in storage of clothing essentially meaning it has to end up on the floor My disorganisation means my room usually ends up very messy and I get executive dysfunction when it gets messy even though I want nothing more than to clean it My lovely girlfriend is such an angel as she helps me with this as she loves tidying up as it helps her de stress and she knows how much I struggle with keeping my space organised and tidy She won t judge and she helps me in anyway she can However my mum is the opposite and she humiliates and belittles me for how disorganised and messy my room can get sometimes She purposefully waits until I am out of the house to go into my room to purposefully get herself angry so she can send me very passive aggressive texts telling me how disgusting I am for my space and how I should be ashamed and humiliating me When I say she does this as soon as I leave the house I mean it An hour after I m out I ll check my phone and there will always be a text about how disgusting I am She purposefully goes in when I m not there just to rial herself up about it and if it s not when I m out of the house she makes snarky comments about my room and tries humiliating me that way It makes it worse that she purposefully tries to humiliate me in front of my girlfriend to belittle me and make me feel humiliated about my own space She will tell my girlfriend about my room and say to me she wouldn t like the state of your room when she sees it My girlfriend has reiterated multiple times to my mum that she doesn t mind whatsoever and likes helping me because she knows I struggle and that her helping me clean also helps her destress My mum replies to this saying I don t know how you can like going in there and dealing with it even though my girlfriend assures her that she struggles herself and likes helping me clean and organise When my brother lived with us he was worse than me He was your average gamer boy who didn t leave their room at all and was what people would call a basement dweller and I m sure you can fill in the blanks for how his room was Even then he was never as humiliated and belittled as much as I am even though I have a reason as to why I m like that and have shown multiple times that I don t want to have my space like that My apologises that this is long there is a lot to get out as it is a long story and there are a lot of details that I have left out of this post for conciseness I just want some advice and opinions on what I could do moving forward to try helping me deal with this as it has been difficult for me as it has just gotten worse as I ve gotten older All advice is appreciated and thank you so much for reading and any advice that is given I ll try answer as many questions as I can TL DR My mum makes it hard for me to manage my own funds within my household although I pay rent to live there as a university student I am unable to get a job to support myself due to taking care of my little sister for most of my time She also belittles me because of lacking basic skills how I spend my money and humiliates me because of my disability Any advice on how to deal with someone like this",18.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: Looking to see if my feelings are valid and for advice for what I can say to my mom Shortened if you can believe it because 37 years of drama is a lot to type out My 33f half brother 37m has failed to launch into adulthood We were raised together by our mom 74f and my dad 81m who raised my brother as his own once they were married when my brother was 3 We were raised with the same opportunities We grew up in an affluent area went to great public schools and our parents had the funds to send us each to college without needing to take on debt He was never interested in school Flunked out his freshman year in high school parents sent him to a boarding school for troubled teens that he flunked out of after a year he went back to our local high school where he was kicked out for flipping a desk at a teacher was then sent to a neighboring high school where he didn t graduate My parents eventually held his hand long enough for him to get his GED when he was 24 or 25 He spent from age 18 to 30 living in my parents basement either living off of them getting social security or working an entry level job and either getting fired or quitting by not showing up At 30 he got his girlfriend who also lived in the basement pregnant The deal with my parents was that they would find a place to live before the baby was born They did not and brought the baby back to the basement to live My mom took the baby away in the first week when she heard my nieces mom screaming at her to shut up when my niece was crying My mom has a rental property about an hour from where they live Eventually they came to the conclusion that my brother and his girlfriend were not going to look for a place to live so my mom evicted her tenants from her rental property they fixed up the house and moved my brother and his family in when my niece was 6mo The deal was that each of them would pay my mom 500 per month in rent totaling about half of market rent for the area His girlfriend did not last long in the home before she left with the baby and started a custody battle My parents paid for my brother s lawyer and he ended up with full custody and his ex bounced out of his daughter s life and has never returned I believe he receives less than 100 per month in child support My niece is now 6 My brother is no longer working or receiving any income other than child support He spends his days sleeping and his nights gaming He said he cannot drive for Uber any more because his car is making a noise He has stopped paying his 500 per month in rent My mom has made several upgrades to his home to make it more comfortable for the two of them My mom pays his bills she does his yard work takes care of his mail and pays for my nieces babysitter She picks my niece up every Friday and takes her for the weekend and all holidays and drops her off at school on Monday She goes over every Wednesday to do homework with her she does her laundry buys all of her clothes and school uniforms pays for her health insurance and manages her doctors appointments she bathes her and does her hair on the weekends She spends every summer with my parents where my mom pays for her camp she spends winter breaks with my parents and goes camping with them on spring and fall breaks Santa knows to visit my parents house because that s where he can find my niece and my mom takes care of her birthdays My brother does not bathe her regularly make sure she changes her clothes or underwear does not make sure she brushes her teeth or hair or make sure she goes to bed on time He doesn t sit down to do homework with her or keep snacks in the house for her He recently said he thinks she can just come home on her own if she has her own house key and take care of herself while he s not home and she doesn t need supervision I have received alI of the information about my brother from my mom since around 2016 I RARELY speak to him I went NC LC after graduating from college Not because of his failure to launch but because he was emotionally and verbally abusive to all of us when I was growing up and did not stop when I moved back home after college so I left and went NC LC I speak to him when I see him rarely at my parent s house He was invited and attended my wedding and he is invited to my home every Christmas Eve He has been blocked on my phone and all forms of social media for years but I maintain a great relationship with my niece and talk to her multiple times a week when she s with my mom I also see her frequently when I go to my parents house I was talking to my mom yesterday and she said that she told him she would not be able to support two households for much longer She said she has no time for her own life or responsibilities She has said she would cut him off SEVERAL times in the past so I do not believe this time will be any different He knows how to get what he wants from her He knows she will never let him or his daughter be homeless and he is taking full advantage My husband and I are expecting our first baby in October and after our combined parental leave is finished my mom has agreed to watch our baby three days a week at my parents home My mom has a history of spending the majority of her time and energy focused on my brother and niece My brother and I each live an hour away from our parents in opposite directions She travels to my brother s house multiple times a week and has said I live too far away to visit She only comes over for Christmas Eve or Thanksgiving and cannot find my home on her own without getting lost We have lived in the same home for 7 years When I was getting married she did not want to help with anything other the finances they agreed to pay for my dress and the caterer In the past few years I have struggled with cancer and infertility and she never wanted to visit me in the hospital or help me through recovery She only offered to help financially which was very kind and we are thankful for they paid for our IVF medication after insurance Her justification for helping with our IVF meds was because she helped my brother buy a new truck that has poor gas mileage so he cannot use it for Uber When I asked if she could visit me in the hospital to meet our baby when he arrives she grimaced at the idea and said it depends on where I give birth When she found I would be giving birth less than 10 minutes from her home she said oh okay I think so I have a suspicion she will back out of helping us with childcare due to her being too busy managing my brother s life and raising my niece I grew up being extremely close to my maternal grandma and want the same experience for my kids I feel like they will never be a priority compared to my brother and my niece I also feel like I am responsible for my own relationship with my parents They do not reach out to me unless they need either my help or my husbands and they do not visit They come to me for all computer or phone help and ask my husband for any heavy lifting help they need They do not ask my brother for any help because he is so unreliable and annoying I do not want to be entirely responsible for my children s relationship with my parents if that makes sense I want them to want to be involved in my kids lives Am I right to feel like my parents mainly my mom s lives revolve around my brother and that he s taking advantage of them It feels like my parents have bounced me out of their lives because I have successfully launched into adulthood and they don t need want to worry about me I don t know how to verbalize my thoughts about their priorities and concerns about their relationships with my future kids not being important to them TLDR Brother has failed to launch and had a child Parents enable

text body: I 30m got married this past weekend and it was the best day of my life Everything could not have gone better However my eldest Brother did not come to my wedding and that really sucked because all my siblings were somewhat close growing up I live in Arizona and got married here and he lives in Michigan I understand out of state travels are tough but how do you miss your own brothers wedding He told me it was for his son s hockey tournament To add on top of this I was told by my sister that he was golfing during the ceremony I know that the people that matter are those that came but it just bothers me If someone told me they were missing their brothers wedding that they were asked to take part in that they were missing it for a hockey tournament and golf I would think that person needs to sort out their priorities Maybe I am over reacting Is this something I should just try to let go of and never bring up to him",30.0,male,brother,30-39

text body: Using a throwaway account because I don t want this linked to my main I am 22f from India I live with my brother 27M mother 49F and father 54M My family has always had a lot of issues It s always felt like everything s held together by a thread that could snap at any moment Last month when my Grandpa died mom s dad my parents had a huge fight mostly dad screwed up and then I shifted to Grandma s place to keep her company for a bit so she doesn t spiral out by herself I stayed at her place for almost 2 months before she left to stay with my uncle s family for a bit While at her place I had a lot of peace and quiet and no family drama or tension or tip toeing around everyone s feelings I didn t have to worry that one wrong word would make my dad or my brother blow up I didn t have to keep checking whether whoever I was talking to was actually listening to what I said I didn t have to sit and listen to a constant barrage of useless unsolicited advice when I just want to vent I shifted back home after Grandma left They ve always fought and stuff but I now wake up every morning to raised voices and yelling in the kitchen between my dad my mom and my brother I have to deal with my parents constantly cribbing to me about what the other did or said or didn t do or didn t say I have to worry that one word will lead to my dad or my brother blowing up I ve lost my peace I had peace for the first time and then I lost it I tried talking to my brother about it but he tries to play it down saying it s not as bad as I think it is I ve tried telling my parents that I m not their therapist or their marriage counselor and to stop treating me as such But they don t seem to get it They keep venting and cribbing and expect me to pick sides To them this is all a normal part of being a family They don t seem to understand that they are one team not two and that they certainly shouldn t be taking jabs at each other and trying to score one over the other All of them love me and treat me like the baby of the family but honestly it feels suffocating to keep living with them I want to leave and move out or something but circumstances make it so that I can t leave for a while atleast I also considered therapy but we don t have the money for it and they wouldn t go for it nor would they let me go for therapy because they don t believe in stuff like that They think therapy is for weaklings I want to be able to protect my peace until I reach a point where I can shift out but I don t know how I would appreciate any advice insights anyone has to offer",22.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: Hey so I m a 17 year old girl and I m having trouble getting along with my sister in law As the title would suggest She got married to my brother last December but my family and I have known her for 4 years now My parents had met her parents in college smallworld But that s a different story So here is a bit about me I m pretty much an extrovert so I have no problem getting along with anybody And I m often mistaken as a 24 year old people say I don t act my age We both have very religious family s and both of our fathers are pastors This info will come in handy later So my sister in law who I ll be calling Abigail for this story is 20 and she just graduated from college She is from Wisconsin while we are from Illinois we live in the Chicago area So we all have different tastes in food people and humor My family is really sarcastic and male centered I m the only girl out of 5 brothers and two other guys we kinda adopted while she has a very Female centered family she is the second of 4 sisters and 2 boys So that s a really big difference between us both I have tried to be more like her by instead of wearing big and baggy clothes to wearing cute dresses and more of an feminine look cause that s how she dresses And I try to be nice to her every time I see her And I understand that it s all new for her with just graduating and being married but it s like every time I m by her she always looks at me a certain way its like she is looking at a misbehaving little kid and it just makes everything awkward As well as she talks to me like I m a troubled child I have been diagnosed with some mental illness nothing insane but it is frowned upon in my religion to not be perfect especially because I m a pastors kid Also I have a very low immune system because of auto immune diseases and I get sick really often and she often comments on the fact that I ve not been at church in a while because of the fact that I m sick She has in a joking manner said that it would be crazy if your just faking right Which I have had people think that and say that I m just a faker so it doesn t really bother me that much But on Mother s Day she decided to go up to her families house to surprise her mom she lives in Wisconsin so it was about a 6hr drive up there so she decided just to stay the night So while she was gone I asked my brother that she married if there was a problem between me and her He told me that she feels I am in mature and overly cliquish with the girls at my church there s only two and their sisters plus I ve known them since I was 10 she also feels that I am racist The two girls in my church are Spanish and since we live in the Chicago area there are lots of different kinds of people but I don t think I ve ever been racist towards them I do acknowledge that we are different in culture and how we were raised so I don t know if that s racist but yeah He also said that she thinks I am too Boy crazy while being too guyish he said that she also feels that I am very young for my age which I don t understand at all so I asked my mom for her opinion on this and she basically just said that my sister in law is going through a big change in her life Which I totally get it but this change has been for like 5 6 months now and my mom said that I should try to be more excepting of her but I thought I was being pretty excepting of her Also she thinks very differently than I do which is probably affecting our relationship as well She says I just have to be the bigger person and that my sister in law still young But we ve been like a pastors kid you always have to be the bigger person because you re always doing extra stuff that nobody else does And my sister in law doesn t get that she doesn t think we do anything extra Also probably should have said this at the beginning but she is my youth pastors wife Which also makes it awkward Honestly I don t know what to do Also if this doesn t make sense sorry this is my first post",17.0,female,sister-in-law,10-19

text body: I 17F have a younger brother 14M who I was very close to Our family and siblings i have two older siblings are actually quite close My two older sisters were especially really close when they were younger as well Me and my brother did EVERYTHING together from painting going on walks having sleepovers in each other s rooms watching movies playing outside everything We obviously used to fight but that s normal Now he turns 12 13 and he starts ya know becoming awkward wearing headphones a lot being obsessed with a girl group not as talkative and it was really hard for me to deal with that because he slowly stopped doing things with me I am a very caring sister and can tend to be a little clingy or too caring sometimes so I used be sad when he officially stopped doing anything with me I used to be concerned for him you know watching something he s not supposed to getting too addicted to his phone or attached to online stuff just bc that s not really how the culture of our house is either so if he ever was doing anything he wasn t supposed to I used tell my parents Now it got to a point where my brother said he needed his boundaries and I had to give up on trying to do things with him so I listened and i backed off bc my parents said to just leave him be I know it may sound like I was controlling or not giving him space but if u look at it from my perspective I just wanted to do some sort of activity with him even if it was something I didn t like bc all I wanted to do was spend some time with my brother And in our home its not very common for siblings to be so distant like that my two older siblings are in uni and busy Anyways I back off and for the last year or so I never ask him to do anything with me bc he gets outbursts I respect his space his privacy and don t tattletale on him anymore i was 14 15 at the time when i did tattletale lol He gets mad and irritated really easily and its only always at me The problem is is that he doesn t behave this way to any of his older siblings just to me Example from recent times I into his room to say goodnight or to tell him something he gets irritated but when my older sister goes in his room 8 times within an hour he doesn t have any problem bc they have similar interests in that girl group and music ig I always talk and treat him with respect and am always so nice to him bc he s my younger brother But when it comes to how he talks to me he calls me a baby a brat someone who leeches off of their parents money for the rest of my life bc he buys albums ig and its with his own money but we both buy clothes and everything with our parents money Is that something appropriate to say to an older sister even when i didn t even say anything to initiate this comment to be said I got into a university close to home and another one 4 hours away He always tells me why dont I move out and go somewhere far away bc he doesn t want me living in the house with him for the next 4 years But I want to go to the close university so i can take care of my parents and reduce expenses on them they also prefer i stay home But he talks as if he s my parent trying to tell me right or wrong and what decision I should be making for myself He tries to prove how mature he is at 14 years old compared to me by making hurtful comments Yesterday we had a huge fight over a table basically my dad had wanted me to sell a table on facebook marketplace so i could make some money and kept it in the backyard for me and my brother came out and started throwing it out without any of our parents direction to do so I m telling him repeatedly that I am gonna be selling it and my dad was there as well but didnt say anything and he pushed me multiple times and wasn t listening Then based on what my parents have told me i went to my mum and told her that he isn t listening and what should i do and i went back out and told him mum said that we are selling it leave it and he said why dont we sell all of your stuff Why don t we get rid of you Why can t leave so i dont have to see you ever again you re such an obstacle in my life And he said all this hurtful stuff over something so trivial and that he wasn t even supposed to do And this is with me saying absolutely nothing except arguing that we are keeping the table Yesterday my parents had a talk with him that that s not how you are supposed to behave and that he should apologize and he said he meant every word and its true That im a baby and im sheltered and that my parents SHOULD be sending me away and this isnt the first time he s said such hurtful things sometimes he says them randomly and uncalled for when i do absolutely nothing I usually just ignore them but it s like he bullies me everyday by saying something hurtful I dont bother him i dont force him even sometimes we ll be friends and he ll talk to me about school but then the next moment or the next time he sees me he ll start talking rudely again now to wrap up my parents had a talk with me and said I APPAPRENTLY ME have to never go in his room anymore and dont talk to him My brother s reasoning for this behavior is that its been building up bc i left a paper on the ground when he was cleaning and I played with his blinds he fell asleep on the ground at 1am and his light and blinds were open so i was abt to close them for him and he screamed at me and that me saying goodnight to him in his room is an intrusion of space but when my older sister does it its totally okay TLDR What am i doing wrong My dad says that I don t need to talk to him he ll do activities with me but my

text body: Hi everyone I 20M am the younger brother of my older sister 31F yes I know too much of a generation gap I wanted some advice on the issue that might be leading onto a divorce My sister was married more than an year ago and after around 4 months of marriage my brother in law and she were starting to have issues as she was more of an extrovert and manmani self important person as she always wanted herself to be right now one else get to be right that s how it was when would visit our home before marriage and my father and mother would leave her as it is and won t confront her or force her she was always at her own will So after marriage this thing affected her too much as my brother in law was an entirely different and new person to her due to an arranged marriage via shaadi or some other site idk it was though online matching and she though that she would get away with everyone like she used to so in the early days of the marriage she would live with him in banglore and would do nothing but sleep and game in her pc and would not do any chores and my brother in law would go to the office and also do the chores for her please don t take this in the bad way I m just explaining the situation But he was okay with it and she also living with him changed but the first problem came when his friends started visiting their flat as being all male freinds they would talk about anything and mind u not they once said to her that she was fat and my brother in law did not even tell them to stop instead laughed with them I don t know the full context but something like this happened so as a result of this she was so angry that she walked out of the flat and and my brother in law held her by her hand and demanded that she remains in the flat to this she became angrier and shrieked and went inside a room in front of his friends this happened and that when she called home to tell that she is not going to be with him My mother and father tried to console her after endless conversations ith finally ended but with mixed feelings she cut the call saying she ll look into it This was first incident I got to know and the second incident happened during Diwali night was also when some of his friends were taking and one thing or the other she was offended by his friends and again she was going to leave the flat and go out but this time he held her by her neck and said you are not going to go out but this time she held firm and went out crying and said to my mother on the phone that she wants a divorce without any thought it was one of the worst diwali i experienced in my life the darkest my mother and father both talked to her for endless hours trying to console her but this time she was not ready to even go to his house and he also was not ready to talk to her as according to him she was going out in front of my brother in law s sister and her fiancee So after a week by staying in a hostel after the diwali night she came to a conclusion to return to my dad and mom s place and live with them I was busy with my college so I want sure of what convos they had but I knew for sure that this is serious with the tone I heard from the phone So after living with my mom and dad for 2 months my brother in law s ender brother also came to my house for taking to my sister but she says unless my brother in law apologizes she won t talk to him and same case with my brother in law he won t apologise also was not even unhappy of what happened he bought a new bike after my sis left his house and would send messages to my sister that I am doing fine without any problems no need to come back and what not this was told to me by my sis i don t know how much is true but some seems to be So after all this comes to the current day she is currently with him now as she has to attend some kathak completiotion so she is in blr and from her conversation with me it seems she does not even talk to him while in the same house and is yet to give a clear info if she is going forward or not with the marriage Please let me know if I should take any step as my parents have lost all hope of anything and also my brother in law s family have also lost hope of anything whom should I talk to or leave everything as it is as both of them are fighting for very childish reasons according to me I would love to have your opinions",20.0,male,brother,20-29

text body: Let me start by telling you story of my boss who retired at 60 last month Gem of person and no complains whatsoever about him as junior This is about his family life As on the date of retirement his wife is around 55 has son who is in 9th standard age around 15 yrs daughter just finished her graduation age around 25 yrs He told that he married late So after basic back calculation I could conclude that he might have married at aroud 33 One day during discussion he mentioned that he can not afford to mentally retire as he has to do lot of work even now on family front This conservation got me thinking about following 1 His Daughter is yet to be married Lets me realistic as father its major financial committment He doesnt have pension so everything has to be done from his lumpsum corpus he received on retirement 2 Son is yet to finish school Expenses of his college education again have to be drawn from lumpsum corpus 3 His wife is home maker so he has to take care of all these financial obligations 4 His daughter started working and i think she ll be ready to help him out But i know him as person he wont accept it Now i realised why my father wanted me to get married before his retirement This is all the financial aspect of situation Now lets think about emotional aspect of it 1 Kids of almost 95 of his peers are settled in conventional sense like finished education and married at least So there is peer pressure 2 His peers are enjoying quiet peaceful life and he has to still keep up with wordly affairs 3 By the time his son finishes his college he will be 65 So next 5 years are very crutial for him 4 By the time his son marries and he has grand kids if his chooses to he will be 70 So after working for 36 yrs of life earning money for family he has to work 10 more years so that his children no longer need him in conventional sense 5 If they get some health issues his children will have to look after them when they themselves have their young kids to take care 6 I visited their home and his wife is still on her toes to take care of their teenage son She is also 55 so mostly will be facing menopause related health challenges 7 As mother myself i could understand how concern she is for her son Taking care of teenagers is toughest of all when you are dealing with your own health issues too Lets be realistic settling children down is considered fathers responsibility till date and men feel sense of failure if it doesnt happen So whole point of this story is Did my boss understand repurcussions of his decisions to marry and have kids late Most probably NO He had government job which was relatively less stressful and secured compared to jobs these days So he could work till 60 Most of today s jobs are not alike With life catching up i cant see myself working in conventional job till 60 I feel like I am done when I am only 36 I guess many people of my generation will agree with me Other day i wrote post about women s marriage in late 30 s Where i mostly wrote about physical aspect of it For men of course there is issue of deriorating sperm quality But in my opinion for men mental effects outweight physical I read many posts of ppl complaining that their parents are forcing them to get married as they reach 30 They are resorting to emotional blackmail than telling their adult kids about actual practical aspects Its true that its impossible for a 30 yr old man or woman to portrait himself herself as 70 yr old But when we look back time flies and we get old sooner than we realise Financial security is also important when taking decision to marry and have kids But i guess life is all about balance You just cant have it all You will have to take your decisions based on probabilities Purpose of this post is not to tell men or women to marry early Its just to let you all know consequences of decisions made today Your decisions have far fetched effects on mental emotional and financial wellbeing of you and your future kids So plz just be aware Disclaimer I am fee based clarity giver I offer various services like relationship pre marital astro including kundali milan real estate finance etc if you ever need any of these services plz DM on whats app number available on my reddit profile",36.0,female,mother,30-39

text body: Long post sorry I m 30f my mom is 62f We had a TERRIBLE relationship from my teens through early twenties but have worked very hard to repair our relationship the last five years to pretty great success It s relevant to note that recently I had a huge mental health crisis which resulted in me moving back in with her I was jobless at first but got one and I am working hard to not need financial help and contribute how I can until eventually moving out again So far its been 90 great What is baffling me is my mom s semi regular insistence that we have a shallow relationship and that I am the one stopping us from going deeper Examples I have given her to demonstrate this is ridiculously far from the truth I called her sobbing and asking for advice when I was losing my mind earlier this year something I would have never done even a year ago I sought and took her advice re my last break up and kept her updated to an extent I never have before We talk about my career my mental health triggers my insecurities and pet peeves I recently expressed my lack of direction and frustration with my mental health so much so that she connected me with a life coach We argue passionately about politics we recommend and discuss books with each other we even disclosed how much debt we re each in and promised to push each other to save and pay it off And I try very hard to support her equally since we are now both adults She frequently vents about her micro manager boss talks to me about squabbles with friends and her sister She ll occasionally disclose marital concerns she has and listens to my advice We frequently talk about her childhood and past experiences I notice when she s in a weird mood and ask her about it I make very intentional effort to make her feel special and give her well thought out gifts any chance I can But she does this very frustrating thing of approaching me super randomly with really loaded questions What made you cry today Do you feel like you have anything to offer to the world Do you think you are worthless What is disappointing you what do you want to change about yourself Sure these are great questions to ask but not just as I m finishing dinner or telling a lighthearted story about friends or my work day Today I cracked She did it again after I noticed she was frustrated about something She asked me if I have no self confidence and don t value my time and when I got upset that she wasn t taking my word that I DO value myself she came back with the you always shut me out because you don t want a deep relationship with me bit Turns out me coming to her in crisis is not enough She doesn t think the above examples count because I m not coming to her before a crisis happens It s true that in my teens and early twenties I never ever confided in her for anything She will not let it go I seemingly cannot change her mind that I purposefully hide my life from her Despite me now living with her and seeking her out when I m dealing with something In a shameful moment I ended up yelling just fucking listen to me at her Now she won t listen to a thing I say because I need to calm down fair I m ashamed I yelled but I m at my wits end How can I make her see that she IS getting the deep and personal connection she insists she isn t I cannot give her anything more because I already share pretty much everything with her She keeps pointing to our past as if the last several years of growth haven t happened It s so frustrating because every time I think we ve put the subject to rest she pulls the same weirdly loaded questions two weeks later and is upset I may not be in the headspace to dive in or that I do not agree with her assessment that I suffer from low self esteem TL DR I am offering all I can emotionally and with vulnerability to my mom and she is not satisfied and wants MORE connection and refuses to acknowledge how much better we are doing in recent years",30.0,female,daughter,30-39

text body: I am 28F and my sister is 37F Our grandmother passed a couple months ago and my sister was the executor of the will the the house was left to her there are no other assets My sister was given land next to my grandma s house to build her home on which they have been a little over 3 years So now our grandma s house is sitting vacant next to her She is planning to sell it because the house is paid off and is worth a lot like 450k in current market My current situation is that I m in a relationship that has a history of sexual abuse and am trying to figure out a way to leave I had spoken to her maybe a month ago about moving into the house temporarily to give my spouse time to decide if he wanted to keep or sell our home but to give me a way to remove myself She initially said yes on the phone but then when I came to visit her she said they actually decided to sell it and that she could give me a little money once they make the sale They are still in the probate period following my grandma s death so cant sell it currently but that will be up in a couple weeks I just kind of wanted to bring it up more time and discuss me living there and I could pay her rent and work on fixing the things that need repaired And then when I eventually move I would think like 3 5 years to allow me to start over she could sell it but hard to know what the value will be like then Having me in the area would also mean i could help with her kids I dont have any of my own Another issue and part of why I worry she maybe wouldn t want me living there is because I have 3 dogs they are well behaved but its still THREE but they are non negotiable I guess I feel guilty asking her to not act on an opportunity to make a lot of money that she plans to invest in her children s futures But I dont have a lot of options and dont want to regret not trying I dont want to sound greedy or pushy I m just trying to figure out how to help myself when my finances are tight TDLR sister has the opportunity to sell a home no one is living in for a large sum of money but I would like to ask about living in it to get myself out of a bad situation",28.0,female,sister,20-29

text body: Hi all I m F 29 and my Big sis F 31 and brother M 27 I would like to apologize my English is not well versed so please bare with me Thank you We just recently lost our mother age 65 from cancer She was diagnosed last year stage 4 It was all sudden At first we were in denial because no family history in her side died or diagnosed of cancer All died from old age So it s been hard for us For context here is my family story history My Mother was a great housewife She s very hands on us growing up From cleaning washing and cooking oh how I missed her cook foods She s strict but it made us who we are today She s very religious too every night she will prayed with the rosary and her usual prayer for us her children be successful in life Also she prayed for the companies will be working to be not toxic and have good working environment and good officers and bosses I have high respect and very much love her till this day However my father I don t have much any ounce of respect and love for him His previous job is a seafarer According to mom his a great provider when we where young But suddenly he became irresponsible husband Here is the list that he done to us Just to summarize Manhandle my mom especially when he is losing the argument Please take note that mom is 4 10 4 11ft and Father 5 10ft Not going home for 5 years On and off contact Going home from his older sister house his cousin house or in his hometown But not his home with us Multiple mistresses he kept All his older sibling known the mistresses Possible some illegitimate children We don t know Borrowing money to his older sister for us but he lied Which we just known recently during the funeral when one of our cousin tell us this All of us are mad because during that time we have no food I think I was that aged of 13 The money she send to my father was spend in his smoking and drinking M0lesting his two daughters Yes I was a victim at a very young age It happened twice My mother known this and they argued and humiliate my father But we still stayed for the reason of he is the sole provider And I understand why mother stayed We still studying in a private school she doesn t want us to stop studying in a good school for our future Because both of them didn t go to college And education is a must to us Typical Asian Mom but she doesn t care about the grades we have as long as it s passing and we still graduate all good to her Always accusing my mother having a relationship to a family man Which is false Because like I said my mom is very hands on to us she always delivered our lunch in school She always tells us she will go to church and if we want to come with her and we always do If I came home from school I always see her doing laundry cleaning the house cooking for dinner and sometimes asleep We saw everything and our neighbors will tell that my mom doesn t have any relationship with other man only my father Especially last year after mom surgery in myoma and colostomy bag He accused her again having afair Like my ghad my mom is a very introverted person She always stays in the house due to her condition and have time to have an affair My brother stays withe her 24 7 to take care of her He stop working just to take care our mom Always telling my mom and my other cousins have a p0rn video Still false Still grossed and no proof has been made Committed suicide last year because we didn t take care of him Same year as my mom hospitalized and gone to surgery Me and my older sis are paying the rent grocery and all bills And his mad or depressed because we didn t take care of him No when he inflicted stab in his chest he was crying for help and my mother was one who saw what he have done My mom was in distressed me and my brother is the one staying at the hospital just to take care of him When he was discharged he was like proud to tell our neighbors what he have done and tell them that his children is fighting with him No we just ignore him due to lack respect to us and especially my mother Always demanding to give him money for his smoking and drinking This time he is retired from being a seafarer which has no savings and no property to own Me and my older sis income is bare minimum with the bills and groceries are high it s just exact to us and my brother that time is still studying If we didn t give him the money he will act out of control which cause my mom distressed and pleaded us to give him money Currently his working as a daytime security guard in a warehouse He didn t help in our expenses in the house especially the hospital bills But sometimes he always ask us if we have some money It so tiring to understand his situation My mom stayed in her relationship because she still hoping that my father will change till the end She also wants to stop the cycle of broken family from her and my father side She forgave him but didn t forget So in the start of Feb this year my father didn t see her or talk to her Even though we stayed in one small house We always tell him that mom is sleeping And we didn t let him visit her in the hospital as per her request and might cause her more unnecessary stress She was cremated in mother s day which is so hard to us siblings Now me and my siblings are planning to move out from our house My mom is no longer with us and the house is no longer a home without her also we feel we are not safe anymore especially me and my older sister if we stayed But due to expenses and loans we accumulated we might delay the move out Even though we want to move out urgently So reddit is it wrong for us to left our father Also how do you cope up after losing your mother",29.0,female,daughter,20-29

author: aninterestingcomment
text body: Small context I ve F 28 moved recently to the US in late November 2023 to be with my husband M 33 I lived in Malaysia by myself before this I haven t stayed with family since I graduated high school they were pretty toxic and abusive so I keep a distance which also means I might not be used to a different kind of family dynamic My husband has lived in the US all his life At 23 he started paying mortgage on a house This is the house we re me husband brother in law currently living in His other family members would live here on and off brothers in laws and mother but it s still my husband s house despite sometimes it feels like our house is open to them 24 7 another story for another day We re living with my husband s older brother 43 and he should be moving out by the end of the month However he has some habits that make me uncomfortable and I m no longer sure what the right course of action is anymore He walks around in his underwear doesn t clean up after himself nor does his chores He used to sleep on the couch despite having agreed to only sleep in his room once I moved in He s stopped now but we still catch it sometimes and my husband will tell him to go sleep upstairs I m the one who cleans after him most of the time My husband helps out but it s still 80 cleaned by me Honestly I ve been crashing in and out about this mentally being a newly legal immigrant in 2025 in a red state all this at home previous trauma but I m holding onto the hope that he s moving out by the start of next month I can t legally find a job nor can I drive so I m stuck at home 24 7 with my cats and while a part of me wants to show him his actions has consequences I need to make sure the floor is clean and like in case the cats are out and about they won t accidentally eat something or topple anything We ve asked him to help out with chores I asked him to please put on some clothes when I m around I was raised Muslim in Malaysia men who aren t family don t walk around topless in front of a woman and to also ensure his stuff for his aquarium isn t accessible to the cats but he just DOESN T CARE The smallest thing of please making sure his bedroom door and the toilet door upstairs is closed we don t use our upstairs rooms for anything but cats will be cats yknow and he still can t do it He told us he forgets sometimes so I started placing post it notes on his door but he still somehow forgot 3 times in the span of 10 days My cats like playing fetch and they ve been fetching his algae and some other things for his aquarium and despite telling him to put it somewhere else he doesn t so my husband and I clean his mess He has also once flooded our closet and kitchen floor after falling asleep filling up his water tank for his aquarium and we had to clean up most of the mess He half assed it and didn t even say sorry He used to pay rent stopped for almost a year until I told my husband that isn t fair and he should be paying for something Now he pays rent at a discount and my husband was kind enough imo a bit too kind to absolve some of his loans too My husband and him BIL had a sit down talk where he was told to help with the chores and that he needs to start paying rent In that conversation BIL agreed to pay for rent stop sleeping in the living room and move out eventually He did say that since I m unemployed I should be cleaning the house and that he sees my husband cleaning up and cooking When my husband cleans and cooks 90 it s just helping me out Especially cooking cause he thinks only a wife should cook apparently Like my husband and I s cooking process goes I sous chef he cooks it sometimes I still cook for my husband and my husband helps out cleaning the dishes or with prep We both have zero complains about our mechanic Before I came my husband already said he doesn t want me to think I have to cook and clean for him he just wants me to feel safe and relaxed while going through immigrating and making a new life in the US I do all this because I love my husband and like it feels kinda nice to RP as a housewife for now but like I m doing it for my husband and not for his family He then continued to say that my husband spoils me too much and my husband said that she spoils me so I give back so that was that Now however I think he s taking a piss at me tbh His habits hasn t changed he still walks around in his undies I still clean his mess up and we still need to remind him constantly to do chores Is this normal in other Asian households or is this some bullshit How do we fix this Cause I m ngl I m very angry at this situation and I don t want to erupt but my patience is running thin We ve tried talking to him multiple times we tried cleaning up and being patient and we ve tried post it notes I feel like it s inappropriate for me to call him out cause I m his brother s wife and my husband has tried to put his foot down by telling him to move out but it s still a little intimidating for him cause he s his older brother and in Asian families it s out of the norm to talk back to your elders I would love advice I am also okay with talking to him and confronting him instead of my husband cause at this point I hate him He is really taking advantage of my husband s kindness and I hate feeling like a maid in my own house and not feeling comfortable because there is a man in his underwear outside my door that I ve only known for 6 months EDIT TLDR Husband s 33M older brother 43 who lives with us won t do chores or anything much to help out with the house but still makes a mess Tried talking to him and putting post it notes to remind him but nothing works He s moving out within a month but would like to see if there s any way to make his transition smoother aka not me being his

text body: I m a 20 years old guy Currently living with my parents and one brother but being honest I don t know how longer I can take this situation My relationship with them was always complicated My dad s a good person but he was an alcoholic for a long time stopped drinking 5 or 6 years ago after almost dying from an accident cause by himself while drunk and he s the kind of person who just treats you very well if you re the exact way he wants so if you do anything different from what he think is good you re a bad person a bad son and you should reflect about your actions I moved with them to do college the graduation I wanted was during daytime so he started pressing me to do it in the night time because I NEEDED to get a job no matter what he said that he would not die working just to pay the bills alone basically good to clarify that I don t have a job but I work informally sometimes and always help them with the little money I receive So I ended up doing it some weeks after that he started trying to convince me to give up college for now because the place where we live now is dangerous at night I refused because he was the one pressing me for doing it at night and he started saying that I was selfish and never understood them There are a lot of different problems in our relationship but this post will be too long so I m not going to dive that deep My mom Well she s unstable The kind that loves you unconditionally and could die for you but also the kind of person that almost killed me in a rage burst she had she literally strangled me more times than I can remember she also did this to my brothers in other situations She pointed knives at me when I was a kid for very dumb things I did and there s a lot of other dysfunctional behaviors she had through time Like she s used to act like crazy for nothing and after starts crying as she just realizes what she did after it happened it s really crazy to watch this kind of thing And since she started to suspect I m gay I m bissexual but never came out for them for obvious reasons she started to treat me in a bad way Everytime I hang out with some friends when I came home she was always complaining and acting as I was doing something bad she even said that I was a shame once because she thought that I was dating a friend of mine by this time She told me I looked like a beggar once I have afro hair and wanted to use it without styling sometimes and there s a lot of other things here too but for the same reason as the last paragraph I m not going to extend this So I think you guys can bet my childhood and life in general was never very chill inside home My parents did what they could to raise 3 kids while being poor as fuck and I know they re not bad people because they always tried to give us the best But it was always a rollercoaster Everyday thinking if my mom was going to go crazy by something that I did or if my dad was going to come home drunk again and they would fight screaming like crazy It s stressful as a kid not to know if you re safe in your own home As I grew old I realized how dysfunctional this was and that it caused me a lot of problems besides worsening the problems I already had It leads to the situation that made me write this Some days ago I was arguing with my dad I can t remember the subject but we were both very stressed out My mom was not part of that talk but she was looking at me with an ugly face the whole time Then suddenly she gets up the couch and attacked me She grabbed me by my hair and threw me in the ground and then started to beat me The house was a mix of screams and cursing words She yelled I was a disrespectful son of a bitch and other things One day after that I decided to go to my sister s house she lives in another state because I was tired of that situation The days were chill I have a good relationship with her even when we have a problem we always try to solve it talking and usually it works well I came back to start college going to start it tomorrow by the way but I haven t spoke to my mom since I got here again I don t want to she didn t even apologize to me for what she did actually she never apologize when she goes crazy like that but my dad come to me and said I shouldn t act like she s my enemy and he doesn t want anyone in his house acting like this because I don t live here alone so I can t ignore them The thing is it came to the point where I just came back home because of my graduation I don t want to suffer anymore because of how they act they re old now and don t want to change no matter how many times I try to talk about how their behavior isn t healthy At the same I feel guilty because of what my dad said to me I don t want to talk with her but I don t want to be seem as the villain here Am I right if I just continue to live without talking to them Or am I just being childish like he said TLDR I want to stop talking to my parents but I live with them and I don t know

text body: So for some background I graduated last year with a Pharmacy degree Where I am from I have to train for a year then sit an exam in order to be a registered pharmacist I moved back home after living away for university 5 years and started my training year here with my exam being 1 month away The company I work for offer study conferences 4 times a year where they teach us content skills and examine us which has been great so far Since we re at the end of the training our final conference is tomorrow in a city about 1 5 hours away from me and it s 4 days which has been fully expensed by the company and since I m getting paid it is mandatory attendance I hope to work as a relief pharmacist which means going to pharmacies where they need cover which means I will have to drive to places that may be a fair distance away I thought if I drove to this conference it will be great way to build up my motorway confidence as I have only driven on motorways for a short distance My mom randomly mentioned wanting to come with me to get away I said she can come with me but she will have to get the train back as I plan on driving I didn t expect her to stay over as we are not allowed guests and also 4 days away from home when I ll be working full time won t be fun for her She said it s fine she will drive me and stay with me and I honestly lost it I have been extra stressed for my exam and also i do not get along with my mother I can t study at home I am always in the library after work and on weekends this is mainly due to my mother distracting me with her BS when I try and study from home The last thing I would want is to have her stay in my room and disrupt 1 My study plans I was extra excited to have a stress free work space and a room to myself 2 My sleep pattern she sleeps super late and always has her phone on max volume 3 The last time I will spend with my colleagues as I am not staying within my company 4 Building my driving confidence and she wants to drive me 5 Just my peace as I was looking forward to getting away from this toxic bubble and just enjoying my own space 6 I actually took switched my Friday shift for a Saturday as I wanted to spend an extra night away from home She took my reaction as suspicious and is now forcing me to either call in sick or that she will drive me and stay with me and want evidence of my timetable She has the right to be suspicious because I didn t let them know I plan an extra night to myself there but I didn t think it is necessary to mention due to the nature of my parents I just genuinely feel embarrassed and on edge that I m going to be sharing a room with her and also my company might intervene as we are not allowed additional guests I m going insane and i genuinely don t know what to do TL DR my mom is staying with me during a work trip because she doesn t trust me",25.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: This morning on the weekend of my graduation my dad pulled me aside before heading to the airport and hit me with You re going to have another sibling I m 23F I have two brothers 25M and 17M and we re all from the same mom and dad who were married for 19 years and divorced 4 years ago We ve always had a super tight sibling bond and I ve always loved being the only girl middle child in that trio I even remember telling my parents when they divorced Please don t have any more kids Not out of spite just because I really liked our family dynamic the way it was and there s men in my family who have numerous kids from different women and there s big sibling age gaps as well I just didn t want that for me So now my dad s having another kid I knew he could since he s only 48 but I really didn t think it would happen And the worst part is I ve never even met the woman he s having the baby with He s never mentioned her never said he was dating anyone I don t know her name what she looks like nothing And apparently she doesn t even live in the U S So I have no idea how I d even see this child or build any kind of relationship with them I feel shocked honestly And kind of betrayed that he chose this moment my graduation weekend to randomly drop this on me like I d be overjoyed I couldn t even fake excitement I just said Oh really Wow What makes it harder is that I ve always cherished close family bonds And now I m looking at a 20 year sibling age gaps Like what kind of relationship can we even have I want to be close with this sibling that part is really important to me but I m scared we won t be able to form a real bond I don t want to feel like a distant relative or just someone who occasionally checks in I want a genuine sibling connection but I don t know if that s even realistic with how far apart we ll be in age lifestyle and proximity And part of me feels guilty for being so negative about it My dad is clearly happy But I m sitting here just not I feel like everything I liked about my sibling dynamic is being rewritten and I don t really like the feeling is it valid to feel like this Or am I being selfish Edit Just to clarify I m not mad at the baby or upset that a child is being born I know none of this is their fault I m just really struggling with the personal adjustment and what it means for my family dynamic especially when this is something I never thought would actually happen Growing up my dad was always super firm about not wanting more kids The topic came up a bunch of times in our house and he was always like Three is enough So when I said Please don t have any more kids during the divorce it wasn t something they took badly That s why this caught me so off guard I truly didn t think more siblings were ever going to be part of the picture",23.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: This relationship ended nearly 9 years ago but I don t know if I ll ever get over it At 20 years old I had recently ended a four year relationship with my first girlfriend and I think it would be fair to say that it was a relatively clean break up with few hard feelings Some months later I received a happy birthday message from a girl I used to got to school with Let s say her name is Josie After some back and forth we ended up going on a date Now as much as I despise her now I can admit that I was absolutely smitten by her at the time So much so that looking back now I looked passed and ignored so many red flags but hey I was a naive 20 year old who really liked a girl and more importantly I had certain non negotiable principles that ended up being my own undoing Some back story for Josie when I knew her at school at 14 15 years old she was relatively quiet Not one of the popular kids but not exactly bottom of the pile nerds either We never interacted much apart from a few jokes and balls of paper thrown at her in class but no one ever had any issues with her When we first got together she had told me a lot about her ex boyfriends who all ended up being abusive Particularly her last one who had been both physically mentally and emotionally abusive to her As a kid who grew up in foster car and kids homes due to abuse I received as a child I was very sympathetic but it also hilighted to me that I wanted to make her feel safe given our shared experience despite it s differences The first ignored warning It s important to note that this was within the first few weeks My band played an acoustic gig at a city centre night club to support a then big band called The View famous for their hit single Same Jeans right in the middle of the whole British indie phase My band mates invited some of their friends to come and watch and I invited Josie We played our set which went well and enjoyed the rest of the night When we got back to my place she asked why I kept looking at one of my band mates friends whilst I was on stage She said while we was playing she overheard her and her friend talking about me and that she thought I was attractive and that I kept on looking at her while I was playing I explained that I wasn t looking at anything whilst onstage apart from either my guitar or my band mates because when you look out to the audance all you can see is silloettes due to the lights pointing at us Josie turned into a different person altogether she went from arguing to screaming to insulting to breaking the relationship off altogether This is where STUPID young 20 year old me really messed up I really liked this girl so I the chivalrous night fought to calm her down and fight for our new relationship until eventually me and Josie were back on She apologised for how she acted she shed some tears and I comforted her and reassured her Little did I know that this would become a pattern in our relationship About a month in I received a text from Josie saying I don t think we should be together At first she wouldn t tell me why but after about an hour s worth of back and forth and me almost begging her to tell me what s wrong she eventually tells me that she has depression and is bipolar It turns out she s always had depression which was brought on by the abuse she received in previous relationships her Dad abandoning her and the abuse she received from her Mum She told me that her Mum had her sectioned in her teens This resulted in low moods and suicidal tendencies 20 year old me in 2010 hasn t got a clue what any of that means so I head to Google and look up depression Low moods lack of motivation and so on but hey I m a chivalrous night remember so it s my job stand by someone when things get hard when they need love and support and to not judge So I go ahead and tell her that it doesn t matter to me and in my own time proceed to look up how to support or help someone with depression I look back now and I was so nieve so immature but I had an idea of how a man should be and I really wanted to do right by her Little did I know that this would be used in EVERY argument moving forward After some time we decided to move in together We got a flat had it all decorated and furnished and hoped to begin our new life This is where things gradually escalated Josie had a temper over the smallest things There would be a huge fight she would say she warned me or told me what she was like and that we shouldn t be together I would try to calm her down and talk She would cry and apologise blame her depression and I would always tell her tomorrow is a new day These episodes escalated more with more shouting more aggression until eventually one arguement she hit me I will never forget it I was so shocked hurt and confused I didn t really know what to do We lived in a high rise flat next to a dual carriageway way that comes off the motorway leading in and out of the city She was threatening to kill herself by running into traffic so I wouldn t let her out of the flat So he pulled a knife out of the drawer and I had to prize it off of her and hide the knives so she started climbing out of the window so I pulled her down and locked it She hit me again Unfortunately Google did not qualify me to deal with this so I called the police The police came to our flat I told them what happened she told them that I was keeping her prisoner in the flat but I explained that she was threatening to kill herself and showed them the hidden knives that I had taken off her They asked me if I wanted to press charges and I said no I hoped that this would be enough to scare her in to not hitting me again Guess what she warned me and told me we shouldn t be together Why did she act like this It was because of her depression which she warned me about she cried she apologised I told her tomorrow is a new day I understand but you don t need to worry because I won t abandoned you I can t even tell you the amount of times that I had to lock windows pull knives off of her take away bleach take away tablets and pull her out of roads before repeating the the whole explanation and forgiveness to reassurance process again until it just became normal Arguments because more personal using any insecurities to insult me Skinny little rat was a favourite of hers given my insecurity about my weight at the time She would threaten to get her male friends to pick her up Run to her family tell them her side of the story which was mostly lies until her family pretty much hated me even after we made up She carried on hitting me progressed to throwing things at me and began using my own affection towards her against me Before you judge me on the next bit I want you to remember that I was young and I really did love her a lot Her lack of self control due to depression made it so that this wasn t her fault and leaving her didn t even cross my mind because what kind of man abandons some one who is ill We decided to have a baby together During the the pregnancy things got worse She started hitting me more often and now this unborn child became a new and effective weapon against me She would threaten to run away with the baby threaten to make sure I ll never see the baby ect As mentioned before I grew up in care It s a complicated back story but I was beaten and abused as a child went into foster homes was adopted then ended up back in foster homes to ending up in a kids home until ending up in my own flat at 16 where at some point I reconnected with my adopted parents I had experienced a lot of abuse a lack of stability but I knew if and when I ever became a Dad I would do every thing I could to be the best I could be And in 2012 my dream came true and we had a beautiful daughter We moved in to a house and my parents paid for some of Josie s car lessons and tests so we could manage easier Just writing things as I go trying to remember things back in the 2010 s onwards going out clubbing and drinking was a big thing and Josie was out around once a week drinking Short skirts high heels and lots of alcohol I don t drink so didn t go out with her plus she was with her own friends which would have been weird Bit it did get to a point where I felt she was living a single girl life As you can tell we argued a lot and she would go out drinking with her friends and whilst out she would post photos on Facebook of her posing and poutong next to random men After the birth of our daughter this didn t slow down If I m honest when with our daughter this didn t really affect her parenting She was naturally really good with babies having lots of nieces and nephews and I like to think that our baby was oblivious to most things although that probably wasn t the case This changed a year later when we unexpectedly had another daughter As our first grew older she was quite clearly a Daddy s girl This meant that our second daughter was glued to Josie s hip all of the time She didn t like anyone apart from Josie Grandparents friends aunties cousins and sometimes even me And Josie made sure of that This began to change as time went on as whilst I was really poor with babies toddlers and kids I was really good with Josie began to build a resentment towards both of the children but mainly our eldest who was still very clearly a daddies girl She would shout and swear at them during her episodes and threaten to hit them But of course during episodes with me she would threaten to run away with them tell them lies about me The children were an effective tool to control me There were numerous occasions where we were all in the car Josie would speed up dangoursly and threaten to drive us all into a wall or a tree which terrifying My life hadn t quite gone how I expected at this point I had a lack of job stability working in sales where at one point I was working 16 hours a day shifts at a call centre I was struggling financially as Josie would take credit out in my name for catalogues and left lots of bills unpaid in my name to fund her night life clubbing and drinking I was underweight being 5 foot 10 and 60 Kilograms around 130 pounds I was hiding the fact that the woman I loved was hitting me insulting me due to the shame and humiliation I no longer spoke to my friends as if I made plans she would be fine with it then start an argument on that day until I didn t go out and then people stopped inviting me out I hated my self my body and my life but at the time I blamed myself and my ability to provide for the the family so I decided to talk to Josie about doing something that I d always wanted to do to get her thoughts on it After a long conversation I decided to join the British Army at 26 years old Not a desicion to take lightly but I wanted financial stability for Josie and our children and I wanted to do it with her blessing to make sure that we were as team in this desicion After competition all tests and assessments the time came to begin basic training so we got to the train station and Josie and my daughters waved me off crying Let me tell you that basic training was almost hell for me and it had nothing to do with the Army Texts started off as supportive to asking for more money to finding out rent was not being paid to asking for all my wages Then to telling me she wasn t happy and wanting to be single then to loving me then to asking me if I was ok with her doing fetish photoshoots to then bring told I m controlling when I didn t like it to then everything being ok Until I received a text from one of her sisters that Josie was on a date with another man I frantically called Josie repeatedly who did not pick up Her sister told me that they had been dating for a while and he was sleeping at my house which Josie eventually denied until she couldn t When I found this out it felt like somebody had yanked my heart out of my chest I look back and pity me back then but despite everything I had gone through I really did love her and I really tried my best to be the man I wanted to be I may not have got it right all the time but I really wanted to do right by her As usual Josie turned nasty she insulted me threatened that I d never see my daughter s threatened to kill them on multiple occasions and emptied my bank account This was the point where I decided I d had enough I contacted my bank for all the unauthorised uses some of which paid for family days out with Josie my daughter s and this new guy thats right the guy that was sleeping with my fiancé in my bed was taking my family out using my money I called social services as Josie was threatening to kill our daughters And I called the police and reported all of the abuse I had received over the years Josie begged for us to stay together for a long time She would not stop begging and she pulled out every trick imaginable sympathy empty promises victimhood depression suicide you name it Eventually my anger subsided and was replaced with sympathy which lead to me cancelling my fraud claim with the bank and cancelling my report to the police something I regret to this day She began telling me about this guy she was seeing telling me they argued because she found a bag of cocaine in his bag and that he was abusive ect Eventually I finished 3 months of basic training and went on to more training which was 5 months in barracks located near my hometown we were heading towards a somewhat amicable break up until one day Me and a female colleague had finished a training module and the cook house was closed so I drove us to KFC to get tea Josie must have seen us eating in the car and before I knew it my car door had been swung open and Josie who was with her sister was screaming and swearing at me and my colleague She hit me scratched me and took my car keys until I called the police I told them everything that happened but Josie told the police that I hit her Any hope of an amicable break up was lost at that point Josie carried on seeing this new man and he quikly moved in with her and my daughters which I wasnt happy about given they had been together barely two months but there was nothing I could do Until I got a call from the police saying my daughters had been involved in a domestic incident It was reported that the new guy had got into a physical altercation with Josie Infront of the children and they were reopening a case for the children with social services They deemed that the new guy was a danger to the children and that there was not to be anywhere near them A master manipulator after some time social services reported no concerns the police never seemed to take me or my concerns seriously and Josie seemed quite content in lying to authorities and spreading lies about me to friends and family but as far as I was concerned I was done All I cared about was makeing sure I was doing everything I could as a dad for my daughters who were now my one and only priority After some time things calmed down and me and Josie had a long discussion We talked about everything thet had happened in our relationship during the break up and how nasty things has got Baring mind this was 8 years ago but I still remember a lot of this conversation I remember saying I don t get things right all the time but I really do think I m a good man and I only ever meant right by you she just said I know We talked about some of the things she had done like threatening to kill us all Shouting and swearing at the kids introducing them to a new man whilst we re still engaged behind my back she cried saying I m a shit mum and I tried to comfort her We eventually agreed that our daughters might have a better chance with me as the primary carer until she can deal with whatever mental issues We spoke to social sevices and completed some paperwork to get the ball rolling Things were looking like they would start to work themselves out until I received a phone call informing me that the new guy is still in a relationship with Josie and is now spending time with our daughters again This is where I had to make one of the hardest decisions I ve ever had to make If I report it Josie will kick off and stop the whole process of making me our daughters primary carer but at least the authories know and I can guarantee our daughter s safety Or don t report it keep Josie sweet can continue to the process of becoming out daughters primary carer but this means putting our daughters in danger I need them with me I need to make sure that they re being looked after properly but what if I say nothing and something happens to them I only had one choice I couldn t not risk my own daughter s safety so I had no choice but to report it Bit I know what the conciquences would be Sure enough I received a phone call and hour later from Josie Did you fucking report me to social services Don t think you re getting them girls I ll make sure you don t fucking see them Turns out to cover her tracks she introduced the same man to our daughters under another name to trick them into thinking it was someone else to avoid scrutiny from social services Then she blamed me Then she said that it wasn t him that abused her but it was her abusing him Then during the court process CAFCSSS who are scum pulled police records were Josie was reported to be involved in 8 physical domestic desputes not including the reports I made so she was never a victim of her ex like she told me when we first got together but it was the other way round We ended up going to court where we agreed share cared custody So much has been missed out but anyway this brings us to 2020 Things have been shaky but it s the best of a bad situation I m seeing our daughters regularly but not nearly as much as I d like but they are pretty much the only thing that kept me going I m in a relationship with Josie s complete opposite a kind hearted caring and just an amazing woman who my daughters have taken to really well And this is where my once estranged adopted parents come in A bit of back story with them for ease I ll refer to them as mum and dad but they in no way deserve this title During my time with them as a child Dad was what I considered a good example of a family man Worked really hard for the family Didn t have too much to say but when he did you listened could work on and fix anything Mum had a loving side but was constantly nagging shouting and very strict If you were on her bad side She would be really spiteful Dad had two daughters already and remarried to my mum Mum adopted me and my brother and then later on adopted a girl who we considered our sister All in all I had 3 sisters and one brother From what I gather my dad and his ex fought in court until my dad resfused to be emotionally and financially blackmailed and decided to hope that his daughters our step sisters come and find me when they were older so we no longer saw them My adopted sister had enough of mum and dad and decided to go back in to care when she was 14 or 15 My little brother had had enough decided to go back into care when he was 9 or 10 and finally I had had enough and I decided to go back into care when I was 13 Mum was overbaring manipulative and at times plain mean However at around 17 we reconnected talked about the past and moved on Now as much as I hate them now I can t lie whilst I was with Josie They didn t know anything about what was happing to me in terms of the abuse and when things got unmanageable financially they bailed me out Mum would often try to meditate and they were generally much more chilled out and supportive than when I was a kid I made a lot of effort with them and undoubtedly they made alot of effort with me But things changed when I deployed to the Falkland Islands for 6 months I had been in my new relationship for some time now and I could tell my mum wasn t keen but it was manageable but my parents absolutely could not stand Josie We realised however that my mum had to keep up the mediator friend role with Josie so that we could make sure that our daughters where either sort me or my parents rather than Josie so we could take advantage of the fact that Josie would take any opportunity to get rid of the kids That way we knew they were being looked after and brought up properly Before leaving for the Falklands me my girlfriend and my parents agreed that they have them as much as Josie aloud to make sure they re looked after properly Whiled deployed tensions were growing between my girlfriend and mum Mum would message saying my girlfriend made no effort with them I d bring it up and then my girlfriend would send screenshot messages of her inviting my mum to do things and getting ignored This sort of thing started causeing a small rift between us but manageable and easily repaired COVID hit which made everything worse but Josie barely had our daughters throughout most of it so I was content When I came home after 6 months Everything seemed Mum seemed off She was dictating contact with my daughter s between everyone one and I began to get frustrated so I called a family meeting to try and solve it We all addressed our concerns mum admitted that she has become really attatched to the girls and admitted she had stepped over the like and articulated why which was understandable At the time things seemed more or less resolved Some time later I was on a two week deployment and received a phonecall from mum about having the kids at some particular dates However this was during a period I was home for leave so I said no but I m deploying for two weeks here so you can have them then but when I m home I need to spend time with them Mum got very agressive shouted and hung up I called Josie straight after and asked her when it comes to seeing the girls as we are the parents can we organise dates please as my mum is trying to dictate everything you know what she s like Jodie laughed and said ye that s fine I get another call from mum kicking off so I hung up and carried on with work I arrive back from deployment and I m lifting my bags from the back of an SV and my phone vibrates as a message has come through from Josie She says that I m no longer aloud to see the children that I have abused them and that they re not safe around me or my girlfriend My head was spinning with shock confusion and panic I let my mum know straight away who seemed just as shocked so I start making some phone calls to social services turn out Josie called raising concerns after being informed by grandmother my mum of I ll treatment from me to the children So call my parents to my house and confront them They she admits it than starts saying how I treat the children is wrong and that I ve changed since coming back from the Falklands I said this is because of the family meeting you wanting to dictate who does what and nothing to do with how I parent I also onto remind them of thier parenting when we was kids which resulted in all of us choosing to go back into the care system Spitting on us when we were naughty banging our skulls together when arguing or developing a stutter because I was scared of saying three wrong thing The conversation went nowhere and she just said I think it s best we don t see each other again and that was that This time I was preparing I downloaded every text of Josie s abuse sound recordings of her abuse and violence photos of marks she left on me every catalogue bill and debt she hadn t paid that got left to me because I was the only one working pictures of my credit score at 200 points to 750 points in 5 years as she no longer has access to my accounts letters from the girls to me and my now fiance pictures Every accusation had a rebuttal with proof I used the freedom of information act to request all social services records medical records police records and school records These raised 18 occasions where an authority pointed out Josie had been dishonest multiple occasions where she has put our daughters in danger records that shoe Josie had been mentally physically and emotionally abusive to at least 3 men had been violent to her own family members Character witnesses whiteness statements from Josie s own family I wanted the truth finally out there Spent hundreds on stationary and hundreds of hours reading every available document with a fine comb A rather clever move from Josie was tell child maintenance that I hadn t paid anything which put me in a nice chunk of debt Stupid me set up child maintenance to stop Josie from trying to extort more money from me Then all of Josie s debts came through like unpaid rent catalogues and unpaid council tax so we agreed I ll pay the debts and when that s paid I ll carry on paying you All of her debts were paid off told child maintance she hadn t received a penny from me now I get to pay it all over again straight from my wages We had CAFCASS meetings where I presented everything They wouldn t even look at it we had pre hearings where I was questioned like a criminal we spoke to CAFCASS again explained what was in the folder we sent them Proof of everything I ve been saying Not he said she said black and white official documents proving I ve been telling the truth the whole time CAFCASS go on to write a section 7 that I received in the mail which contains their reccomendations to the courts I read it and just burst in to tears I just couldn t understand how or why I sat there thinking of ways to kill myself should I leave a note What would I say I called Samaritans didn t know what to say how to start could barely speak He tried to help Just a volunteer But he was just irritating me of course I looked at this legal thing of course I have evidence USELESS But it wasn t his fault I just hung up I eventually went home from work Christmas was approaching we still need to buy this and that for daughters my fiance s says I don t think they re going to be home for Christmas All this time I tried to put up a facade of resilliance for her we keep fighting trust the system just tell the truth and she ll trip up over her own lies karma all that rubbish but it hit home that they weren t coming back from Christmas I had a pile of presents ready but no one would be here to open them Christmas day arrived and instead of celebrating it with my the people I love the most I m thinking of whether or not to jump 30 meters from a prominent bridge in our city to the water But I ve still got some fight back to Google back to the drawing board I dropped 4000 on a solicitor who gave me poor advice and a form to fill in to send to CAFCASS and their solicitor with requests That s 4000 I ll never get back I request a phycological assessment for the courts and this ends up being exactly what I needed we went there l took my 500 page folder with me she asks me questions I answer then proove with evidence she raises questions about how the case was handled Josie is interviewed where she lies the kids are interviewed which catches out more lose from Josie She s never been diagnosed with a mental health condition she does have a history of violence in relationships she s shown to consistently lie or manipulate facts she reported as manipulating our daughters against me She says she suffered abuse from her mum and abuse from me and even compares me to her mum It even mentions mums part in it I have finally been vindicated I have all this evidence printed I have a phycologist confirming what I m saying This really felt like the break through I needed After this supervised visits begin the lady supervising says from what I ve seen I really don t understand why I m here and after two visits we get unsupervised visits This is where things turn my elders daughter tells me that she s had suicidal thoughts A child Whatever Josie and mum has fed to these kids even if it is all lies it s real to them They re just kids how are they supposed to know I try talking with her And that s the last time a saw both of them CAFCASS carried on with their narrative disregarded everything the the phycologist said disregarded all evidence Josie basically has this pink haired overwait scumbag feminist in her pocket and me I represented everything that woman clearly hated There was no winning this case after everything I had submitted and proven I was no better off than day one And worse still because of the fighting because of the intervention by so many people my children were being affected whereby my eldest was suicidal I submitted a position statement airing my grievance but withdrawing my participation in the farce that is the so called family courts that hide behind the anonymity of children to conduct themselfes in a way that suits them without accountability I haven t seen my two daughters since 2022 and I think about them everyday I try to keep up with their lives where I can such as school reports but I really know very little about them now I know they hate me Josie and my mum did a good job in turning them against me and I m sure they ve told them I gave up on them but I haven t at all I m just waiting for the day they come back to find me I m so bored of social media but I want them to be able to find me easily even though I m sure Josie will have blocked me on their accounts If they Google my name I m always near the top of results but I just don t know what they ve been told about me or if they ll ever look for me I have a four year old daughter with my fiancé For the first year or so I fell into a deep depression where I didn t go out I felt guilty having fun or experiencing happiness without my daughter s Me and my fiancé talk about them all the time and our daughter asks about them We re now experiencing life again letting our daughter experience what they did like adventures learning school and so on but there s such a large hole from the gap that they leave I really wish in anyway that hole is filled up again As for my so called parents mums disabled on plenty of tablets and in constant pain for the rest of her life Dad is a door mat that waits on her hand on foot can t even take a shit in peace They move to new houses after destroying relationships with neighbors once they figure out what they are really like As far as I know they see the girls regularly and tell people that their son presumably me is an alcoholic Mum even tells people she was a barrister Those lies got set straight though as someone always knows some one who knows someone Last time I saw them they were picking Josie up from court with me I had them removed as McKenzie friends but I was nice to see Thier support after telling me they wouldnt get involved in supporting me in court when it all started to happen I genuinely wish them a long life as they ve lost 5 children who never want to speak to them they don t speak to parents or their siblings They have absolutely no one apart from the chronic pain and loneliness for the rest of their lives Almost makes you believe in karma As for Josie I don t know anything about her life and I m not interested I loved her once and don t think she ll ever know the effort I made to try and make her happy After everything she did to me I don t think she has an ounce of guilt She won I lost our daughter s and I m absolutely sure that makes her very happy She took every opportunity to look smug in court I ve seen bits and bobs a long time ago about her promoting people to stand up against domestic violence about suffering with BPD Bipolar and every other mental health disorder that she was never diagnosed with which tells me she can t feel guilty because she genuinely believes her own lies I do wonder if she ever has random thoughts of guilt though Maybe about taking away their daughters Dad or about what she put me through But I doubt it And me I m due to be married to the woman of my dreams We rearly disagree nevermind argue I have a promising career in the military joined an elite infantry unit the Ranger Regiment part of special operations briagde Have been awarded a 2 star commendation

text body: Hi everyone I d really appreciate some advice Context My mom comes from a family with a long history of mental illness schizophrenia bipolar disorder etc and was always labeled as crazy My dad is an alcoholic and can be extremely uncaring like refusing to pick me up from the hospital after surgery when I was a kid not going to my sister s college graduation and even trying to give my other sister up for adoption because she was a troubled teenager They made sure we were fed clothed celebrated our birthdays hugged us and told us they loved us But they also beat us screamed constantly and fought with each other all the time Their fights were terrifying when I was little I remember my mom screaming she was going to kill my dad and him handing her a knife and daring her to do it Or her pouring gasoline on him while he slept drunk and saying she was going to set him on fire My sisters and I would cry and beg them not to hurt each other When I was around 8 or 9 I started stepping in to stop the fights Usually my dad being drunk triggered them so I d wait for him to get home and quietly take care of him so my mom wouldn t wake up and start screaming Eventually it became normal she d even send me to deal with him This is just a glimpse of what we went through I could fill pages with stories like these Why am I telling you all this Because my sisters and I grew up completely messed up And my dad refuses to acknowledge any of it I m 24 now When we were younger and struggling badly with our mental health we went through a phase of saying this is all your fault And it was My dad used to ignore it but now that we re older he says we re disrespectful liars who treat him and my mom like they re monsters He even agrees that the things we say if they were true would make them terrible parents But he just refuses to believe or admit that they actually did those things We had a big fight recently and he said we shouldn t talk to him anymore if we think he s so horrible It s not the first time he s said that Usually I just act like nothing happened after a while and he goes back to acting normal too But I know my dad If I don t take the initiative to fix things this time he really won t talk to me again I m tired This is making me sick emotionally and mentally I m already struggling even though I m doing better than I was as a child I still love him despite everything and I don t want to cut him off But his refusal to admit what he did and how cruel he could be is breaking me What should I do A bit about my mom We managed to convince her to see a psychiatrist when I was about 15 After starting medication she slowly got better Over time she began to realize how wrong her actions were She s very remorseful now She still causes drama sometimes and occasionally says things like That s in the past I don t know why you and your sister still cry about it but overall she s a hundred times better than she used to be And just to clarify the reason all of this keeps coming up is because my sisters and I still struggle deeply with mental health issues We re trying to build a healthy mindset now but we were never taught one It s like building something from scratch We re quick to anger like our mom I m never physically aggressive I hate aggression it makes me anxious but my older sister is we yell when upset we struggle with keeping our homes clean just like our parents did We grew up in a pretty dirty house and those habits are hard to unlearn I don t know what to do because I love them very much but I don t think I ll ever be able to get better around them I m a woman by the way",24.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: I don t know how to explain it I opened a new account to ask people about this but as you can see on the title my little brother beats the shit out of me My brother was the sweetest kid growing up but ever since my parents got him a PC I can t recognize him anymore He gets mad so easily provocative beats the shit out of me without any hesitation and after a couple of hours he comes to hug and kiss me Today we were playing Roblox in his room with his computer and he sweared to someone and I told him not to he then pretended to punch me hard in the face and said Sometimes I want to do that to you The moment this happened I thought is this boy going to be a murderer when he grows up Then I took my chair to go to my room and then he provoked me by saying stuff about my weight 5 7 120lbs but it doesn t matter he shouldn t have said those things even though if I was overweight Then I pushed him and then we started fighting As we fighted my mom came from the living room and started recording us and then I took her phone The moment I took it my brother slammed me to the ground started squeezing my waist so hard I couldn t breathe Then when I refused to give back the phone and fought back he got angrier and started choking me I screamed to my mom and she didn t do anything She didn t even try to stop him I blacked out I don t know what to do I don t know if I m living with a future murderer under the same roof",17.0,female,sister,10-19

text body: I F24 live in the UK in the same house as my mum F53 I m autistic and have ADHD I get benefits but they go into her bank account because she doesn t want me to work I don t even know how much I get per month because she won t tell me When she was married to my dad she used to cheat on him and would sext married men She still does it and one time was even planning to have sex with a guy not much older than me in my house while I was asleep in the next room Didn t know this guy from Adam and he could ve been a rapist or anything so I didn t feel safe There was also a guy she d been seeing for a couple of weeks when I was 17 who always commented on how beautiful I was and saying he d have to chase boys away he was 48 and she let him stay overnight despite my protests and the fact she d only known him for 2 weeks I really want to move out but with my circumstances it s so hard to get my own place My mum loves to tell everyone I m autistic and makes out I m much worse than I am in order to seek sympathy and validation I was on holiday with my family and my boyfriend and she tried to take my bra off in front of my dad because I had chest pain I pushed her hands away and she said I attacked her My dad and my boyfriend were pissed off with her for trying to take off my bra in front of my dad and how uncomfortable it made me She is also an absolute clean freak and has too much energy always playing her music too loud I find her very overwhelming My boyfriend M27 may have undiagnosed autism and he even gets overwhelmed by my mum She accused him of being ignorant and having no respect for her but he just doesn t know how to deal with her and he said she treats me like I m 12 which concerns him yet it s okay when her friend s son who she s wanted me to be with since we were children to be a completely rude prick and she ll talk about how much of a lovely successful handsome boy he is She forced me to kiss him at her wedding when I was 4 and you can clearly see me looking uncomfortable and leaning away in the picture and I got in trouble for being rude It really fucked up my understanding of consent because a girl sexually abused me when I was 9 and then my ex raped me three and a half years ago and I felt really uncomfortable telling her She tries to guilt trip me into being friends with her best friend s daughter who was bombarding me with messages which overwhelmed me she has a learning disability so I don t think she understood my boundaries or my personal space which absolutely wasn t her fault but we have absolutely nothing in common either As a child she never showed me how to do household tasks so I don t know how to do some things I don t know if she genuinely forgot or it was some kind of deliberate ploy so that I can t leave I m never allowed to be unwell have a migraine which I get quite a lot be forgetful due to my ADHD or be tired without being accused of being lazy She constantly accuses me of things I didn t do and I have to shout the truth at her until I m blue in the face She also accuses me of laughing at her when I haven t I don t know what to do I feel so stuck and I can t even get my own place because I don t know how much money I get and I m not allowed a job She s also my appointee and wanted herself and my brother to get guardianship of me I just want to be treated like a normal woman for fuck sake I can t stand the pitiful looks I get from random people that know her but don t even know me",24.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: Hi I 16f have had a few reoccurring issues with my sister A 14f Basically I d say we have a pretty dysfunctional home life and because of that I m gone most of the time staying with my grandparents A stays at our house but for the past 3 weeks I ve been staying around my house It s not as if I never saw her I d come home on Wednesdays and Weekends and other random nights and most of the time we d have an argument but it seems to be way worse now that I m at home a lot She s always been pretty irritable but as of this school year it s been ramping up to the point even our parents comment on it I ll be the first to say I know she a lot of different factors going on she just switched schools because she never seems to find a place she quite likes Meaning she s mostly getting up at like 5 in the morning A lot of the house work tends to fall on her as well but since I ve been home I ve been trying to help though this week I ve really fallen back on it I understand it could be resentment for her responsibilities after all I don t think one person should be expected to handle the house work But I don t know other than that she doesn t really like me specifically I guess She gets along with our older sister most days and when she s not being mouthy she s also good with my mom and dad so I guess it probably has something to do with me I just want to help but it seems she doesn t wanna hang out unless she needs something like HW help or wants me to make her food Otherwise she s snappy and always seems annoyed in my presence It kinda culminated today or more of last night She was snappish again yesterday and I needed clothes for today so when looking around I found some of her clothes on the bathroom floor Part of it was that I need more to throw in the load other part is I figured it might relieve some of the stress So I threw it in with my stuff and made sure they were dry in the morning Well at like 5 am she wakes me up and I guess kinda snaps at me asking where I put it It was early and I just remember her being upset and the flashlight in my face but I assume I tell her Later today when everyone s home she comes into my room and starts looking around claiming she needed to see if I stole anything from her room She finds a bronzer which my older sister told me I could have but I assume she gave it to both of us and a claw clip that had been in the bathroom along with all the rest of the communal things menstrual products toothbrush s etc We have a bit of a spat that results in me telling her to go or I d call my dad but later tonight I had dropped off something in my older sisters room which is right next to A s and find the socks I had thrown in with the load from last night on the floor So I go find her and she s about to shower and I am a bit snappish I know that if I wanna fix things I have to put best foot forwards and she seems to have had a hard night and it ends up in another fight where she lists all the things she had gotten in a fight with out mom about and asking if I was going to say them as well I don t I kinda just stand there because this is how about 60 of all our arguments go I ll get upset and then she ll kinda just shut down just to get me to leave and then she won t fix whatever she s done I end up just point out she was being a hypocrite and she says she s had a stressful night and I argue that she s always stress and keep asking when we get a conversation she says I don t I point out the fact that the only time she seems to wanna talk to me is when she needs something She then points out that it s the same and can only argue doing all my chores so I argue back that since I ve been back I ve also taken back most of my chores It goes back and forth till finally I just ask if anything I ll say she ll take as a personal attack against her and she just says it is I want to have a good relationship with her because she is one of the coolest and kindest people I know but I know she resents me for a lot of things I wanna know how this looks to an outsider because I m aware that some of what I do is wrong but I am biased I ll take any perspectives even if they re cursing me to hell and back I just want to fix this TLDR Had a spat with my sister and I realize they all kinda go like this curious as what I can do to fix it",16.0,female,sister,10-19

I hate my brother - Need some advice?,"title: I hate my brother - Need some advice?
author: Least_Ad3500
text body: I cannot stand my F19 younger brother M17 For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers F46 mental illness and various crises she s experiences and our fathers M52 general absence We don t have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me To be clear my brother I ll call X for simplicity has no known mental illnesses disabilities or other issues that would delay mental emotional development I have been diagnosed with GAD OCD and depression My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house For context My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard all while doing nothing to assist So this being the situation it was expected that the kids being me and X would clean the house However for no known reason except X s own selfishness and presumed laziness the chores would fall to me If the house was not kept to a certain and often unknown standard I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment I say no known because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X Following suit as we ve grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me My mother being in her free girl and spiritual era has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about Being that I have OCD one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough I am also in my third year of University currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85 I have explained to both my mom and X I don t bother with my dad because he s not in the picture right not how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes Earlier today the event that prompted me to write this I was at work Around 11 30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse Typically when I message him he won t respond so he can claim he didn t see the text At 11 50 I messaged him again reminding him of what was asked I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded I asked him kindly again to unload the dished He told me to fuck off This is not the first time this has happened I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house To be clear this kid has school from 9 11 having a third period spare meaning he has a 2 hour lunch He is in grade 12 or a senior we are from Canada When I was in grade 12 I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework He sits of the couch and either a sleeps or b plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans not sure if that s what its called I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called self centred and from my mom I get a I will talk to him or a lay off of him In my opinion nothing has changed I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues which she fucking knew about and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me This job was also 30 minutes away from my house I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time it felt like the end of the world So far X has looked for two jobs One being at the end of his grade 11 year this one was promised to him but fell through and is my moms words disappointed him and makes him not want to try again and then again recently dropping his resume off at a dollarama It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school keeping my grades above a 95 average I know it was only high school however it still took quite a bit of time and energy working around 25 hours a week and keeping the house clean He has no job is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes and has no responsibilities around the house My second issue is his choice of words He often uses slurs such as the r n f I the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada and many more He is a cis het white male for any context While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities it is still incredibly harmful I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world He is unfortunately falling down the alt right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it He consistently refers to me and my mom as bitches and to me as a fat fuck or a slut whore Again words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now let alone when I was 17 I would be screamed at My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep Since I was in grade 4 I have been getting myself X and my mom up in time for school My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up feed the pets Dogs and cats let them out to play make mine and X s lunch for the day make myself breakfast X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up We are out the door by 8 25am As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day Thankfully as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something I still hate being late let the record be known However I have not been in Gen Ed for nearly 3 years now and still have to wake X up My mom thankfully has gotten better however she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession beginning the process of waking him up at 7 30 to give him an extra half hour pulling the blankets off him spraying him with water which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist yelling and using a very loud alarm Nothing works He never wakes up I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5 30am I am so fucking tired I don t even know what to do I don t know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop I don t know how much I can take of this anymore I just want to be a kid and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can t keep doing this",19.0,female,sibling,10-19

text body: This will be the final update to this situation In short we re going to get a divorce My 32M husband 33M is much worse than I thought he was All of you who said I was in the wrong for giving him more chances You were all right Our relationship is beyond fixing After my last update I continued doing what I said I d do focus on my sister 24F and on figuring myself out I left my phone open for only my sister both of my SILs 28 and 18F and work Things didn t get any easier and if anything the letter my husband passed me and the fact that SIL2 read it and felt awful made everything worse and harder I still wanted to give my husband a chance I love him We ve been together for twelve years I wanted to calm down and talk to him I wanted to ask that piece of shit why he told my sister to stay away from me and why he pretended to speak on my behalf Even if it didn t change anything I wanted answers I was giving him the benefit of the doubt I was hoping there was some explanation we could work through that didn t end in divorce Anything I love him He was the first person I ever felt like I was at home with after leaving home at 18 He s tried to get in contact with me multiple times through SIL1 and SIL2 but besides telling me husband is trying to get us to pass messages to you they didn t cooperate with him I m thankful for that I wasn t in the mindspace to hear anything about him I was too upset Both of them are very angry at him too specially SIL1 who can t forgive him for the horrific things he said about little siblings in the letter SIL2 read SIL1 adores SIL2 She s trying to pretend reading that nonsense didn t hurt her too but I m sure reading her own brother say those awful things hurt her too SIL1 s just the type to hurt silently To summarize a long story on Saturday SIL1 called me and said my in laws MIL and FIL needed to talk to me about my husband And that even though I don t want to hear about him it was urgent So I went over to their place and we had lunch together SIL1 was there too After they found out about the entire fiasco after SIL2 read the damn letter they ve been talking a lot to my husband Apparently he wasn t the good older brother he seemed to be his whole life MIL and FIL told me that when SIL1 was born my husband wasn t happy with her That s kinda normal for kids but it appears he resented her and pretended she didn t exist for well into his teens Same with SIL2 when she was born and he was 15 by then It seems like he s always always been overly jealous of them and overly jealous in general SIL1 never told me this because she thought her brother was over it and that it wouldn t affect me and our relationship now that he s an adult in his 30s She was wrong I m not blaming her he did seem remarkably normal when I met him and I wouldn t have even suspected he was the one behind my sister s distance with me if SIL1 hadn t told me immediately Anyway besides being abnormally jealous of his little sisters once he got to like them MIL and FIL told me my husband would go as far as to keep his friends away from the house and go out of his way to not invite them because he was scared his friends would like his sisters better than him or that his sisters would like his friends better MIL and FIL tried getting him to go to therapy when they found out but he refused to talk to his therapist SIL1 only found that out recently She didn t know why she never got to meet her brother s friends After finding out his pathological jealousy was still in action when they found out about what my husband did to my sister when the whole situation exploded with the letter they ve been talking to him and prodding him to tell them why he felt so threatened by my little sister While he was closed off at first he s always caved in to confiding in MIL Basically when he met me and learnt of my broken relationship with my family he thought I was perfect because he would never have to share me He never said anything to this effect in the past twelve years He s always expressed sympathy for my situation and when I told him I wanted to reach out to my sister again he encouraged me Retrospectively all this is terrifying The worst part is why he snapped when he did however He told me it was because I had a sleepover with my sister on a night he wasn t supposed to be home and that I couldn t put my sister over my husband Apparently that was a lie He told MIL the truth and this is what convinced me to divorce him A few weeks before the sleepover night SIL1 SIL2 husband my sister and I went out for drinks We all overdid it a little but I drank more than all of them and passed out on the table at the club before we left While SIL1 and SIL2 were at the bathroom my husband asked my sister why she wasn t drinking and she confessed to my husband that she has a brain tumor It isn t very dangerous for now and it doesn t interfere too much with her daily life she s on epilepsy meds and that s mostly contained the problem so she s on the watch and wait approach Treatment will vary depending on if or when it starts growing and how quickly She told him she was scared of telling me because since I walked out on her when she was little she s terrified that I ll walk out on her again if she becomes too much of a problem He promised her he d help her tell me when she felt ready Instead since he and I have been considering adoption for a while he told MIL that he didn t want me getting distracted from his family if my sister s tumor progresses and that it was better to get rid of her before she took all my attention Plus that it would be cruel for his kids to get attached to their aunt if she s as good as gone I broke down When I calmed down enough I went home packed some bags and got on the first flight to the country that bastard sent my sister running off to when he told her she was taking up too much space I basically appeared on her doorstep and hugged her the moment she opened the door We spoke a lot over the weekend and I told her she isn t a problem She put me up to date with her situation and told me she didn t want to be a problem and that she doesn t want to get between me and my family The only person who got between me and my family was my exhusband My sister did nothing wrong I m going to stay by her side come what may I had to be back home on Monday for work I m trying to get working remotely set up so I can move to my sister s city I don t know how much time we have left before that thing starts growing I hope it won t but I m not the most optimistic guy Whatever happens I won t leave her alone When I told her I wanted to stay with her she also broke down I m never leaving her again I ve started talking to a lawyer for

text body: 20F I found out yesterday that I ve been disowned This was after I had an argument with my dad in a pharmacy he embarrassed me by answering for me very loud in the back and making it clear to them I have some sort of speech issue i don t she didn t hear one number of my birth year but he still think I m 11 and introverted I told him to go outside and because I had some authority in my voice now he was embarrassed We ve never argued in public so it was worse in that sense but he made sure to call me every bad thing he could think of right there in Arabic My dad told my mom either I leave this Friday or he will Of course it s not a question even though he works maybe 14 hours a month my family depend on him emotionally and financially But I just don t think what happened is enough ground to remove me Just before that we were talking about the weather and when I would take my driving test Nothing leading up It s true that we don t have the best relationship anyway my dad spends most of his time saying I stink or my uni work is a waste of time because it s not a big uni or when I almost got married off in January not willing all the pictures I had were either catfish to him or ugly Even said he ll have to stick a picture of you on the bedframe so he doesn t have to think about what lays next to him And when I cried and complained he said it was all a joke of course Somehow I should ve known that Point is despite this rant I don t think I did enough to be disowned I do see it as some misogyny because my brother has had similar or worse arguments and he never experienced some sort of silent treatment I get this from my dad and my mom the latter sometimes worse as she d ignore me months at a time Even in the house I ve been confined to my room I m not allowed out for dinners or prayer he doesn t want to see me My mom was upset mostly because I didn t do enough I should ve cried more begged more But when he asked me to leave I did and I immediately started searching for my options I have options already and I m trying to get my benefits sorted so I can get into shared housing until I can find work as I only just finished uni and still haven t graduated My two brothers have avoided me since Worst part about this is I have a new baby sister that s 2 months and having been an only girl my whole life I looked forward to raising her and seeing her grow and hear her call me sister And I won t get that anymore What can I do right now what should I be doing Edit guess I got renowned didn t have to go anywhere because my mom managed to convince my dad she d need my help in the house with my sister to deal with because of course we ethnics don t teach our men about housework So I m back in under rules of a supreme maid talk quietly cook and clean without being asked or reminded and do everything as told Mind you I said if you want a maid I ll hire one and ofc it got worse But yeah with my financial status I ll be stuck here a little longer but thank you to everyone for the advice I ll keep it in mind for next time soon enough 3",20.0,female,daughter,20-29
My Father Lost His Mind and I Don’t Know How to Procceed,"title: My Father Lost His Mind and I Don’t Know How to Procceed
author: DraftMany925
text body: This post is going to come off a little trauma dumpy but I am very desperate for advice so just a little disclaimer in advance Edit I go off on some tangents so please excuse my inability to just simply tell the story My father 42 for the last couple of years has been on the mental decline At first it seemed like something you would see in someone much older repeating questions or phrases several times in a row and not noticing Having horrible memory seemingly dropping intelligence significantly and all that That gave me initially just the kind of slight annoyance you get with having to deal with that especially of someone so young But as the years went by it changed more and more alarmingly as time went on The first I became aware of the changes was when I was roughly 19 or 20 I am 21 now for reference and he nearly killed me in a drunk driving episode Context I got in the car with him Not knowing he was drunk because he never really was a drinker and immediately he started swerving down the rode Again didn t think much of it because he always drives on his phone and is general a abysmal driver But after side swiping a semi trailer and hitting a guard rail I became painfully aware of him drinking I am a very reserved and shy person and hate confrontation so I didn t say anything even after I knew and became so terrified I started violently trembling This led to him berating me about being scared of him when he noticed my trembling and even threatening me Eventually he drove straight there the red light on a four lane intersection and that was the final straw until I threatened to call the police on him and he reluctantly handed over the wheel I am summarizing a bit but this was the day I truly started to put an assortment of events and things he d done together and notice the decline of his mental stability After this transpired he began to develop what I can only explain as the mind of a child Also Homelander from The Boys is a great representation of what he is like if you ve watched the show He developed in insatiable need to feel accomplished and loved by everyone around him while constantly treating everyone and everything like human garbage I ll give a couple examples He makes dinner once every three months or so and when he finally gets everyone to eat he will force my family to say how good the meal was over ten times sometimes more the most he ever forced my mother to praise him was nearly 15 times by slamming the table and giving death stares until he is somewhat satisfied by our forced false praise Another example is my mother is a softball coach and my sister plays for the team she coaches This is important because one obviously I want to support my sister so I would go to games to watch her And every single game I swear to you for hours and game after game he would do nothing but complain about my mother not acknowledging him sitting in the stand when she is in the middle of coaching a team of young teenage girls during a game And he would complain and complain about how no one cared about him because people who pay attention to my sister during her own softball games On the topic of my sister he is extremely misogynistic and is very demeaning of women in general Does not comprehend periods and will belittle my sister for simply using women hygiene products that kind of behavior This will be a final example to kind of illustrate the picture to what kind of a person he is but I have two wonderful dogs who are unfathomably intelligent Border collies So admittedly they are much more behaved than a normal dog Completely understand any command you give them will come back in the house if you call for them that kind of thing But despite them being so well behaved it isn t enough for my father who began to hit them for misbehaving even though they have rarely so much as have an accident My one dog has seizures not because of brain damage he caused but goes to show he is willing to hit an epileptic dog This caused my one dog to cower and hide from him at every opportunity and this enrages him Going back to needing to be constantly showered in praise and affection while treating everyone like garbage I know I said last example from the past but I ll give another while I m thinking about it treating others like garbage but expecting everyone to love him He will make quick comments like another story but he has gone up to my sister and said phrases along the lines of You re horrible at softball or you have no friends Elementary school bully behavior and will immediately go to another tangent and expect everyone to happily listen and talk with him as if he didn t insult the person he was talking to Now you probably get an idea of how he s been acting in the past I ll fast forward to the last week and his life is seemingly more of the rails than ever He now talks to himself will make sounds for no reason he ll stand and shake like a psychotic movie character Every sentence he speaks is like speaking to either an 8 year old or and 88 year old no sentence really means much of anything But on Friday he quit his job completely left everything at our job site and just quit We work the same job unfortunately There was no planning no nothing my mother didn t know I didn t know I learned from a text he sent my coworker that he completely quit He spent the first couple days mindlessly scrolling YouTube shorts and today he was drunkenly sprawled out on the living room floor making noises Also he yelled at me for beginning to cook dinner because he wanted hot dogs and I should have know that s what he wanted But now that I am at this point I am completely dumbfounded on what to do I am 90 sure he has psychosis or something along the lines of it My sister insists he is bipolar which she is right Now the problem is my mother has been a stay at home mom since before he started going off the deep end and is still that Which means I am the only one in the house with a job as a 21 year old guy My father basically burned every bridge he had at his last job and is now too mentally unwell at least I think to ever be hired somewhere else And now I m finding hundreds of dollars worth of lottery tickets alcohol fast food of his just laying around He is also seemingly becoming more violent I came up with an excuse last Friday to not ride in to work in the same car as him because of trauma and all that but I put on a happy face and gave a legitimate excuse This caused him to not openly show it but he stood in the doorway eyes bulging and body twitching and as I was getting ready I heard him under his breath say I m going to fucking murder him over something as trivial as that So the conclusion to my book Or for anyone unwilling to read the entire story which I understand My father who is almost definitely psychotic left his job is becoming increasingly unstable and potentially violent basically ruined every relationship and opportunity he has in life Leaving me to one just wanting to get out of the house and leave and never come back But I m terrified of what might happen to my sister or mom if he continues to worsen Not only am I scared he may become violent to them I m terrified I ll have to financially care for them if he snaps I do have 45k saved up from working full time since high school Which seems like a lot at first but to start a new independent life and care for my family seems impossible to me Also I have never confronted him about his behavior because he is severely depressed and I feel like if confront him about his behavior he will legitimately kill himself So I can t get him to see anyone about his mental stability to fix our problems that way without him crashing out on me for even suggesting it And I truly am at the point where I know it s wrong to feel this way but I do not have any want or incentive to help him anymore It feels like a waste of my time So I suppose I m just very lost I m terrified for my sister and mother s future and don t know how to escape this chapter of my life If anyone has experience like this I would love to know your approach Also I m skipping out on a large amount of details and events so if there is context I left out in my rambling then let me know please Thank you anyone who is willing to read my trauma dump you are incredibly kind",21.0,male,son,20-29

author: Double2k
text body: I put NSFW just due to explicit background FYI my Dad s side of the family is a fucking wreck as you are about to find out Also for clarification I have 3 siblings 22M diagnosed with autism M40 half brother F40 crackhead estranged sister I recognize if any of them sees this I wont escape it lol but whatever at this point idc I 24M have a transgender half brother M40 who no one in my family knew about until I was 3 y o He was the result of a one night fling 40 years ago My dad M62 and my half brother have both tried to reconcile over the years multiple times lived together for a time and stayed on ok terms for a bit However around 5 years ago when visiting my half brother my dad said something to piss him off he freaked out on him they got in an intense punching fight while I was sleeping and we left the next day We didn t hear from my half brother for like 4 years however they had apparently reconciled during that time Anyways fast forward and my 16 year old cousin committed suicide Over the years my half brother and one of my cousins family on my dad s side had gotten very close with one another and the kids would frequently visit him every summer for a couple weeks My half brother contacts me and shares the news with me first and we got back in touch ever since chatting every week or so During this period he and my dad tried to reconcile as well and went on a family vacation During this vacation allegedly my dad was extremely drunk the entire trip and consistently made vulgar and transphobic comments towards my brother the entire trip Apparently he would walk around the apartment with his dick out disturbing my brother When my brother called him out on it he made vulgar comments to him waved his dick around in his robe and taunted him From my Dad s side again allegedly my half brother was the issue He walked around the apartment would not put up his robe and let his boobs hang out the entire time in front of my dad and his friend They were disgusted by it told him to cover up and he refused Ever since then they have both hated each others guts Here is where I fall into play I have stayed on great terms with my half brother at least on his end He constantly says how much he loves me is glad we have stayed connected and can t wait until my dad dies and we can take all his money Yeah I m not all about that My dad has stated numerous times my half brother is not getting anything its all going to me etc However further caveat we have no idea if he has even created a will or not As of the time he and my mom split up 4 years ago he did not have a will He claims to have made one but it never goes past it s taken care of No proof of anything We highly doubt he does We highly suspect its not and as a result the will is going to be split between everyone With all that being said fast forward to the past 2 months My half brother called me and told me that my half sister the crackhead was recently manipulated she has severe mental disabilities due to excessive meth usage and taken out of a hospital by a creep with multiple sexual assault charges who took her back to his place in the middle of the woods and raped her This is someone who I have not had any contact with for 15 years outside of family funerals where she was strictly prohibited by my parents from talking to me My half brother used this to get in contact with my dad s side of the family and basically guilt tripped my dad into taking her in He spent over 1 000 getting her out paying for Ubers hotels etc Apparently every six months she calls him begging for help because she gets kicked out of shelters either for A relapsing or B having seizures from her epilepsy he claims shelters won t take her because of the liability I m skeptical But anyway he used this situation to pressure the family until my dad agreed to take her in She s been staying with him for the past couple weeks Also worth mentioning I have a full brother 22M who s autistic and is not aware of any of this however he loves my half brother and hates my dad I will fully admit my dad plays favorites has clearly established me as his favorite and for the most part ignored my full brother because he cant relate to him due to his autism I m in no way saying I believe my dad is either a good or bad person My dad keeps saying he s not leaving my half brother anything but if there s no will that s probably not enforceable Meanwhile my mom keeps telling me I need to protect myself She believes my dad s version of events more than my half brother s thinks he exaggerates a lot but admits some parts are probably true She s also convinced he s going to try to guilt me or pressure me into giving him money if when my dad passes and the inheritance is settled don t need to convince me I already know this is going to happen She also is really pissed at my dad because if he doesn t have a will she knows I am going to have to go through hell dealing with both my half brother and especially my half sister who is a wild card She basically told me You are the only responsible one left and they are both going to come after you for money the second dad dies which I fully realize and agree with her on thank god she is a stable good person and a badass mom At this point im stuck in this mess and will have to deal with it one day whether or not thats in 6 months 6 years or 20 years he drinks to much to make it that long to be real I care about my half brother and we ve stayed close but I m really worried that not giving him money will end the relationship or turn him against me Even worse I know that he will very likely use that information to turn my entire dad s side of the family against me who some of them I do really like I just haven t had the opportunity to know them due to completely separate family drama At the same time I don t owe my half brother anything I am not responsible he and my dad s emotional instability Im not responsible for my dad having a one night stand and my half brother being completely unaccepting of the fact that his biological father for the most part wants nothing to do with him Alot of this is me venting but really I just want some outside opinions I really don t know how to handle this Is it even possible to have a relationship with my half brother while knowing the second I get an inheritance its either pay up or have him hate me for life Am I just delaying the inevitable Is it even possible to stay close to him TLDR I m the favorite kid stuck in the middle of a chaotic family My half brother expects inheritance money when my dad dies but I know giving him nothing could destroy our relationship and turn my distant family cousins aunts uncles whom I like against me Not sure if staying close is even possible without paying up",24.0,male,son,20-29
Aita for being upset with my father over birthdays ?,"title: Aita for being upset with my father over birthdays ?
author: LetterheadAlert2974
text body: So I m 23f and my father is 53m Since I was a kid I have loved birthdays Even if it is something simple I like dressing up getting a nice cake making a cute back drop for pictures and also going out to eat dinner So it starts with my 19th birthday covid had just ended and 3 of my friends came home to surprise me All my family was also there My grandparents uncle aunt cousins But my father had gone out for some work I waited for him to cut my cake he didn t come back home Mom called him and told me he was busy And later I found out he was helping out his friend plan for his daughter s wedding menu I was very upset Cried a lot and didn t talk to him Then came my 20th I was already in university by then and just came home for my birthday It started nicely he got me a cake to cut at midnight I ordered a nice cake for the actual birthday And I told him I just want to go out for a dinner just the 4 of us My dad mom me and my little sister I like going to nice small restaurants because they serve nice food I don t like 5 stars or 7 stars because the food is bland and you can t talk loudly or enjoy They have classical music in the background which also I don t enjoy Still I let that go And them I find out he had invited his friends and business partners to surprise me mind you they are people I don t even like All I wanted was a quiet dinner with my family And in order to attend his guests we didn t even get to talk all the time I don t even have a picture of the 4 of us Now comes my 21st again because I love my birthday cakes I designed it myself ordered it And I got an idea my family was planning something So I gave them subtle hints about which people I would never want on my birthdays Again it started of nicely Even my bestfriend came home to wish me The thing they told me was that we will yo out for a family dinner my grandmother parents my uncles family me my sister and my elder cousin When we reach at the location it s a huge party With all of my fathers side of the family his friends and business partners and also the people I told them I don t like And none of my friends was invited One of them I know has tried to touch me and my sister and looks at my mom weirdly I had told my father this but he didn t listen to me And still invited him Again it was a huge party so it didn t affect me that much But here it comes I looked at my birthday cake it was beautiful I click pictures with it And when I go to cit my cake this girl around 7 to 8 years old the relative of that same guy whom he brought with himself without being invited Holds the knife and wants to cut the cake I look at my father and he is like let it be I get really upset and just leave to see the only relative from my mom s side of the family who had just arrived And later he scolded me for over reacting and leaving from there He said that she was just a child and if he asked that child to move away it could have made the man unhappy and he wouldn t risk his relationship with that guy for a cake But it was a big deal for me Then comes my 22nd birthday the worst of all of these I made a sketch of the cake I wanted And I was going to order it but my father told me that he will do it this time I was not feeling good about it but I let him because he does not like being told no He called me a day before and asked me what I want to do and who I want there I told him about a new place that had opened up and I like it And just our family and one of my cousins family there The place I liked was a roof top cafe which had a nice vibe and good music I especially told him that I did not want to go to a fine dine five star hotel I was having a very bad day because my best friend had not wished me and was feeling very sad We leave home he picks up the cake at the last moment and takes a long time there We reach and it s a five star hotel and again other than the cousins family there are two other families who I don t even know I was having a bad day and I start getting upset It was again the classical music and bland food So he starts telling my uncle that I am so ungrateful And how he does so much for me but I never appreciate him Mind you I always appreciated his efforts even if I didn t like it And then comes the breaking point I wanted to take pictures of the cake for my instagram and I open the box and it was a random cake Mind you didn t even have my name on it Not even the flavor I told him I don t know what happened I started breaking down and I leave the table quietly and ho to the washroom and cry My cousins and my sister follow me And later I cut that cake just so that the others don t feel bad He didn t even give me an explanation for why he did that Coming to my 23rd I decorated my room myself ordered my cake and just asked my parents to come home before 12 as my sister was at her university and I would be alone at home They went out to celebrate a friend s birthday They don t come home until 1 o clock in the night and I was alone And just because I told him that he always finds a way to spoil my birthdays and that he can never even do the bare minimum he got upset and didn t even wish me Although he did post on social media To show people what a doting father he is All I had previously asked was a bouquet of my favorite flowers and he didn t get them for me I spent the whole day crying in between the calls I got from my family and friends and trying to sound normal so that no one gets to know I m upset I didn t even get a hug from my parents that day I travel for my birthday every year for 8 hours to come home And that s what I get My mom tries her best she takes me to the salon gets me cloths gets my nails done But she never speaks against my dad I m tired of this I was once the girl who loved birthdays and now I hate them I just want to know if I am in the wrong Am I behaving like a brat Am I the AH",23.0,female,daughter,20-29

I was obviously excited about this new relationship Some of her biggest gripes were that he s nothing more in her mind than a backwoods redneck and essentially that I m too good for him But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long time Jehovah s Witnesses Ever since I told her this she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had Example A She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up I told her no it really wasn t his thing and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork construction that he does now and never took much of an interest in sports She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn t done any sports since he couldn t do anything that would put him around being people that weren t JW I know this is true within the religion but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young I ve tried to explain this as not true but she simply won t accept it Example B I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in After dating for almost a year I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living Ever since I ve moved and especially after I told her about our engagement all she does is say that I ve been sucked in She s convinced I m in a cult She s also said she hates my ex boyfriend who cheated on me to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him Example C Since starting working post college I ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into fundraising and I haven t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before I ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home since I have learned that cleaning cooking and decorating are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall She says I m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from even after I had said many times I didn t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new and find a nice boy down there to settle down with Example D Since announcing our engagement she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare When I told her our initial wedding date she asked why we were rushing it I told her we just didn t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married She grilled me and said I must be pregnant and what happened to having a long engagement She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and or borderline personality disorder She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer we live 4 5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up she told me it was already too late this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating She s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family When we weren t speaking a couple months back she didn t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because I didn t ask how the dog was I never got a chance to say goodbye Before this she had previously called me at 12 30 am after we hadn t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent 10 000 at the casino Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should ve never asked All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself our relationship as he calls it When I told my mother the date she said it was too soon and that she didn t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn t help me with the wedding I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would and she said yes I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors While this was true after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship Ever since we ve been arguing pretty consistently The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement He s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I m in But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I m going to be loyal to him not to my mom The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some and he s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to since it is a small town here My in laws are absolutely incredible and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom We often go out to lunch together and just spend a lot of time together overall Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing My mom is my only family since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn t close with any of her siblings and all my grandparents are gone I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else How do I prove myself to my fiancé How do I stick up to my mother and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her Can I salvage a relationship with both of them My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me like being the parent that stayed when my dad left But I also love my fiancé more than anything and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us He s said he s just been in a down mood in general he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness I ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings Thank you in advance for any advice",22.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: Background My partner F44 and I F33 have been together for 6 years have a 2 year old that I carried and am the primary caregiver for I m mostly a SAHM mom though I m working a bit more now as our kid gets a little older I have always been clear that I want 2 kids my partner is pretty clear that going through that first year again isn t something she can handle I think part of it is her personality and part of it is related to our age gap she just doesn t have a lot of stamina for sleep deprivation or really any of the challenges of having a young baby She s way happier and more functional as a parent now that we re through the baby stage and have a walking talking kiddo We ve talked a lot about having a second kid She understands that it s not something I feel willing to compromise on and has agreed to a second baby if I basically handle all the sleep stuff and give her a lot of allowances around weekends away with friends sleeping in self care etc basically the offer is that she is willing to have a second kid as long as I do basically all the work for that first year She works 40 50 hrs per week and does a ton around the house and the yard garden so not a dead beat by any means but obviously this would still be a pretty unbalanced setup Is this a ridiculous thing to agree to Has anyone heard of this kind of agreement Is this basically what most people end up doing anyway without really communicating about it Confused about how to move forward",33.0,female,mother,30-39

text body: I cannot stand my F19 younger brother M17 For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers F46 mental illness and various crises she s experiences and our fathers M52 general absence We don t have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me To be clear my brother I ll call X for simplicity has no known mental illnesses disabilities or other issues that would delay mental emotional development I have been diagnosed with GAD OCD and depression My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house For context My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard all while doing nothing to assist So this being the situation it was expected that the kids being me and X would clean the house However for no known reason except X s own selfishness and presumed laziness the chores would fall to me If the house was not kept to a certain and often unknown standard I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment I say no known because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X Following suit as we ve grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me My mother being in her free girl and spiritual era has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about Being that I have OCD one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough I am also in my third year of University currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85 I have explained to both my mom and X I don t bother with my dad because he s not in the picture right not how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes Earlier today the event that prompted me to write this I was at work Around 11 30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse Typically when I message him he won t respond so he can claim he didn t see the text At 11 50 I messaged him again reminding him of what was asked I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded I asked him kindly again to unload the dished He told me to fuck off This is not the first time this has happened I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house To be clear this kid has school from 9 11 having a third period spare meaning he has a 2 hour lunch He is in grade 12 or a senior we are from Canada When I was in grade 12 I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework He sits of the couch and either a sleeps or b plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans not sure if that s what its called I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called self centred and from my mom I get a I will talk to him or a lay off of him In my opinion nothing has changed I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues which she fucking knew about and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me This job was also 30 minutes away from my house I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time it felt like the end of the world So far X has looked for two jobs One being at the end of his grade 11 year this one was promised to him but fell through and is my moms words disappointed him and makes him not want to try again and then again recently dropping his resume off at a dollarama It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school keeping my grades above a 95 average I know it was only high school however it still took quite a bit of time and energy working around 25 hours a week and keeping the house clean He has no job is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes and has no responsibilities around the house My second issue is his choice of words He often uses slurs such as the r n f I the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada and many more He is a cis het white male for any context While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities it is still incredibly harmful I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world He is unfortunately falling down the alt right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it He consistently refers to me and my mom as bitches and to me as a fat fuck or a slut whore Again words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now let alone when I was 17 I would be screamed at My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep Since I was in grade 4 I have been getting myself X and my mom up in time for school My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up feed the pets Dogs and cats let them out to play make mine and X s lunch for the day make myself breakfast X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up We are out the door by 8 25am As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day Thankfully as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something I still hate being late let the record be known However I have not been in Gen Ed for nearly 3 years now and still have to wake X up My mom thankfully has gotten better however she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession beginning the process of waking him up at 7 30 to give him an extra half hour pulling the blankets off him spraying him with water which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist yelling and using a very loud alarm Nothing works He never wakes up I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5 30am I am so fucking tired I don t even know what to do I don t know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop I don t know how much I can take of this anymore I just want to be a kid and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can t keep doing this",19.0,female,sibling,10-19

text body: I F19 just really got the grasp of how much of a loser my dad 59 is It first started when I was in the 4th grade he moved to the US so I could have a better life I was born and raised in Spain I m mixed with Ecuadorian from mom and Cuban from dad but I moved to the US when I started 7th grade He missed a lot of my crucial moments ages because he was working the whole time yet he doesn t have any money or own anything to his name He always gave me this stupid excuse of how he s been working hard this whole time so I can have a better life yet I don t see any of the money or efforts that he so desperately worked for IDK WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS MONEY BRUH Since I m the youngest out of my 4 siblings all of them are adults I was the only one that moved here to the US along with my mom 57 It put a lot of pressure on me over the years since I m the only one that knows Spanish English fluently I was 12 y o already translating important documents that a kid shouldn t even be doing I always had to translate help for my parents for ANYTHING and there was not a single moment where I actually enjoyed or had the time to enjoy regular teenage girl things because of them and because of that I developed a lot of stress early in my life I don t really blame my mom for anything because she was the one who basically raised me by herself and she didn t want this life or misery my dad is really hard on her My problem really is with my dad he s a man child that doesn t know how to control his emotions talking to him feels so pointless I ve expressed how I feel about him multiple times but it feels like I m talking to a wall He always used to put out his anger on me like I was his emotional toy to use this changed overtime as I grew older because I didn t wanna put up with it anymore but now he s doing the same thing to my mom He always talks about the same things how his arms body hurt and how he s miserable because he s working on a different state and his not with us mind you he works out of state so he only comes home max twice every month for like a week how he barely has any money he owes money to people yet he chooses to have that life He s always talking about the same damn things and it s never anything different he always gets mad when I tell him I don t want to hear any of his miserable bullshit because it doesn t make me feel good at all I ve grown to be very anxious because of him I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells because as soon as something doesn t go his way he starts exploding and he has to make his problems everybody s problems Lately he s been demanding that I start paying rent because the financial situation is tight My cousin from his side recently moved to my house with her husband and son because they immigrated from Cuba to the US and they didn t have anyone to receive them First of all he didn t even consult me or my mom to see if we were fine with them moving to our house he just brought them home without saying anything I don t have anything against them but it s still very annoying Second of all because of them we have been spending more money on the bills and food so now he s demanding that I help pay rent along with my cousin and her husband I wouldn t mind helping if it wasn t for the fact that he gets payed weekly twice more than me but somehow he never has any fucking money I ve been planning on moving out soon with my boyfriend 20 because I can t stand this situation anymore but it s very hard for me to move out considering that I have to give him 400 out of my check I still have leftover money but there s stuff that I also pay on my own so I basically don t really have a lot of money left He always talks about himself and how miserable he is I hate having to even call him because he s always talking about the same shit and as soon as I talk about something regarding myself he somehow manages to switch it up on poor him ALWAYS I m just very frustrated and angry at this point because he s embarrassed me and done said a lot of horrible things to me but he acts like he never did I love my dad very much but I m really starting to resent him as the days go on Every time he comes home the vibe always changes everyone notices his horrible energy so everyone has to walk on eggshells every time he s home I hate when he gets home because he s always complaining about how hard his life is but he never wants to do anything about it he loves complaining to everyone and I m FED UP I really would appreciate any advice or help because I m at the point where I just wanna go in a corner and cry I feel like I can never have a good relationship with him because he s never really been involved with my life and now it s too late I feel very awkward and tense around him I don t even feel like I m his daughter I feel like I m some type of secretary or helper because he s always relying on me for almost everything like he is hopeless if I don t help him He has done a lot more horrible things but this is a basic summary of everything He is hopeless and I m not going to be here for any longer to tolerate his misery My problem now is that I don t know how to control cope with this anxiousness stress and also on how to control the way I feel because as soon as my dad does say something it s like my whole mood changes and I feel shitty I know that the cause is my dad but it feels so hard to control it and I haven t really had any luck with it I ve been coping with smoking but it s been about 3 yrs or so and I m tired of this cycle I feel very lost",19.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: Yeah the title is strange sorry Hi Before I start I d like to say that I love my sister She s the only person I m not kidding in my family that I love But sometimes I HATE her and have a bad relationship with her To give you a bit of background me F 20 and my little sister 19 soon to be 20 in June we re not twins me 2005 her 2006 As kids we were super close really like best friends we cooked together played games watched movies But that all changed when she went back to high school and got a phone and maybe forty at the Covid I live with my relatively toxic mother another story my half sister whom I don t like but another story and my sister My father died in 2022 but I never really appreciated him Basically my relationship with my family is complex but that s not the topic for today Here s a list of behavior in my sister that I find problematic or even concerning She s locked in her room all day talking with her friends or being on tik tok She doesn t take care of her hygiene no shower doesn t take off her make up doesn t brush her teeth keeps her work uniform that smells of restaurant grease But her hygiene problem goes back a long way when she was 7 8 years old She doesn t clean her room her study desk is full with make up products there are cups of bubble tea and starbucks that are several days or even months old there are dirty plates everywhere clothes on the floor a very strong smell from the perfume and her uniform She doesn t understand sharing a common space the shower is overrun with her products BUT SHE DOESN T TAKE A SHOWER I just have three bottles soap shampoo conditioner She doesn t help with the household chores even if I m at college and I don t have the time and my mother is permanently injured work accident She gets angry for no reason my mother or I ask her to clean her room or do the housework I tell her nicely too when we encourage her to study she s in an adult school because she failed high school when we tell her to come home early or not to go out with her friends from Monday to Sunday or when we leave her door ajar just to ventilate her room because it stinks She s disorganized when I ask her to pick me up after school or work she s either an hour late or she s COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN She doesn t do her laundry she s either locked in her room or out with friends In connection with these outings she s bought herself a used car my family and I don t know where she s going with whom and we don t know when she ll be back which is worrying She gets off work or school 3 30 or 4 30 pm and comes home at 1 or 2 am Then she has the AUDACITY to be angry under the pretext of wanting to live her life LIKE GURL STF Sorry As for her car she doesn t take care of it It s dirty it stinks she drives it constantly as if it were new she doesn t want to look to see if everything s OK oil wiper fluid listen to weird noises etc She refuses to make a doctor s appointment She says she doesn t know what to do I didn t know at first either I just googled it She doesn t take care of herself and yet she s anemic but refuses to take a blood test I have to wait until she gets home before going to sleep 1am 2am I have to call her to tell her to come home which is clearly not my role She doesn t understand that there are reasonable times to come home She can be mean and cold to me whereas I m nice to her and I m constantly defending her in arguments with our mother Sometimes she suffers but refuses to talk about it She can be manipulative and it s me who comes across as the victim or slave of the house because I do everything for her and defend her all the time during arguments with the family She only eats junk food Before she destroyed my mother s car which was the ONLY CAR in the house an accident but nothing serious just the bumper which insurance companies say can t be repaired she refused to share it with me For example when she asks me to drop her off at work or school or when I pick her up she wants to drive like I M THE DRIVER I ve since stopped because it s not fair yk I understand that she wants to practice but my sister ALWAYS has the car I only touched that car 10 times before the accident Her driving terrifies me she plays the music so loudly that I can hear it through my sony earbuds wireless WHICH IS NOT NORMAL She drives super fast and zig zags on the freeway because cars drive slowly What s more her seat is positioned at a 120 degree angle HOW DO YOU DO YOUR BLIND SPOTS It takes her forever to pay me back Sometimes she forgets to pay her share of the phone bill we share a family plan together because it s cheaper She s ignorant she knows nothing about basic history or general knowledge of our world I tell her James Crow laws she doesn t know LIKE GIRL YOU ARE BLACK HOW She doesn t know the dates of the first and second world wars LIKE HOW I know she skipped a lot of classes but this is abusive Just to let you know I ABSOLUTELY don t understand who my sister is I don t know if this is normal for a little sister or not She can be nice and all but I think she abuses my kindness patience and generosity Sometimes I wonder if I should cut off all connection with her before I drown and she learns to be an adult I help her but I can t ALWAYS help her Like she has to be independent I know that everything may seem contradictory but this is my situation I just want to know if there are people who are going through something similar or would have any advice Thanks so much for reading and feel free to ask any questions Ps English is not my mother language sorry",20.0,female,sister,20-29

My mother is avoiding me when I come over and visit her.,"title: My mother is avoiding me when I come over and visit her.

text body: Hey all I have recently had a falling out with my mother and it s something that I have been very vigilant and observant about but also bit my tongue on for quite some time Only recently have I lost my cool with her which led to a falling out between her and myself When I come over to see my Mom she works from home in the living room during her working hours within weekdays we are neighbours as I live one second away from her home even when she s not busy and free away from calls and meetings within her working hours which most of the time that s the case for her so she s chilling anyway she either invites me in into her house or I will ring on her door to see if she s alright and just check in really and instead of being an active listener and showing interest in our conversation she immediately walks away and starts cleaning hoovering doing something without showing her face but of course she continues to drag the conversation by shouting over the rooms in her house as that s her way of communicating directly at me that she is willing to listen She then proceeds to go into the kitchen and I have to raise my voice so she can hear me In all honesty it sounds a bit daft but it feels like I am speaking to her ghost or the wall Not very respectful I think And this is something that doesn t just happen with me but also with my grandmother since she and I share our home and she also deals with a similar situation My mother and I can t speak on her behalf seems to be always busy and always on the go but it can get out of hand especially when you want to chill out with her and spend some quality family time even when it s already been planned and is happening in the moment My mother was also very absent when I was born she was extremely busy and away from the country due to her work demands and responsibilities My father got up and went to the store to get some milk ygm and raising me was left to my grandparents my mother s parents So again my mother was out of the picture for some time She was only there temporarily like blips in my memory banks and then she d go elsewhere One example here is I took my Mom out for a coffee in a nice fancy 5 star hotel restaurant a few months back Within about sitting for roughly 15 minutes or so my mother goes to me Drink up we have to get going and I look at my watch and tell her What s the rush Have you got to be someplace somewhere now and she reponds No and goes silent I have tried to tell her she has got to switch off because it seems like she s in a constant rush 24 7 and then struggles to deal with stress management and her stuff I guess that s how her mind works and each to their own but it feels sometimes very cold to just get to know her on a deeper level and spend some time with her mother to son I m 23 and she s 45 so she s relatively a young mother but even then when she isn t working or doing something that s in her diary schedule or agenda for the day she seems to be always caught up in something or be aggressively interested in tackling another task out of thin air which hasn t been spoken about for instance she s extremely impulsive with decision making on the spot and each decision is always met with this whooosh of aggression and IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW kind of attitude if you get me She likes to be hard working even when the time isn t there but it s hard to socialize and bond with her My late grandfather my mom s father when he was alive also had a very similar mindset and attitude as my mother only he was more rational and sensible sometimes I know my grandfather spent a lot of time with my mom whilst she was growing up which might have had an impact on her personality in her later years since he raised her more as a son than a daughter and maybe this is my mothers internal everlasting grievance towards him by her adapting her personality and attitude in life to him she even tells me and my grandmother when she does things for example it s what he d do like trying to be a reincarnation or second version of him or something which further escalates into situations like these where my mother isn t being very motherly and it s very hard to bond and spend time with her Anyway so a couple of days ago I had a small crashout of sorts by acting the same way and mirroring her behavior back towards her when she came over to my house this time to see my grandmother and she then had a go at me and started asking me What s wrong where I simply said I m just acting and behaving the way you do because I ve had enough and I walked away She of course was taken back by this and retaliated by talking to herself and she walked off and left the house That was the last time we spoke Apologies for this long winded story but I just don t know what I should do Am I being the A hole here or is she in the wrong Do I reach out to her first and apologize or do I wait for her to come around and sit down with me Who reaches out first to whom and breaks the ice",23.0,male,son,20-29

text body: Hi I 21F have been bullied and treated poorly my whole life by my family I am the eldest child of 2 me 21F and sister 19F As a child I used to want to be friends with 19F and in all the pictures you could see it I would cuddle her and try and play with her hair and I would try and just love her eventually over time we started becoming disconnected she always wanted to be with our mum and it used to be that our dad was a very tough and strong man he was strict and taught us everything we know but we used to fear him because of that My sister when she was at home with dad and I she would be in the other room or on her device where as I used to want to watch movies with him and wanted to understand him as time went on I can see now I probably tried to hard I always wanted to be the best child I could be and I can honestly say that I tried so hard At home when I was around 11 and my sister was 9 that s when things started changing my parents would call me a liar all the time and I would rarely lie and my mum would send me to my aunts because in her words I can t deal with her but my sister would stay at home When I was supposed to go on excursions for school they would do small things like not letting me have money but letting her have money or sometimes I just wasn t allowed to go As we got into high school I distanced myself from my family I got social media and I started making friends but I was never allowed to go to party s so people slowly stopped inviting me I started to become depressed as I watched my sister go to boy girl party s and sleepovers and my parents would always tell me it s because I never got invited 1 day when I did get invited I had to take the blame for a friend for a friend when she got in trouble with a teacher and my parents stopped me from going When I met my now husband things got worse I was told that he was bad for me and that they didn t like him because he ate too much chocolate and random excuses and soon after that is when I started distancing myself even more I would spend nights at my husbands mums house when we were 17 As the years went on my parents hated that I wasn t there anymore so they offered to let me live on a granny flat on their property but that was the worst thing for me My dad made a contract that had rules for my living there I wasn t allowed my husband over at all I had to be at the house 5 nights a week I couldn t have any visitors day at the granny flat I didn t have a washing machine so I had to wait for them to be there to do it and if they went away I couldn t wash my clothes Failure to do any of these things would end up with me getting kicked out This is when I realised how controlling they were my sister meanwhile drove 2 3 hours to meet some guy who she ended up dating during this time she would never be home she would not listen to anyone but mum and dad didn t care The rules for me and the roles for her were completely different My mum and dad then wanted to open a business and offered it to my sister and he boyfriend I begged them to give me a chance and instead after about 6 months in the house they kicked me out so that my sister and her new boyfriend could move in I was sick at the time and I asked them to wait because I couldn t do it they then changed the locks through my stuff into rubbish bags and locked it in their garage saying I need to get it off them and that I am disowned because they didn t want me I got my things and left and moved in with my nana and my husband for about 6 months on and off Then as we were visiting my grandfather my mum called saying my dad passed away my husband and I drove 3 4 hours at night down to my mum my mums whole family was there and they controlled everything they didn t let my husband in with me they made me leave after a period and I had nothing to do with the funeral I also found out a bunch of dads old friends didn t even get invited to the funeral because mum didn t want to I agreed to try and help mum during this time by cleaning and doing what I can and no sooner then I arrived I got kicked out because 1 day my sister had a panic attack because I moved her washing basket into her room while I was cleaning the bathroom She ended up scratching up my arm screaming at me spitting at me and she pushed me and then as she was about get in my face I pushed her down onto her bed and told her to stop and calm down she then ran out of the house and cried hysterically in her car somewhere when I called mum it was immediately my fault and I should never have done the cleaning and I should never have spoken to her even though I was asked to clean and try and fix things with her Mum kicked me out the next week saying that I was causing too many problems I then asked her if she had noticed how this is a form of attention seeking manipulation and she told me to stop lying to make my sister seem bad and things were never like this when I was gone and I need to go I left and I haven t spoken to mum since in person and I moved away with my husband mum still screams at me over text and gets angry at me over text but I don t know what to do I ve spoken to some of dads old friends who mum was rude to and they told me they noticed the favouring of my sister over me I m honestly just exhausted Please offer any advice it would be great",21.0,female,eldest child,20-29

text body: My husband and I 32M 28F had our first baby in February Life has been great and we receive a lot of help from my parents they watch baby at our house twice a week My whole family has met baby but unfortunately my husband s family lives across the country My husband was showing signs of sadness due to them not meeting our baby yet It pains me to see him upset he thinks he hides it well so I planned on getting his mother to come visit His family doesn t have much money so I paid for her plane ticket and decided to surprise him with her He was so happy and thanked me profusely for hours That night he sat down with me and said remember my mom has a lot of strong opinions I m worried she might offend you while she s here I assured him this is a happy time and I will keep my guard up For some context his mother and I get along because I m a people pleaser and tend to shy away from confrontation I will say if I met her on the street I probably would walk away from her She is an overly negative person which I understand because I lived a few years of my life like that but it can be overwhelming at times She has insulted my looks before immediately after I ran a marathon asking if I ever heard of a hairbrush and if I planned on putting makeup on I also heard she calls me Silver spoon It is day 2 of her 2 week stay My husband went to work and I m watching baby You need to stop picking him up You re going to regret it Let him cry he s not going to die Just put some music on to drown out the noise Stop picking him up all the time This baby is so spoiled All day I listened to these comments but I held my tongue and kept tending to my baby Keep in mind my baby doesn t really cry I pick him up before he gets to that point At one point she was holding him and smushed his foot between a metal bar stool and her hip He immediately started pain crying I smiled and said oh no you re alright little man and took him from her He s fine He doesn t need you to help him all the time He stopped crying and his foot was fine A while later she said I can t believe he smiles so much He s such a happy baby Do you think something is wrong with him I replied he s happy because we listen to his communication and tend to his needs She didn t respond My mom came over to help watch him while I got some sleep And then it happened I was getting ready for bed when I heard baby crying I always check on him even if he s in the care of someone else It s as if his crying is calling my name and it s instinctual I knew he was overtired and ready for a nap MIL was holding baby while my mom cleaned some bottles I walk over to baby to grab him MIL NO She turns him away from me He s fine Go to bed Me I can t sle MIL yells over me GO TO BED Me I physically can t sleep if I hear him crying please give me my baby She turns him away from me again and I had the urge to rip him away from her and snap I wanted to scream to never withhold my own baby from me But I held my tongue and explained calmly that he s tired and I know how to get him to sleep in less than a minute I then grabbed baby while she gripped onto him tighter MIL LEAVE HIM ALONE He doesn t need you My mom stepped in give her the baby and watch how fast she can make him sleep it s so crazy We need her to teach us She reluctantly handed me baby and I got him to sleep in about a minute I laid him down and went upstairs I didn t tell my husband what happened but my mom came to check on me I expressed how angry it made me and that it s only for 2 weeks My mom said I ll spend more time here the next two weeks to help out I don t trust her alone with him So now I m here There s more things I could add but this is already long She told me all her children including my husband would tremble rip their own hair out and scream for hours She said she would hit them when they cried for too long and they would eventually stop She also said she smoked her whole pregnancy and that they showed signs of withdrawal when born tremors and excessive crying My husband has talked about how they were raised and that he will never raise our children that way but he still loves his mom I m just lost I was only looking at the positives when planning her visit but now that she s here I can only see the negatives How do I make it through these next 2 weeks without snapping How do I find the patience to handle the comments Am I being overprotective Any advice welcome",28.0,female,mother,20-29
I think me and my husband are cursed,"title: I think me and my husband are cursed
author: DragonsBoy
text body: I m 22 f and my husband is a 24 m No I don t actually think we re cursed but it feels like it We got married April 26th and ever since we got married things have never gone right only wrong Not even two days after we got married my sister got into a huge argument with me my husband and my mother She was yelling at us and obviously me and my mother had no problem yelling back at her and because my husband simply raised his voice at my sister trying to defend me and my mother and it wasn t anything offensive towards her he just wanted us to stop fighting At the moment he was holding our two year old son in his left arm and all because he said something my sister went for him and physically tried to assault him while he held our son He grabbed her right wrist with his right hand and because there was a gate between them she used her left arm to try and lift herself up on the gate and the metal on top of the gate dug into her arm he never even touched her left arm because he was using his right hand to hold her right wrist and using his left arm to hold our son Thankfully she wasn t able to hit my husband or son but I did immediately yank her away from him and she turned on me and got me down on the ground before she started to punch me in the head while having a hold of my hair I tried to get her off but she s a lot bigger than me my mom tried to get her off of me but accidentally lost her flip flop in the process when she got my sister off my sister grabbed my mom s shoe that had fallen off and hit me with it in the face My mom got us separated and she was told to leave immediately The next day we did call the cops my mom had told me not to the night before because she didn t want anymore problems but I told her the next day that she needed consequences for her actions because this wasn t the first time my sister has lashed out at a family member and physically attacked someone because she lost her temper And my son could ve been hit because of her actions so that s the biggest reason I wanted to press charges and make a report We called the cops made the report and pressed charges She was arrested that same evening And don t worry it gets worse After she got arrested her boyfriend started texting my mom harassing her about how this was all her fault and she should ve never let me call the cops that because of her my sister was having to sit in jail right now And the very next day my sister wasn t even in there for a full 24 hours my grandmother bailed her out My grandmother says she isn t taking sides but she s been nothing but supportive of my sister and her crazy ass boyfriend I didn t drive anywhere the day after she got arrested but two days after she was arrested I had to go to town to run some errands and my car wouldn t start The engine wouldn t turn over but the battery life was still working even when I could get my car to start for a few seconds the engine would shake violently I called my grandfather and he came over to look at my car because the same thing was happening with my husbands car shaking engine and wouldn t hardly start We noticed that when we took the gas caps off my car and my husbands that there was a dark brown liquid around the rim there was an excessive amount We immediately began to think that my sister s boyfriend did something because this was just too much of a coinsidence that BOTH of our cars stopped working at the same time and he had already lashed out at my mom so he was clearly angry with us all for what we did My grandfather tasted the liquid around the gas caps and low and behold it was COCA COLA I tasted it myself and I felt like I was going to explode because it tasted exactly like coke and our cars were having the exact symptoms if someone were to pour coke into our fuel tanks And after my sister had been arrested her boyfriend was the only person who had actually been alone that night and lived right down the road at my grandmother s house all he had to do was walk through the patch of woods through my neighbors yard and then he d be at our house My grandmother claims that he was at his aunts house the night my sister got arrested but he could easily be lying and can t show any proof that he was actually there But also Nobody knows what time he could ve gotten there he could ve went over there for a little bit or went over there late a night after he was done tampering with our cars Sadly we don t have any cameras put up so we don t have any physical evidence to prove that it was him my husband and I live with my mom so her brand spanking new car was in the driveway same as ours And hers never got touched so we know it wasn t some teenager or else they would ve hit all three cars And nobody else in our neighborhood got touched so who else could it be Of course they re swearing up and down he didn t do it but my sister is also claiming that my husband attacked her and tried to break her arm over the gate when he had a hold of her and that she had only been pointing at him She had never tried to hit him even though we all witnessed her fist going up in the air like she was going to haymaker him So I guess we were all just imagining things Maybe she was pointing her fist up at the sky But also if my husband was the one attacking her why would I not go after him Why would I need to yank her off of him if he was the one doing the attacking And if she was hurt and scared just as much as she acts like she was why would her first response be to turn on me and start pummeling me and beating me with a freaking shoe I could ve just been trying to help her We all know she s full of it just like her boyfriend is But because neither me or my husband have a working car because the coke has completely screwed up our cars even after we tried putting Heet into the fuel tanks It s been extremely stressful between us his job has barely been giving him any hours so we barely have any income coming in and I mean like not even 100 a week kind of income Since we got married we haven t had a single night or even day to ourselves we never went on a honeymoon because we couldn t afford it and we were just gonna try and go later when we had more money We ve been fighting constantly it feels like I feel like we make each other miserable and that he doesn t want to be with me because I m hard to be around right now same for him it s been hard to deal with him because he doesn t have a stable job we have three kids to take care of he won t talk to me about his feelings We just argue and argue I don t think we ve really had a single day since we got married where we didn t argue or get into it about something And then on top of all of this my ex my two oldest sons biological father has been nothing but a dick and is threatening to get an attorney to get the kids from me even though he s the literal definition of a deadbeat the kids don t even know him really he sees them maybe once a year and doesn t ever call them He doesn t provide for them and he refuses to fill out any child support paperwork that the child support office sends him so clearly he s talking out of his ass But it s another stressful thing to add to the pile I try to focus on the good like our wonderful adorable kids but a lot of the time I just want to cry and fall apart I feel like me and my husband are going to get worse and our kids don t need to see us fighting but they do I m afraid I m losing my husband and our relationship is extremely strained right now I don t know what to do I try to be in a good mood for my kids and him but there s always something that gets to me and then ruins the day for me I have major depression disorder and borderline personality disorder along with very bad anxiety I ve tried to research what I can do to do better but something ever seems to help I ve tried therapy in the past but they don t ever seem to listen or they tell me things that I already know The last therapist said that I m a chaos seeker and I told her that at times yes I can be because that s what I ve grown up it s been nothing but drama with me and my family or me and my ex and his family at this point I don t know anything but toxic relationships and cycles I don t want that with my husband though we ve been together for four years and he truly has been the most supportive guy I ve ever met he s become a dad to my two oldest boys and we have a wonderful little boy together as well I m just scared that I m going to lose them and don t really know what to do",22.0,female,wife,20-29

text body: Hello everyone I need some unbiased advice Before my husband 40m and I 34f became serious we both made some mistakes However being a woman from the Caribbean I feel like I m judged more harshly We ve been married for three years now and for the most part we are happy together There haven t been any issues on my end or his to my knowledge I try to be a good housewife I don t go out often because he gets jealous and I prefer to avoid arguments by listening to him The problem is that my family is planning a reunion on a six day cruise and he initially agreed to go and pay his share He has a green card no criminal background but he is terrified to leave the country and now says that my kids and I can t go I might be in the wrong because I paid the remaining balance for the cruise even though he later said no since the deposit was non refundable I was hoping he would change his mind as I would be losing 1 000 something he wasn t willing to pay back Now I ve paid the full cost of the cruise which is 3 000 and he hasn t changed his mind about going The trip is in 50 days and I m really eager to go We spent the weekend with my cousins and my male cousins advised me not to go saying it would ruin my marriage Meanwhile my female cousins think it s unfair for me not to attend since I ll be surrounded by family What do you all think My husband has added that if I go I can t complain if he decides to take a vacation by himself",34.0,female,wife,30-39

text body: Disclaimer i know this is long scroll to TLDR to skip backstory My older half sister is 33 and still lives with our parents Me 20 F still also live with my parents However she s 33 with a full time job and my parents by this i mean 100 my mom don t ask her to pay a DIME no rent no bills NOTHING The only thing she does is work I am a full time student in nursing school with 2 part time jobs I have busted my ass to get scholarships and get loan forgiveness through my school in return to work for them after graduation All because I never wanted my parents to stress about adding another bill like my school tuition I ve been a full time college student straight out of high school and they have never had to pay a penny for my tuition And yet she says she has no money and is broke all the time to my parents and us My mom has even given her money when she says she is going out with her now ex boyfriend That makes me incredibly angry she takes advantage of my mom s pitty for her and shields her from the rest of us who see things how they are Now this is not the only reason I heavily dislike my older sister just because i don t want to use hate but now i think i do for a lot of reasons I met her when i was 8 when she came from mexico after my grandma passed who she lived with and at first it was great and so cool to have an older sister that soon faded like very quickly She would just straight up bully me and try to discipline me when my parents weren t home and she was supposed to watch me like hit me and slap me when they weren t home and not in a playful way I never said anything because i didn t want to cause problems and i was just a quiet shy kid all around At the time we had a family friend who lived in an extra room and he witnessed her slap me and was the one who alerted my parents When confronted she got out of it saying she just wanted to go back to Mexico because she wasn t welcomed here In which my mom just begged her to stay Since then she s always been bitter and purposely doing things to me in which i grew to really not speak to her or interact with her i ve only really stuck up for myself a few times when she was being out loud and direct but most of the time she just does things to get a reaction out of me My mom always complains how she hates that we don t get along and says I just don t like her We ve talked plenty of times and her response is you just have to understand she was raised by my mom and i think she just wants to be more like you and the life you had remember her dad never spoke to her and it s just a lot in which I always say im not going to going to feel pitty for her and excuse her behavior because of it My mom hates it because she says we only have each other here and she doesn t know what will happen when she dies On a separate occasion she has told my younger sister full sister 13 when speaking about me that she resents me because my mom left her and came to a different country when she was 12 and then got pregnant with me Now it s not like I had the best childhood ever in fact it was far from good because my parents worked day and night and i spent most of my time with a babysitter who would discipline kids physically As well as having to immediately kill my childhood when my mom left for her took her 7 months to come back because my little sister was 1 year old and my dad couldn t handle us both so I learned how to take care of her from showering changing diapers feeding everything while we weren t with our babysitter But they worked so much because my mom would send so much money to my grandma for her She was put on a pedestal by my grandma and spoiled so i m confused at how she resents me when i didn t do anything but just live i guess Here s where my absolute hatred begins I ve been gay for a long time since I was in middle school and she never really said anything about it I ve been dating my gf for over 2 years and everything was fine she just said hi or casual conversation Theres been some recent incidents where she had taken her keys and gone out in someone else s car and block in my gf to where she couldn t leave and her excuse being i thought she was spending the night she left at 8pm with her car keys even though she wasn t taking her car and my gf only spends the night on holidays where she will drink something so that was just bizarre weird behavior On top of other petty incidents we like to think she s just weird and jealous for example I like hello kitty i have a lot do hello kitty things and my gf buys me a lot of hello kitty things for the last few years my hello kitty collection has grown and then a few months ago out of no where she added a hello kitty bumper sticker to her car and some to her bare stanley i thought oh okay weird but whatever she s been on and off with a man for about 2 years and he genuinely does not like her it s very obvious but that s a different story Last week she claims they broke up indefinitely this time so she apparently has way too much time on her hands TLDR She doesn t go out with any friends or anything of the sorts and i can see why but yesterday we were invited to a wedding in which my mom told me to bring my gf my younger sister who also doesn t really like her because of her weird activity and me and her are very close Before leaving my mom says oh we re gonna need 2 cars because we won t all fit I just said okay i ll drive my car and drive us Since i m not close enough my older sister says ooh alicia s my gf just gonna drive herself in which i m like um no she s not i just said i m driving us she didn t say anything and just walked to the car My little sister saw my irritation and got in the car with me and my gf everything was fine after until it wasn t At the party i sat on the same side of the table as her but with a empty chair in between my gf sister and i just being dumb and bored were making random jokes about nothing in particular and just laughing nothing very sneaky or suspicious just talking I think nothing of this me and my gf get up to throw our food plates away and see if we want any dessert on our way back to our table i notice her taking a video of us not very secretly playing it off like she s on her phone I thought maybe I was just paranoid or something when i go to sit and i glance and she s just sitting on facebook and puts her phone down I continue doing my thing about 15 minutes later i notice her trying to turn her phone screen while texting which makes me think she doesn t want me to see so i just look away until i catch something that looks familiar out of the corner of my eye She s on whatsapp texting someone and sending pictures of me and my gf standing and talking followed by a video of us walking towards the table I play closer attention and she opens her gallery to attach more and more pictures of us pop up I m trying to get a better look but am too far to see what she s saying I can only see a few chat logs in response with laughing emojis and text I immediately am filled with rage and i look over to my gf to tell her she s like weird bitch oh my god what s her problem my little sister notices my face and asks what happened my gf tells her and she looks confused and mostly in disbelief i tell her to come sit next to me to get a better look so she comes and sits in between us i play it off saying the light is in her eye when she moves because my mom asks Older sister is still oblivious and continues to text my little sister then text me I can t understand what she s saying because it s in spanish she s not a great spanish reader but it says something about being gay This just makes it worse and in the moment i want to grab her and drag her outside My gf tried to calm me down and i can just feel my body heat raising so i try to calm down because i know she s not worth it i text my dad who also dislikes her because of how she acts and my mom babying her and tell him she took pics and vids of us and is sending them to someone he tells me to tell my mom so i text her as well we re all at the same table im very visibly angry and upset i watch her read it and got upset a few minutes later she tells her go outside with her I begin to talk to them about it when they leave including my dad and he just agrees with me I m very angry and i think she s genuinely a bitter ugly jealous person and needs to pick a struggle I start making jokes about how if she really wanted a picture of us that bad she could ve just asked us and we could ve posed or done something else just to calm me down from knocking her teeth out outside About 7 minutes go by and they come back and there chatting like normal I spend the rest of the night not looking at her or ignoring her which was already what i was doing but I know this will be talked about when my mom realizes i won t be speaking to her anymore under any circumstances",20.0,female,sister,20-29

text body: Disclaimer I have horrible memory Some information may be missing in the descriptions of what happened because I simply don t remember which might make the situation sound a bit weird Also lowkey long post Hello Before I explain the situation I want to explain my family dynamic just a little bit I also apologize if anything is explained weirdly if I begin rambling or over explaining I m just trying to not miss out on any details that might be helpful I 16 F am the oldest child of a family with three children My bio siblings are 14 F and freshly 13 F I used to have a very strained relationship with both of my parents especially when puberty first hit and around the time I was diagnosed with depressive episodes but we re mostly neutral getting better now My relationship with my bio siblings is hard to describe it changes up a lot of the time This post is about my youngest bio sibling the freshly 13 y o who we ll call Alex As background on Alex they were an early bloomer in things of puberty and they atleast used to I don t know if they still do look up to me a lot and copy a lot of the things I do I m assuming this lead them to think they re mature for their age and should be allowed the things I am allowed even though they quite literally were 12 up until a few days ago My parents share this assumption Example for this is hair dye I began dyeing my hair when I was 13 almost 14 I dyed it red with Henna and kept that and black until I was 15 that is when I began using bleach and doing more funky colors Alex began using bleach at 12 even after my mother said multiple times that she doesn t even like me using bleach she doesn t want a 12 y o to bleach their hair They have a tendency to just disappear from home for hours without telling anyone where they re going and then returning at past 10PM or just not keeping to set return times in general one time we called the police to report them as missing because they didn t come back after having supposedly gone to training only for them to show up at nearly 11PM on a weekday after having skipped training to go to a queer meet up at a local bar My parents always get very frustrated when things like that happen or when they steal money or break any other rule because they don t know what to do Because how do you show a 12 year old that their actions have consequences They already barely have their phone tablet because of their many f ups because that s the only thing my parents can actually enforce If they grounded Alex they d just not come home directly after school and they also don t actually want to ground anyone Besides Alex has a massive screentime problem anytime they don t have their phone they go running around desperately to find something they can go online with I ve seen them open Instagram over out TV or the laptop we use for school work One time they brought a school ipad home and spent the entire night on it and when my mother found out and told them to give it back they didn t and instead hid it outside and then got it once my mother thought they d given it back Now what actually made me write about all this is something that happened this evening after dinner My parents sat us down to talk about screentime and the topic of Alex s screentime came up again My parents criticized them for being on their phone so much and letting it distract them from schoolwork which is causing them to possibly not even get into the next grade There was a fight I don t remember about what exactly most likely about limiting Alex s screentime more While my father and they were discussing that my mother had gone upstairs to get me pain meds I had asked for them because of period cramps My mother keeps the pain meds in the same place as our lunch money and when she came back downstairs she was pissed because someone had stolen nearly half of next week s lunch money Alex is the only possible suspect my father has no reason to take our lunch money and would ve said something my other bio sibling earns her money by doing small tasks for our mother and is just the golden child who would never do that in general and I don t even know where the money and meds are kept and I also have enough money of my own so Alex is the only possible person who could have taken it They absolutely snapped when my mother confronted them and got up to run upstairs while screaming and crying My mother was standing in the doorway they had to take and when she tried talking to them when they passed They punched her My mother is shocked at them using violence against her and my jaw actually just dropped when I saw that I want to make clear that my parents are not physically abusive before anyone starts that theory They re not the greatest emotionally and have said questionable things but other than rare play fights there has never been physically violence in our house I don t know where this came from and I don t know how to handle it or how to handle Alex in general I know that I m not their mother and I shouldn t concern myself with that too much but I still do and I know that it might be puberty but puberty isn t a reason for physically assaulting a parent What do you do with a kid who does that Where did that even come from To everyone who read until here thank you so much I m so sorry if anything was unclear I ll answer any questions that come up as good as I can Have a good day night whatever",16.0,female,sibling,10-19

understand why She eventually told my sister 20F i ll refer to her as Y that my dad had told her K not to tell anyone about when they were playing around my sister Y then about 13 didn t know what to do so she went and told me i asked her K what happened K said they were playing around and he was tickling her and then he kissed her but later told her not to tell anyone and it freaked her out K said it was simply a peck and it only happened that once my dad has always been an affectionate person and a small peck was normal as a child but it had always been innocent affection obviously it didn t continue after we got older we all got together as a family and talked about this my dad said the reason he said to not say anything was because he noticed K s reaction was starting to become more of something stimulating to her so he stopped and didn t want to make it embarrassing to K he didn t think too much of what he said as time went by everything was back to normal K and my dad s relationship looked unaffected though the possibility of that happening was always at the back of my mind from that point on and it really affected me he never gave me a reason to think he did it on purpose before or after the incident it made more sense it was miscommunication as my K got older she started to be more secretive and never spoke to us about her thoughts friends or school eventually we got a call from her high school that she got expelled after being caught vaping in the classroom that was something unbelievable to us Y and i were always calm and responsible getting anything lower than a B was disappointing to us let alone expelled K was grounded and expelled for a week K brought up the incident again saying that what my dad did to her affected her we spoke about it again and it seemed like we reached the same conclusion as before he apologized and said he never meant for something like that to happen and make her feel like he was doing harm to her K returned back to school but it made us question who she truly was eventually through mutuals Y was told that K had a boyfriend we assumed K was embarrassed to tell us since Y and i never had a relationship before so we just kept quiet and waited until K felt comfortable enough to tell us as K s punishment for not doing well in school my mom took away her phone on there was conversations with her boyfriend an entire different person was in her phone and school in her gallery we found nudes both of K and her boyfriend that they would send each other there was conversation to her friends about them K and her bf skipping school and having sexual interactions in our family car she drove herself to school in it wasn t having a boyfriend that we were worried about but rather how she was going about it my parents were never strict with us in that aspect either Y and i never were in relationships as a personal choice however K being secretive about it sharing what is essentially child pornography skipping school to goes god knows were was what was wrong they thought it was best to pull K out of school and do it online her phone was taken away at first but eventually it was given back in short periods of time once again after looking through her phone we saw K was texting her boyfriend honestly didn t really mind much since it was expected however it was disappointing since we offered her to meet with him in a public setting as couples her age should be doing but she refused and just kept contacting him secretly again in those messages her boyfriend said that he was mad that she is dealing with your moms emotional decisions meaning that K s punishment was simply do to my mom being emotional essentially saying she K did no wrong in that same conversation K said she will try to do something about my parents allowing her to go back to school the last week before summer break later that day she was crying and when asked what was wrong she would say nothing K spent the entire next day in bed sleeping and crying eventually my mom got sick of her acting that way since it felt like it was a tantrum to let her go back to school and in that confrontation she brought back the incident with my dad saying it has affected her and that her friends and boyfriend are the only ones to make her happy she continued to say that she never opened up to my sister Y my mom and i was because we didn t believe her when my dad did that to her in that i told K we did that s why we spoke as a family and confronted him about it at first and it was settled as a misunderstanding then K goes on and says that he actually would put his knee between her legs and rock her back and forth he would also make out with her and that it wasn t only once but it went on for a month before she told us my heart dropped this was entirely different than what she had told us first and it would change the entire event i told this to my dad and as i was observing his reaction to see if it was true it looked like his eyes looked hurt rather than panic he maintained his story on it and said that he never did anything to her other than innocent playing K then went that s all i needed to hear and stormed off when i asked her what she meant by that K said he kept saying it was innocent when it wasn t that i was ten and he knew better and K wanted him to admit that he SAed her basically my dad said he wanted to go back and avoid that entire situation from ever happening and even told her that if she truly felt that he had hurt her to call the cops on him and he would gladly go he just didn t want to see her suffering anymore because of him when she denied doing so he even offered moving out but again declined we offered her a therapist and she hesitantly agreed this entirely changed our family forever the father i know and grew up with would rather die than hurt us he never once made me doubt his intentions toward us or anyone he had always been an anxious man that couldn t lie for his life because his anxious tics would give him away his heart has always been pure and loving my other sister agreed as well so him doing this to her was something my mind couldn t fathom i ve heard stories of families not being there for their children that were SAed and to protect the family essentially denied it happening i didn t want to do that to her my mom said that although she loves my father she will always love her children more my father said the same and understood if we wanted to believe K entirely i don t know what to think i don t deny this affecting my sister but at the same time i feel like i know her less than my dad had Y been the one to say this id have no doubt but K makes me question things why did her story change okay sure maybe she was scared or didn t realize to mention it yet why does she coincidentally bring this up when she s in trouble maybe her emotions are heightened and her emotions spill out why would she ever lie about something this serious is she willing to make this up for her benefit i m not so sure i don t know what to do or what to believe",23.0,female,sister,20-29

text body: So I ll try to explain this as briefly as possible My mom grew up believing never to talk to guys once you get to 6th grade Her sisters told this to her and she passed on such beliefs onto me I was told not to make any friends I was told not to talk to anyone in school unless you need something from them I used to be childish and joke around with my relatives and this made her furious She used to lecture me that I shouldn t laugh and joke around with people and just answer what they ask Nothing else Then i went to middle school and I was told not to talk to guys as every Indian mom does She then told me that I was an unwanted child and she and my dad were planning to send me off to my aunt after I was born This was not a joke I asked this to my relatives till I was 18 and they confirmed this every time At this point I started forming unhealthy friendships and crushes with people which kept on happening till I was almost 20 Apart from this a lot of thing weren t that different Then i went to high school and things started getting worse here Apart from the study pressure I started feeling very low I was never happy I was always in a tough spot I didn t have any good friends This is when my dad passed away and she and my brother became a team He used to beat me up and she used to provoke him There was never an instance when she thought I was in the right My brother dislocated my gums due to which I needed teeth treatment for over a year Yes she never felt sympathy for me and she still thinks I deserved that What did I do I just said no to helping her in cooking in a slightly irritated tone That s it Then comes college I made the worst possible friends here I couldn t even know who is what Other friends of mine actually knew what s right and wrong and I literally couldn t know shit about people who I considered friends Yes I still made unhealthy bonds with people here This is where she started slut shaming me saying that I could sell myself to any guy she loves victim blaming every person on the internet She started looking at girls and getting obsessed with it She never asked about anything in my life other than my female classmates How many girls are in your project group how many girls are in your company how many girls are in your class Etc never asked about people in general just girls She keeps judging every girl for what she wears and gets disappointed in any of my female friends have a boyfriend Not very surprising but I don t have a boyfriend Now she keeps on repeating things like you have to be safe if you live far away you ll get kidnapped if you trust guys you ll get graped never ever fall in love or get in a relationship So am I the bad apple here or is there something wrong with my mother If so what do you think is the psychology behind how she thinks",20.0,female,daughter,20-29
My sister has ruined my pregnancy by being vindictive & self righteous - warning: long story,"title: My sister has ruined my pregnancy by being vindictive & self righteous - warning: long story
author: Royal_Juice2987
text body: Warning very long story and I don t have the energy to summarise after writing it all out but any advice appreciated if you can be bothered reading Thanks I 34F am currently 35 weeks pregnant May 25 This is my first baby and I am pregnant with a baby girl My sister 31 has been my closest friend my entire life but we are completely different personalities As a child I was very outgoing and confident whereas as an adult I suffer with generalised anxiety and have had some low levels of depression on and off throughout my adult life I am an empath and think and feel quite deeply My sister was very shy as a child but has grown up to be a little more outgoing although I don t think she is as emotionally deep as me she has never experienced anxiety and almost dismisses mental health problems generally I d say she thinks that good mental health is a choice and can be controlled easily For reference we have a narcissistic mother a passive emotionally avoidant father and there has been lots of dysfunction in our family and triangulation from my mother in the past I think it s fair to say we have both picked up some horrendous communication habits from our parents We have never been taught good communication or healthy resolution Admittedly I am emotional and see red quite quickly often saying things that whilst are very real to me and 100 relate to what I am feeling and experiencing aren t always helpful My sister on the other hand avoids conflict but is also extremely snappy sulky stroppy and can be very vindictive If you cross her at all she storms off in a bad mood and can give you the silent treatment for as long as she feels fit and it seems she feels absolutely nothing My sister was pregnant a couple of years ago and I had to be at her beck and call every single day to listen to her pregnancy woes and I was always on the other end of the phone to cheer her up on a bad day This continued into my niece arriving I have been obsessed with her ever since feel deep deep love for her and have spent a lot of time with her since she was born Back in February sort of mid late second trimester my sister carefully broke it to me that she was looking to book a holiday around my due date I was gutted she is the only family I really have My mother is so toxic I can t bear her being near me She emotionally abused me for years and I can t stand the thought of her near me or my daughter and my dad never even said congratulations to me because he s too wrapped up in my mums commands This has been a theme throughout his entire relationship with her he s isolated from his own family he has no friends has even seen off his business partner and he acts like he doesn t even have a brain of his own anymore My sister was trying to sell going away to me as leaving me in my bubble This felt weird because her birth was very adverse emergency c section and a stay in hospital with her little girl to which I responded to her every whim to make sure she was cared for Running extra clothes and snacks to the hospital all the while not being allowed in to see her or the baby which was fine and running out to buy some preemie clothing for the baby when she came home as she was so small nothing fit My anxiety took me straight to a place where I would need a family member in a similar capacity and she wouldn t even be in the country I know you can t control people s lives but this stings because I would never book a trip within a month of her due date I care too much and this wouldn t even be a worry she would have to think about I left it a couple of days and felt stressed My partner told me to speak to her I approached it very gently but it quickly turned sour She s a SAHM and her husband pays for them both to live earns an extremely good salary and they are very very well off financially She played the card ask him because he s not willing to pay hundreds of pounds more to go away weeks after because it s school holidays and it gets expensive This pissed me off because 2 years ago she coughed up over 1000 just to go on a hen do for one of her friends his money their money and he wasn t even going I didn t say this to her but I feel like her husband digs his heels in when it s anything to do with her family because he only prioritises his own and they re always seemingly in competition with who s family gets more time with them and their child etc which I find very weird I did tell her that this was tight fisted and that I didn t feel a few hundred pounds warranted missing the birth of your first niece no other kids in the family apart from hers and to not be around for me post partum for a short while I say this knowing I 100 did this for her and if anything it felt like an honour Prior to these messages when she was trying to sell to me being in my bubble as in her not being here in my way she recited a conversation between her and her husband where they d been discussing my due date and how she couldn t possibly miss the birth and she said to her husband I know my sister she s not having a very nice pregnancy and she won t go overdue she will just go to the hospital and get induced I didn t say anything at the time but this really upset me because induction is the last thing I d ever want and I ve expressed this before but seemingly doesn t listen and just wanted to make sure my pregnancy fit in with her plans of a summer holiday abroad I m getting annoyed just reliving all of this right now to be honest Anyway moving on she snapped on the texts and said oh fuck off I won t be there at all at this rate which really hurt me She knows that s what I needed and she went from seemingly caring to switching completely when things weren t going her way I told her she was a poisonous cow and there were a few irrelevant lines exchanged after that then it stopped This was 3pm and I was waiting for a reply 8pm I noticed she blocked me on WhatsApp She s never done this before this is also the first argument we d had in 18 months I cried my eyes out to my husband night saying she didn t care and that there are a completely different set of rules and expectations for us as sisters I work from home and the next day I was so exhausted from crying all night and not sleeping that I rang in sick and I just slept on and off all day with my curtains drawn and felt so shit My husband who would never ever normally get involved called my sister to speak to her that morning He is honestly so polite and tries to be impartial at all times He told her I m not having a good time he was worried about me I didn t feel like I had any family etc and she seemed to get a bit upset herself He suggested we take a day or a few away from each other and without saying it directly suggested she reach out when we had cooled off 4 weeks passed still blocked Her husband invited my husband to do a marathon training run together they did and when her husband dropped mine off at home in the car he raised the row My husband said I was blocked and that sent a message in itself Another 2 weeks passed then she unblocked me seemingly waiting for me to make the first move I d be happy to do this but in my experience my sister is NEVER over an argument and if you approach her at any point afterwards it is just another opportunity to drag you over hot coals again She literally is so pissy and difficult to talk to without her forcing an apology out of you even if she had a huge part to play in the issue After she unblocked me another 6 weeks passed 3 months she s avoided me for during my pregnancy this is something she would 100 have disowned me for if I did to her I d never be allowed to forget it my life actually wouldn t be worth living This weekend just gone her husband had been pressing my husband all week to meet him for a drink They met at a pub for a few hours had a few drinks and he was basically saying that I needed to reach out and apologise for calling my sister poisonous and calling them tight fisted Basically insinuating I d be giving birth and not having them involved in my child s life if I didn t grovel My husband is super polite but he told me after a few drinks he lost his temper a bit and said there is absolutely no way I am going home to my pregnant wife who is about to give birth in a matter of weeks and telling her she needs to apologise for this mess and he basically said it s not going to get resolved then because my sister wasn t willing to reach out My husband also said he got the impression that my sister had fully considered the long term effects of this My husband also said that her husband said my sister was actually growing increasingly annoyed about me not reaching out because I hadn t seen my niece in 3 months May I repeat that my sister is the most unapproachable person when she s in a bad mood and this is the longest she s ever gone without talking to me and I already had the impression she was using my niece as bait to make me come running to her despite feeling like she has abandoned me first by booking a holiday when I m due and secondly by being absent for half of my pregnancy and certainly during the darkest time of it when I felt really low and poorly My husband came home we talked I cried and we said we needed to just accept they weren t going to be around at all when I gave birth and that they weren t too bothered about it therefore we should stop worrying about it Side note we have our suitcases stored in their loft until we have ours boarded out and I need one for my hospital bag genuinely been a concern for a while now So I said to my husband I m not willing to hang on a few weeks and then ask to collect them because it will drag everything up again and it will look like we re trying to start a conversation about it again So my husband asked her husband if he could collect them next week he said yes Then later in the evening he said what if I spoke to my sister and got her to call tonight and my husband asked me how I d feel I said I was fine with it He then replied again saying she s going to need some more convincing plus their daughter was poorly and they had their hands full that night plus my sister had a part time job application to fill before Friday so she was busy It s now early hours Saturday and she s not called If I know my sister she will be going through the last WhatsApp chat with a fine tooth comb to find anything she can trip me up on to blame this on me She keeps the receipts for absolutely everything I m nervous to talk to her because she will beat me with the stick I hand to her basically If I tell her I felt low and heartbroken when she cut me off she will use it against me If I act calm and nonchalant she will tell me I don t care and I ve just caused trouble and it hasn t even affected me She is extremely extremely sensitive to words and I know she s after an apology for the poisonous and tight fisted comments Whereas it wouldn t shock me if she then didn t apologise for any of the above Every argument is about winning and dishing out maximum punishment for anyone who dare cross her I should add that in the last message from her husband he said She s dropping a shit load of pride to reach out My husbands jaw dropped I know my husband has seen a different side to them both in this argument and we ve agreed that if we sort things out for the sake of our kids etc then we will be giving them a much wider berth My sister has always been beyond sensitive when it comes to any kind of feedback conflict confrontation but her husband who she s been with since she was 17 is the same and they make each other worse sitting at home plotting and validating each others reactions I feel so sick with myself for all of the stuff I ve done for her over the years I ve had crushing pain in my chest all night knowing that I could be having a conversation with her this weekend where I ll probably go to pot and won t get anything across in my defence This has ruined most of my pregnancy I ve thought about it every day since it happened and I ve not been able to escape it We live in the same small town and I ve been terrified of bumping into her in our local town centre for months She s really let me down I actually don t know if I can fully forgive her but also if I tell her things won t be the same and we need a healthier distance between us because we re so different then she will flip it and say well what s the point of talking about this if we re not going to go back to the way things were I can t do it to myself this one sided relationship anymore What would you do",34.0,female,sister,30-39

text body: Some backstory My mom had me when she was 19 She always told me that she prayed that someone would love her unconditionally and when she got unexpectedly pregnant while she was nowhere near ready it was God sending me to her so she would have someone that would love her no matter what She was married to my brother s dad for a while and then they split up and since then we have lived in a number of different states and she has had a number of different boyfriends none staying super long My mom and I always had a rocky relationship as she refuses to get help for mental issues that make her borderline narcissistic but I always reminded myself that if I just got to 18 I could go to college and the distance would make it easier and better for both of us A few years ago my aunt who my mother had always been extremely close to died out of the blue at a fairly young age Ever since then my mom hasn t been the same She s constantly depressed she doesn t like doing the things she used to and she s developed this mentality that the universe is punishing her for something and everyone always leaves her All things that I understand come with grieving the issue is that she refuses to get help That brings us to August of this past year I decided to go to a college about 3 hours from home and I come back from school semi regularly about once every two months but sometimes more I have been dating my current boyfriend for a year and we are long distance since he goes to college 7 hours away from our home town I see my boyfriend and hang out with my friends at home a lot as this is the first time I ve had a real friend group because of all the moving throughout middle and high school My mom since I left for school has been constantly more depressed and begging me to come home I once asked her if she just thought I was going to live at home forever and she responded with a genuinely upset Yes Earlier this week she came into my room to say goodnight and was visibly upset I asked what was wrong and she started crying and said she felt like she died when my aunt did and that she just doesn t want to or feel motivated to do anything anymore all signs of textbook depression which I also have and am medicated for She then went on to say that she s upset that my boyfriend comes before her and one day I m going to have my own family as if it was a bad thing that I may have my own family one day I told her he does not come before her and she said he does She mentioned the other day when she had to make the hour drive to my grandmother s house at 6AM and was upset I didn t come knowing that my boyfriend had slept over the night before and we were out with friends until 1AM I said I was sorry and I felt bad but one day I will have my own family and I hope she d be happy and want that for me and of course I d still want to see her and have her be a part of my life I just want to help her stop feeling like this and I don t know how to It s weighing on me so heavily and everything I do without her makes me have this pit in my chest and intense guilt for wanting to have a life separate from her because her life has revolved around me since I was born I just don t know what to do",19.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: I 18F am very close with my dad My dad s parents my grandparents were my role models growing up We would visit them several times a year My grandmother would bake cookies from scratch always oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip and she always seemed happiest when we were in her kitchen My grandfather would take us on his motorcycles and laugh as we watched History channel documentaries about Bigfoot and other silly stuff My grandma didn t just send birthday cards she made handmade cards for every single holiday even obscure ones you don t usually get cards for She d write sweet little notes inside just like you d expect from the perfect grandma I kept most of them in a box because they felt like little pieces of her I adored them I genuinely looked up to them and wanted to grow up to be like them kind thoughtful involved They were the people I bragged about having in my life I loved them so much and for most of my life I believed that love was simple safe and unquestioned But that changed When I was 11 years old my family and I flew to visit my mom s side of the family for Christmas When we got back to the airport in our home state we realized the battery had died So we called my uncle who lived nearby and he picked us up He dropped us off at my grandparents who agreed to let us stay until we got the car fixed It was an unexpected visit but they were hospitable nonetheless One night I woke up late in the guest room to hear yelling My dad got me up and told me to pack up that we were leaving I was confused but I did so anyway I carried my sleepy 6 year old sibling in my arms as I walked out the front door just in time to see my grandfather screaming at my dad calling him a b stard and stupid in front of me Hey kids Tell your stupid dad to get off my property was his exact wording I don t really remember how I felt at the time I was just confused probably We left My uncle came and drove us to a car rental place which my dad had tried to avoid doing We went home that night and that was that There was no explanation for this incident We just didn t visit them anymore We didn t talk about it When my great grandmother my paternal grandmother s mom passed away when I was 12 it hit me really hard because I loved her dearly I saw my grandparents at the funeral and avoided them because it felt weird Even though I had no idea what had happened that night there was this new air of tension that I couldn t shake I was too busy grieving my great grandmother who had just passed It was the first funeral I d ever gone to My grandfather attempted to make amends with my dad at it but nothing went anywhere I didn t understand until a year later when I was 13 and my dad sat me down and told me about his childhood He carefully explained that his parents had verbally and physically abused him his entire childhood They were cruel to both him and my uncle Name calling religious guilt ridicule and outright bullying were among the things they endured And it was bad My dad suffered from what I had noticed but had not realized were PTSD symptoms my entire life Even now in his 50s my father is sensitive to sudden noises When he had kids he made a conscious decision to try to rebuild some kind of relationship with his parents so that we could have grandparents in our lives But that night the tension that had been building for over a decade finally broke and the truth about who they really were came crashing down around us Honestly I was heartbroken and I still am It was a strange situation to process My dad was and still is my best friend My favorite person in the whole world He has really broken the cycle of abuse He s the best father I could ask for and nothing like his parents Finding out that he had been dealing with things I had no clue about was really confusing and frustrating I wasn t angry at him for not telling me sooner I understood how difficult that choice must have been From 13 to 14 I had other stuff going on so I didn t really deal with what I was feeling about that situation But the pain kept coming back when I least expected it A few months after I found out my dad and I were on a trip when his brother called to say their father was in the hospital and might be dying My dad drove us to the hospital and I stayed in the waiting room while he went to visit He let me decide if I wanted to go I said no I was angry I still am By 15 I started to really understand how much the grandparent thing hurt me When seeing an 18 wheeler with their small town s name on it made me start crying it was a clear sign something was wrong The people I loved and trusted most had betrayed me decades ago and I had no idea Every kind thing they did felt tainted I had been loving people who had abused the most important person in my life I can t imagine the pain my dad might ve felt hearing me say I wanted to be like them when I grew up My dad has genuinely made peace with it and healed in his own way and I am so proud of him He has reminded me that he is okay that he has processed the trauma of what happened to him He doesn t care about his relationship with them He knows what happened wasn t his fault But this whole thing has impacted me in a way I didn t expect I m still processing the pain of this betrayal It s a strange situation to find out what a family member did but what happened didn t directly happen to you I feel all this anger and betrayal and sadness I can t look at photos of me with them or think about their house without imagining my dad as a child crying scared and alone It taints all those memories and it hurts a lot It didn t even happen to me What sucks is I don t know anyone else who s been through this How do I move past this anger towards them I hate that they weren t actually kind people They were just as terrible as they were all those decades ago My dad is okay so why can t I be okay Having genuinely good grandparents was something I cherished and now every time I hear my friends or other people talk about their grandparents I feel the burn of envy I really wanted to have my grandparents at my graduation at my wedding etc I wanted to have them there because they were important to me They were in so many of my childhood memories The pain has faded a bit over the years but now at 18 I m still processing my anger and trying to forgive them I m reminded of this because I received the news the other day that my grandfather is very ill and likely going to pass away soon I feel nothing and I m not ashamed of feeling nothing about it I know damn well I m not attending that funeral I m grieving the loss of how I used to know my grandparents How they once were perceived by my child mind This is whole situation is what I ve been working through for the past 8 years And it s painful It really weighs on me and has been the source of so much anger and pain It s hard to put into words really I hate that I share blood with them I hate that I m always tied to them no matter what I know I m not like them and I never will be To put it plainly I m just sad I don t miss them I don t want to speak to them or see them ever again I ve been to therapy and journaled and written unsent letters to them and everything but it s still here It didn t even happen to me but it still hurts So here I am sharing this because I don t really know how to process it all on my own I just want to hear people s thoughts or stories Sometimes it helps just to know you re not alone Thanks for reading It really means a lot",18.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: I 29f am the second of four girls We re all very close including our mom all are no contact with our father My parents younger sisters and I moved to a different state when I was a teenager and my older sister stayed because of her then boyfriend A couple years later she ends up needing out because he s become abusive My husband then boyfriend and I moved her in get her a car and a job and let her live there for free while she gets on her feet Six months later she ends up moving back to where we re from with one of her exs bestfriends and they end up together Fast forward 5 years and she moves in with my mom and younger sisters because he s also a druggie and becomes extremely abusive This time she moves in with her kids 5 7 now 3 5 at the time She lived with my mother for free for almost a year before she got a job She only applied for two jobs that first year The first one was where I worked at the time wfh and flex scheduling and the second was where she ended up working cleaning cabins She refused to put her youngest in daycare while her oldest was in school because she didn t want strangers watching them Which I get but you can t be a single SAHM with no job I suggested since she didn t get hired where I worked to look for other WFH jobs and she just never looked literally admits she never made a resume or looked When she moved here the kids were loud not normal loud angry screaming loud from living in an abusive house had no boundaries and were super emotional It s super clear to all of us they have PTSD The oldest told me the day she moved down here they moved because daddy hit mommy hard in the eye Well here we are two years later and she still has yet to do anything to help her kids Their behavior has gotten so much worse Her parenting style is letting them do what they want and if she needs them to do something she screams and they scream back She never follows through and the only time they ever actually end up listening is just if they have less willpower than her at the time She has told em before she just caves all the time because she would prefer to give them what they want instead of listen to them whine and cry We ve all told her the kids severely need therapy They re book smart but socially and emotionally super delayed and we re pretty sure it s because they have CPTSD She is around other children too and has admitted her kids have tantrums that are on par with a 2 3 year old instead of 5 7 year old So she knows it s not normal behavior yet she still isn t doing anything to help them either at home or getting them in therapy She also doesn t take the time to teach them anything because it s easier to do it herself so her youngest is five and still unable to dress herself brush her teeth wash herself and other things most kids can at least do with supervision or little help It s to the point our mother other sisters and I all feel like it s neglectful The thing is their behavior is starting to have an impact on the rest of the family No one wants to be around her and her kids because every time they re around it turns into a screaming match between her and her kids that s so loud you can t have a conversation in the same house as them Her kids do have meltdowns and such other toddler like behavior when my sister isn t around but it s not as bad without her because they don t scream at everyone and we usually try and help them process their emotions instead of screaming at them for having them Here s where I m asking for help how do you navigate this kind of relationship When she s around with her kids she makes absolutely all of us miserable We always hung out as a family once or twice a week and it s down to about once a month now because no one wants to get together and listen to their screaming match To add to this she also has picked up a lot of toxic traits from being in abusive relationships for over a decade She is very manipulative and judgmental She is the oldest and regularly makes remarks about my sisters partners who are amazing to them simply because she s jealous that they re so young and are married and engaged She makes comments all the time that I don t let my kid watch tv at home and that cloth diapering is a waste of time She makes comments about me being spoiled simply because of my husband treating me well and sharing in his part of taking care of the house kids and cooking She complains about my youngest sister not holding a job because of her BPD even though she still only works part time after two years since she got out of her relationship She now lives with her new boyfriend and before they moved in with Him she would regularly leave her kids at home with my mom and sisters while she went to his house without even letting them know she was gone She regularly takes advantage of us when she gets a chance she ll ask for us to babysit so they can go on a date night motorcycle ride get a new tattoo or whatever but she won t ask us for help watching her kids so she can get a regular job I understand she s still probably processing years of trauma but it s really hard to want to maintain a relationship with someone who makes you miserable and takes advantage of you when they re not making any effort to better their life and neglecting their children s mental and emotional wellbeing",29.0,female,sister,20-29

text body: My partner and I have been together for almost five years We got together in 2020 but things really began a couple of years before that when we became friends through a Volunteering group VG Back then Harvey was openly gay but I wasn t not even to friends and family As far as my mum was concerned I was just a straight teenager without a girlfriend Harvey and I became close quickly and our relationship deepened from there We saw each other every Monday evenings through VG then started messaging daily playing Xbox and meeting up more often It wasn t long before our connection became more intimate and we became a couple on August 15th 2020 Months passed and eventually I knew I needed to tell my family I told a few close friends at first and then I told my mum one day as I was heading to work Harvey and I were now openly together and genuinely happy My mum always claimed that as long as I was happy she was happy but that didn t match how things felt At first she tolerated Harvey visiting and staying over but the atmosphere was often tense There was no outright hostility but also no warmth never a truly welcoming environment for him My half brother too reinforced her early doubts and beliefs They dismissed my relationship as just a phase a product of lockdown boredom something I d grow out of Despite my repeated efforts to explain that it wasn t a phase that I was serious about Harvey and happy they didn t listen To understand my mum you have to know her background she s unpredictable uneducated and had a difficult childhood foster care skipping school and losing her own mum young Still none of it excused the truly shocking comments and actions she made over the years I remember one moment We were all standing in the hallway at home Harvey came close and casually put his arm around me My mum looked at us visibly shocked and disgusted then she abruptly walked away It wasn t until weeks later that she brought it up to Harvey She said I could have just punched you for that Now I knew she d never lay a hand on him but he didn t No one would especially when you don t really know her Behind closed doors she would question me Are you sure you don t want to try being with a woman she d ask I always gave the same answer I knew who I was and what I wanted Each time she d repeat her line As long as you re happy Another time while Harvey was staying over again at mine I left for work and I d return in the afternoon My mum offered to take Harvey out for a walk with the dog During the drive she told him he should leave me That I was just bored That I wasn t really gay Harvey later told me he felt trapped in that car unable to speak unable to escape There have been good moments with my mum times we all laughed when she seemed to try but it was always hard to forget the deeper damage Even small nasty remarks that would re open bigger more hurtful wounds you were also never sure when the good times would abruptly end She d often say That s just how I am I say the wrong things sometimes you just have to get used to it Over time I repeatedly confronted her about her behaviour Especially the things she d say about Harvey s family She repeatedly called them snobs claimed Harvey s dad was having an affair which wasn t true and belittled the way they lived their lives It wasn t just about Harvey it was about the way she viewed anything different from her world She knew nothing about Harvey s family she d never even met them but that didn t stop her from making cruel comments When I pushed back and told her how inappropriate and untrue they were she d snap Am I not allowed to say anything without you coming at me Or it s just a joke On my 21st birthday she planned a family meal at a Hotel Harvey and I had been together for four years We arrived at her house ready to leave together However it turned out to be a surprise party at her home The night was surprisingly going well family friends and laughter I was shocked how well the night was going without incident Then I noticed her calling Harvey over I watched them talk and I felt uneasy When he came back he told me what she d said that he was controlling and jealous and that I was missing out finally saying that a friend that was at my party wasn t gay as if that mattered These weren t one off remarks She frequently asked if Harvey and I argued Did you argue she d ask after a weekend away or a normal day Most couples do argue occasionally but her obsession with it felt invasive even hopeful In her eyes I d lost my mojo and I wasn t the same funny person anymore all because of Harvey After the party we invited her over for a serious conversation She blamed the alcohol Morgan Spiced Rum and vodka but we reminded her that these kinds of comments had also come when she was sober She eventually admitted she was wrong and apologised She also admitted she was in a way jealous We made progress that day and I told her clearly if the remarks didn t stop I d walk away For a while things improved Harvey continued to make effort He messaged her visited her house included her But slowly the comments crept back in She d say things like Hello stranger making it seem like Harvey was the one not reaching out even though it was always him who made the effort When we visited she d focus all her attention on me ignoring Harvey entirely It became exhausting Eventually Harvey stopped messaging She didn t reach out either and the silence between them grew I still saw her on occasion but from November to January maybe even longer They didn t see or speak to each other During this time Harvey left his job and we were 100 fine financially We chose not to tell her knowing she d make it into a bigger deal than it was We explained it was handled but she saw through it watching for signs checking if Harvey s car was home asking indirectly is Harvey working today We told her the truth we didn t tell her because we didn t want to hear the endless worry speculation and judgment Of course she responded with Am I not allowed to worry But it wasn t worry it was criticism wrapped in concern Over the years Harvey became numb to her comments He tolerated them Occasionally they d have a good conversation but you never knew how long it would last One day they bumped into each other at the park and spoke for over an hour They talked about Harvey s past relationships and his mental health At the end of the conversation she said to him Since you re medicated now you won t be ungrateful and try and kill yourself again He told me later and I wasn t shocked just deeply hurt He asked me not to confront her I didn t But that moment stuck with me Eventually I started to mirror her own behaviour nasty remarks sarcasm just to show her how it felt When I made a joke in return she went into a huff and later sent a message accusing me of enjoying making her feel stupid She blamed Harvey too saying he encouraged me by laughing like a schoolboy That message crossed a line I replied and reminded her she d been making cruel remarks for years and I was done pretending they didn t affect me She told me the past was in the past That she couldn t trust Harvey because he twisted things and tried to turn me against her But nothing was twisted Harvey never exaggerated If anything he tolerated too much I called her angry and disappointed She denied everything Then hung up before I could finish I called back six times She didn t answer So I wrote to her a handwritten letter explaining that I no longer wanted contact This isn t about one argument I wrote It s about years of pain I wish things could have been different but they haven t changed For my own well being and my relationship I need to step away Since then we haven t spoken What I find most interesting in all of this is that my mum genuinely believes Harvey made up the comment she said to him that he won t be ungrateful anymore and try to kill himself again But Harvey would never lie about something so serious especially not that It s not in his nature and it s not who he is And even more telling if his goal had ever been to make me stop speaking to her why did he endure so much for so long Why did he sit through those awkward visits the uncomfortable silences the cruel remarks and the passive aggressive jabs If he truly wanted us to fall out he wouldn t have needed to fabricate anything He could have just pointed to all the real things she said and actions that occurred long before now But he never did He never once asked me to cut contact Even though deep down I imagine he wished I would Since then I ve cut contact with her entirely Still despite everything I genuinely wish her well I believe she will always carry a deep resentment toward Harvey and a lingering disappointment in me but I stand by my decision It wasn t easy but it was necessary All of this tells me everything I need to know about who he is and who she chooses to be I want to get more opinions about this Any responses will be appreciated First time I ve ever second guessed myself",21.0,male,son,20-29

text body: I m not really sure what I expect to come from this post honestly probably nothing This is my first Reddit post and I don t even know if I m posting it to the right place I just feel so overwhelmed and unheard and I guess I m just looking for a space where someone might understand and tell me its not all in my head and I m not a big crybaby for feeling like this and guide me on how to make this treatment stop I 16F have a younger sister 13F and it feels like she can t go a single day without bullying me I ve tried convincing myself that it s just normal sibling bickering and maybe we ll bond when we re older but that hope gets dimmer every day The truth is I hate how much I resent her I feel so guilty for feeling that way but the more I interact with her the stronger the hatred gets Looking back this probably started when we were little Our parents version of discipline involved me taking the brunt of the punishments usually yelling and beatings while my sister was apparently learning from watching me suffer Same mistake different consequences kinda thing For her just seeing me get beaten and cry was apparently enough of a lesson But instead of taking it as a warning I think she just grew up believing I was the mistake She learned to use that to her advantage When our parents were at work she d say things like If you don t do ___ for me I ll tell Dad you did ___ And as a kid terrified of my father I d always give in She held small things against me like sneaking extra candy for months I d get punished for stuff she made me do When I finally told my dad about it he just laughed He told her That s not a good thing to do and that was it No accountability No protection Just me still the punching bag Now the blackmail has lessened but the emotional jabs haven t They re constant Little degrading comments that chip away at my self esteem I m incredibly involved in school and extracurriculars I m in the IB program French immersion I wrestle for both my school and a local team I volunteer and I advocate for youth mental health especially eating disorders I leave home at 6 45 am and usually don t get back until 9 30 10 pm Meanwhile my sister doesn t even wake up until I ve left the house and gets home by 4 30 at the latest Even with all that free time she refuses to do chores mainly the dishes Then she complains I don t help enough and somehow convinces my dad I m lazy and living off him She constantly ropes my parents into things If I leave drops of water on the bathroom counter she yells for me to wipe it which my mom ends up hearing and I get yelled at If I meal prep with the last of an ingredient she wanted she ll call me fat even though I m not but I was chubby as a kid and she knows it s a sensitive spot She mocks my intelligence She insults me for no reason And when I finally snap and say shut up I get yelled at not her What hurts the most is how cold she is I say I love you to her almost every day usually in passing like bye love you She hasn t said it back since she was too young to know what it meant But she has no issue telling me she hates me that she wishes I were dead or that she wishes I weren t her sister I feel like she s breaking me My self confidence is at an all time low I overthink every interaction I don t start conversations unless someone clearly shows they want to talk to me because of how many times I ve been shut down by her when I talked about something I care about If I speak passionately about something I told to yap on and on she ll say things like Does your mouth ever get tired of talking Everyone laughs I fake a laugh too But inside I just feel smaller and smaller I don t like talking to her I avoid asking her for anything If I ask for a glass of water when she s right next to the sink she ll call me lazy and walk away so she can say she s too far and since I m closer I should do it myself If I ask her to come back and close the door after she leaves my room she pretends she can t hear me I know some of this sounds like typical sibling stuff but it doesn t feel typical when it s every day and when it s so mean She won t even send me pictures of myself when we go on trips I ve had to sneak them from her phone when she s asleep One time she left her phone unlocked on the table so I sent myself a photo I d been begging her to share for I think over a day at that point She got mad and reached for her phone and when I playfully held it out of her reach she pulled on my hijab In public Exposing my hair I reacted I pushed her away and slapped her arm My dad saw that and charged at me He had that look in his eyes the one that always means he s going to hit me It looks so hateful and I m always brought to tears because how can you look at your own child like that My aunt stepped in and stopped him but by then I was already crying and just walked away He later said he was only that angry because I m a wrestler and should be mindful of my strength But I always have to be mindful I always have to hold back She never gets told off for starting things insulting me or getting physical I always get in trouble for defending myself I just feel hated By her By my parents sometimes They ve done nothing real to stop her behavior And I feel like such a pushover for letting it keep happening It s affected how I act with everyone I barely speak up even with close friends People think I m mad or cold but I m just afraid of beingtld to stop talking or annoying people I know I sound sensitive But that s because I am sensitive And when I ask her to stop she tells me I m too soft or too emotional and that I need to toughen up to which I just walk away because crying or lashing out in front of her really does nothing but encourage her I feel like I m overthinking this again and just hurting myself but I m literally just so tired of feeling like a bad person or stupid or fat or ugly all at the hands of my sister Am I really just overthinking everything and need to wait it out before it gets better I m starting to feel like I don t want her at my milestones like my high school grad or even my wedding because she doesn t bring the love and happiness I want to feel on those days Do I need to have ANOTHER sit down with my family and tell them how I feel even though I know nothing will come of it Do I just wait and move far away for university and cut most contact with her",16.0,female,sister,10-19

down the line but we have only been dating around a year We both decided to be pragmatic and have an elopement with only two witnesses no parents at the ceremony itself to keep things fair Of course we told all 4 of our parents and they were all completely fine with the situation they understand the reasoning with the navy and can see that we are completely enamoured with each other We were witnessed by our best friends one of each Another important note is that my brother has been in a toxic relationship with a woman my entire family despises for over 2 years now It s been very hard to watch especially with how she treats him but I ve tried to support him by just being his brother and when I try to talk to him about it he shuts me out and refuses to tell me how he feels I ve kept my mouth shut about what I think of his partner and his relationship as that s not my place to say anything about All I can do is be the person that s happy to see him and support him If anyone wants further details I ll make an updated post with specifics Anyway to the crux of the issue I 25M just got married on Sunday it s Tuesday at the time of posting after a short but very sweet honeymoon with my now wife 29F I have been working with my brother 30M in another state about a 5 hour flight from home I worked with him for 3 weeks of every month and would take time to see my partner During that time he had a LOT to say about my relationship including some extremely disrespectful things about my partner most of which came during a rather interesting conversation about the things she wears I won t get into details but it infuriated me and hurt my partner s feelings a lot This obviously sucked and when I got home I searched for a job found one and then informed my brother I would not be coming back up to work with him He took this fine and he has no clue that I still feel upset with him due to other reasons including work and money troubles whilst I was there In any case as aforementioned he has been really struggling with work and particularly money lately and has organised some work with a big company that he was getting ready for just before my wedding Now to get to the part that makes me want to change my last name I have always had a particular dynamic with my father He has never been absent but he has a problem with showing up He fell asleep in the waiting room when I was born forgot about important events and was always late didn t turn up at all Eventually my mum got sick of it and divorced him when I was in kindergarten when he didn t show up for my Xmas party he fell asleep on the couch because he was tired from work my mother also worked full time and has continued to as a single mother to this day In any case this theme continued for the rest of my childhood football games parties you name it he would always say he would be there and when the time came no dad I genuinely didn t mind after a while I understood he was busy and had a life and he was a great dad whenever I was actually spending time with him I never needed him to show up to my things because I m quite independent as a person and didn t think most of the stuff was important enough for him to be there anyway Usually the only thing that would piss me off about it was that he would say he d be there then not come I have thought that he s been turning a new leaf lately as he has seemed a lot more involved in my life He s been supportive of the marriage seemed very excited about it and to celebrate with me This made me quite happy and he even suggested I host a party for family seems how the ceremony is small and they couldn t come I thought this was a great idea and so I organised it all inviting my partners side of the family to come and getting everyone on board My mother also invited her side of the family who my partner and I love and get along with very well Well I call my father 3 days after the initial conversation about the party to confirm it s organised he knew the exact day and date already and he goes oh shit Apparently his friends go mountain bike riding for a weekend in another state every year and one of them bailed out and called my dad to see if he wanted the ticket all expenses paid Him being in his own words his selfish self accepted this wonderful offer completely forgetting about his son s impending wedding party of which the actual wedding was the day after He then says he has that and can t come I was a bit taken aback but I want him to come to my wedding party because he wants to not because I told him he has to so I told him he can do that if he wants At the time I thought it wouldn t really bother me too much because it s a running theme in my life anyway and he still had the rest of the week to reconsider Well surprise surprise he didn t show up It was only when my uncle who is extremely unreliable showed up to my party because he heard it was on and dropped everything last minute that it hit me My father had every opportunity to come to the party and chose not to My uncle who is a chronic alcoholic and hated by half of the family was there to support me and show me love despite being busy that day To really top things off my mother invited to fly my brother down for the weekend for free to be there for the party and to spend time with family he s been having issues with his partner He also declined saying he was too busy with getting ready for the big job This coupled with the disrespect he s shown me lately really got to me I can t lie Both my brother and my father share my last name My mother has always been there for me and always shown up even when she didn t have to She s the most amazing person in my life bar my wife who understands me better than any human ever has I m already fairly certain I want to change my last name to my mother s and my wife agrees that she wants that name more anyway The real problem is how the fuck do I broach this subject with my brother and particularly my father without causing a massive rift Don t get me wrong I don t give a shit if they re upset about it they re going to be upset anyway I ve had it with being the bigger person keeping the peace and pretending nothing is wrong I haven t spoken up about being mad at my brother because he s going through a lot right now and I didn t want to add to it but I can t ignore that he s really done me wrong What I do really care about is not permanently harming my relationship with them I want to find a way to broach it that s not spiteful I was thinking of mentioning that because I believe my wife is my equal I find it fair for both of us to change our last names Seems how her parents are still together there s only one last name we could both change to my mother s which she loves and she s fully on board with it Please if I could get some advice on how to go about talking to my father and to a lesser degree my brother about changing my last name from theirs Sorry for the long post and again I can update with any further information context if I missed anything",25.0,male,brother,20-29
My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage,"title: My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage

text body: I 22 F and my fiancé 24 M just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that Since the very beginning of our relationship it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother 62 F Now it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding Let me explain After my now fiancé and I began dating I began to tell my mom about him since I was obviously excited about this new relationship Some of her biggest gripes were that he s nothing more in her mind than a backwoods redneck and essentially that I m too good for him But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long time Jehovah s Witnesses Ever since I told her this she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had Example A She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up I told her no it really wasn t his thing and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork construction that he does now and never took much of an interest in sports She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn t done any sports since he couldn t do anything that would put him around being people that weren t JW I know this is true within the religion but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young I ve tried to explain this as not true but she simply won t accept it Example B I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in After dating for almost a year I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living Ever since I ve moved and especially after I told her about our engagement all she does is say that I ve been sucked in She s convinced I m in a cult She s also said she hates my ex boyfriend who cheated on me to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him Example C Since starting working post college I ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into fundraising and I haven t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before I ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home since I have learned that cleaning cooking and decorating are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall She says I m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from even after I had said many times I didn t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new and find a nice boy down there to settle down with Example D Since announcing our engagement she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare When I told her our initial wedding date she asked why we were rushing it I told her we just didn t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married She grilled me and said I must be pregnant and what happened to having a long engagement She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and or borderline personality disorder She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer we live 4 5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up she told me it was already too late this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating She s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family When we weren t speaking a couple months back she didn t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because I didn t ask how the dog was I never got a chance to say goodbye Before this she had previously called me at 12 30 am after we hadn t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent 10 000 at the casino Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should ve never asked All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself our relationship as he calls it When I told my mother the date she said it was too soon and that she didn t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn t help me with the wedding I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would and she said yes I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors While this was true after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship Ever since we ve been arguing pretty consistently The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement He s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I m in But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I m going to be loyal to him not to my mom The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some and he s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to since it is a small town here My in laws are absolutely incredible and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom We often go out to lunch together and just spend a lot of time together overall Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing My mom is my only family since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn t close with any of her siblings and all my grandparents are gone I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else How do I prove myself to my fiancé How do I stick up to my mother and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her Can I salvage a relationship with both of them My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me like being the parent that stayed when my dad left But I also love my fiancé more than anything and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us He s said he s just been in a down mood in general he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness I ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings Thank you in advance for any advice",22.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: For context I am a 24 yo woman and in a lesbian relationship My parents got divorced when I was young and both have raised me in a very non confrontational environment I ve always been scared of conflict and of punishment or anything of the sort Sorry this may be a long post but I just don t know what to do I live in a major city in my state and almost five hours away from my hometown I moved here for school and in my undergrad with Covid and different class schedules I came home a lot more often I also didn t really have friends here so I was usually in communication with my parents When I started work and grad school my visits home and communication dwindled I also got into my first relationship ever and it has been an incredible healthy one she s not afraid to talk about her emotions and face issues head on rather than let time and emotions fester My mom met her first she was visiting my city and it was a great first meeting I have not been home very often during the time of our relationship and there are two incidents where we planned to go to my hometown and we decided to leave a day early The first was Christmas and we were going to see other family and the second was just decided because we were honestly bored at home in my small town and wanted to see my partner s grandmother who was in the hospital My mom clearly took offense to this and I could tell from how she texted and called me a few weeks after that Both my partner and I tried to squash any uneasy feelings and try to move forward but my mom clearly got the wrong impression of our relationship This past Thanksgiving I went home and my mom basically confronted me and asked me about my relationship saying she s worried I don t have a voice of my own This really upset me and I tried to explain how much I have grown as a person and how good of a person my partner is just as a person and as my partner I asked my dad about his thoughts on my relationship and he was very vague which is typical I asked my younger brother and he told me that my parents who hardly talk as is talk about my relationship and not in a positive way This deeply upset me and I should have sat them both down then and talked about it When my partner and I were planning for the Christmas holiday then I sent both my parents a detailed text of our plan so there would be no room to misunderstand any plans on leaving early as we had other relatives to see I also expressed some of my feelings how I felt they were treating me and my relationship like I am a teenager rather than a young adult woman They seemed to take it okay When we got there it was amicable at my dad s house When we went to my mom s my partner and I were trying so hard to engage with her in conversation but she seemed almost in a daze She was clearly upset Now this has been my last semester in grad school and things have been more distanced with my parents We already don t have a huge phone call every day texting relationship but spaced out across the weeks giving life updates Things seemed to start going okay They were proud of me for completing my master s degree Skip forward to today and I find out that I missed a deadline by three days to walk the stage I am still graduating but I don t have a spot reserved in my commencement ceremony I m not that upset about this but mortified thinking about how I m gonna tell my parents and how they re going to react I ended up calling my dad first since he asked a question relevant to graduation and I explained the situation and some alternative ideas to celebrate He seemed disappointed but not like he really cared and texted me a few minutes later about an unrelated thing But then my mom texted me saying my dad had already called her so no need to call me Upset that my dad took away my chance to talk about it to her myself I sent a long text explaining the situation and again alternative celebration ideas I asked to call her and she was clearly upset choked up She basically was like I just don t know what to do with us and how every time I try to ask you about something you always become so defensive so mainly her being upset about our communication We both said we d collect our thoughts and call sometime soon but I am just so lost on how to approach it all I feel that my parents view me as a love blind child and not the adult who has blossomed by myself and with my partner I feel like with their limited perception of her and trust we ve tried different ways to get around and given suggestions they think she s a bad influence on me or somehow abusive or keeping me away from them I have tried before to explain myself and I m worried I m never going to be heard But I know I have to try Thank you if you ve read all of this and thank you in advance to any advice",24.0,female,daughter,20-29

My family Problems  (Filipino Edition),"title: My family Problems  (Filipino Edition)
author: Unable-Tree6262
text body: Let s get annoyed together Hi I m just here to rant about my family I know not everyone is perfect blah blah blah but there are just some things that annoy me so freaking much Buckle up buttercup Get ur glasses and some snacks bc good god this is long Oh and trigger warning if ur homophobic or whatever For context I m Filipino my parents and their siblings came to America and procreated like many other immigrants The reason being a better life as that s usually the reason So that makes me second generation Let s say half of my family went on to go get blue collared jobs while the other half just couldn t let go of their old ways remember that When I say old ways I mean like working hours on a farm growing plants selling them and forcing their own kids to work with them And before you say child labor or whatever earning money is hard and heck why not teach your kids the family trade and how you make money for the family This was one good thing that helped shaped some of us it made us humble and learned to appreciate things more yk I say some bc there were the few spoiled brats I don t blame them at all farming is good honest hard work And it s nothing to be ashamed for but it s not for everyone Here we go Note These are in no particular order or ranked a certain way Problem 1 CONTROL Farming As I ve mentioned farming is how some of my family lived and worked to get by Love or hate it but never look down on it Now what s the problem You ask It s the fact that for me personally my family created a business out of it That s good right Yes it is However it s the fact that my parents tried to really PUSH me and my siblings into joining the family business When I say push I mean force us to work and operate things To them it s easier to hire family bc they can easily control us Heck my older sister had to major in business in college so they could shackle her to doing the taxes invoices emails online work for the business While my mom handled paper work and work logs and me and my other sister did loading unloading cargo packs the products quality control physical labor And it s not like animals or eggs NO it s plants produce grows in the soil big ass plants grows in acres of land shit I used to like our family farm but grew to dislike it bc of all that work AND pressure from my parents When my sisters got jobs their farm work lessened but when I tried to get a job I was told no Yes my parents told me no Why Because they decided that my only opinions were our family farm or other relatives farms Like WTF I DONT WANT TO WORK ON ANY DAMN FARM I was 16 when I asked that bc I wanted money Not under the table money not mommy or daddies money my own money made from my sweat and tears at a job of MY choice Like I get it I guess Not everyone wants to work on a farm and finding workers is harder but that doesn t mean you can keep me here So where s my dad in all of this well news flash he s the boss He calls the shots takes the calls makes the connections He has the final say besides my mom in what goes and stays And remember how I said they like to control us if anyone of us did something wrong or messed up even by a little we would get it BOOM An earful a whole ass scolding lecture whatever you name it AND bc we re family objects came into play His hand could be a weapon those standing fans the tv a hanger slipper etc We re their own kids but sometimes it was hard for them to see that Love Tough love Where Puhh lease Spare me the details on the wild goose chase for love Problem 2 SEXISM Like most Filipino families or just families in general who have to deal with power dynamics or perhaps sexism suffocating gender roles etc Mine clearly just can t get rid of it Welcome to my experiences as a young woman I ll mainly be talking about my mothers side of the family for this part My mothers family those who have immigrated to the u s at least consists of my grandparents and their kids my mom her siblings of 7 Those 7 are 3 girls and 4 boys Out of 7 only 6 ended up creating families of their own with the 7th youngest spending his days trying to woo a woman Each family had either 2 5 kids with the average being 5 And most of those kids ended up being girls That s where I come in Being a girl in itself is always a challenge BUT being a girl in a semi sexist family well it definitely ain t any easier All the girls in the family end up being smart or at least make smarter decisions pretty respectful fierce with a little bit of trauma When I mean trauma oh boy it varies As for all the boys in the family I suppose they re not so smart a lil stupid nice and hella stubborn except for some the younger ones they re sweethearts Now you re probably wondering how odd my descriptions are but I can assure it comes with a good reason Discipline Yes what starts this whole shift in treatment is how we were all disciplined Here s an example of how things usually go Say we have a brother and sister they ask they re parents if they can go out and hang out with some friends Simple right No Ofc it s isn t SIMPLE or FAIR The parents say that the brother can go heck they quickly dismiss him to leave already And the sister The mom is already on her ass about a secret boyfriend getting pregnant staying out too late doing bad things the whole sha bang And the dad He stays firm raises his voice to say she is not allowed to go As all this is happening the boy is out and about being reckless in someone else s car probly drinking getting hurt Do you see it yet The huge ass gap right there between what a girl vs boy can do And heck even if the brother comes back in the morning hung over they brush him off as being a boy Still don t see it Okay here s another It s a big party maybe a debut for a just turned 18 daughter celebrating her womanhood like a Quinceanera or a sweet 16 Everyone is having fun laughing enjoying the food and DRINKS Drinks huh The girl that has just turned 18 is hanging out with all the adult cousins and they bring out some shots Can she drink Ding ding ding That right SHE CANT Her parents give her a look that could kill But look at that the younger boy cousins who aren t even 18 or 21 and they re drinking beer A shot of alcohol vs bottle of beer Do you feel angry yet Do you feel annoyed that these boys aren t being disciplined the same way as the girls It s because these parents don t stop the boys from doing stupid shit that they think it s okay Heck if the girl breathes even a little gets too fat isn t lady like isn t home by 10 isn t this or that she s probly already grounded And thus I introduce depression Yay now she has depression from the inequality oh why aren t you celebrating My aren t the parents happy that they ve restricted they re daughter SO MUCH to the point of depression so she doesn t get hurt All the parents think about right now is providing for the family they have everything to give their kids a good life So why is they re beloved daughter not so happy Oh well they ll probly ground her for being an ungrateful child Hey remember she s 18 she can finally leave that wretched place Far far away but oh no That s a big no no from her parents And thus they ve guilt tripped her into staying Gosh That was a looooot huh Do you need one more Okay just one My OWN experience When I was younger maybe 5 or so I would hang out at my cousins house after school I d stay there until my parents got off work to pick me up At my cousins house we d play all sorts of games animals cards house best coconut leaf whistle potion making etc Everyone was chill girls together and boys together But at some point my boy cousins let s call them ER EM took the initiative in making MY life miserable Yes me Idk why and I haven t asked them till this day bc they ve changed for the better Every day after school ER EM would bully me till I cried They insulted me took my things trashed my bag heck stole my snack push me Yk usual bully things It got so bad to the point 5 year old me wanted to walk home in the middle of the road Yes I wanted to All I ever did was be nice to them bc I was told that I should treat others how I wanted to be treated At school they re angels but at home Devils I ended up not going to their house anymore and being picked up and dropped off SEPARATELY Our parents have talked it out and they ve been scolded repeatedly but nothing got through their hard heads But only their sweet father did the scolding I felt bad for him their mother Oh for the love of god SHE FUCKING BABIED THEIR ASSES No wonder the scolding didn t get through their heads ALL THAT BREATHE WASTED ON TRYING TO STOP UR HORRIBLE CHILDREN FROM KILLING YOUR NIECE AND YOU BABY THEM She felt so fucking bad for her sons more than her niece that wanted to Heck even Niki s mom saw what I was trying to do at the time and stopped me Of course I wasn t alone one of my closest cousins had a heart RIAN My sister even tried to get them back but boys being boys laughed it off That shit didn t stop until middle school but by that time the damage was done My once happy go lucky child self died to become more reserved and insecure While I got bullied they got babied Equal exchange right According to their mom it definitely was Ngl I m still salty about them throwing away my hard earned Pokémon cards Take it all in baby we re still not done Problem 3 GRANDCHILDREN WHEN Associating women with children It s been a combo since the beginning of time or whatever I ll still be talking about my mothers side of the family Let s be real here I ain t gonna get mushy over kids or babies I don t have baby fever and quite frankly neither do most of my cousins I m a girl if you havent figured it out yet lol I never saw the appeal when I was younger maybe only bc I was playing house to pass time I m older now not a child anymore so the aunties and uncles are asking if I have a bf or gf I ll come back to this or any kind of relationship That s the usual as relatives do get all up in your business They don t actually care some of them and are just nosy ANYWAYS I may not be at the age of serious baby talks but you know who is That s right fellow reader my sisters I ve mentioned that they both have jobs but they also have boyfriends of their own Good for them Oh no here comes my FATHER Yes my father I wonder what he wants When are you having kids HUHHH I get that they re old enough but like kids In this economy tho That s all parents ask their kids for when they get old And my father of all people who literally demanded to have grandchildren a man asking for a woman to go through all that fucking pain for some kids I get it he s getting old and my pet cat won t suffice as his grandchild my cat is my child lol So his next best options are my older sisters in hopes that they ll make some babies And yes they will but for by their own choice to Good lord That should be enough right RIGHT Nah You thought wrong Back to me My parents ask if I m planning to have kids HELL NO I ve already said I hate dislike kids If I did have ANY at all MAYBE one The chances of that happening tho are very very very VERY slim I don t want to buss my own body up to birth a child I like being single and free it s hard enough to take care of myself But a kid my own offspring who will probly suffer from the same mental illness given to me by my parents As if I d rather date a women and not have any kids my blood or not Yes a women Oh and slight warning I like both men and women Yes both Here s where the next problem comes in Problem 4 STUCK TO THE OLDWAYS MINDSET Piggybacking off of the last problem of my sexuality I am bisexual Meaning I like both men and women Why is that a problem you ask again for the 100th time probly Well not everyone accepts that They don t agree with same gender couples having a love life And that s okay we all don t see things the same and we don t need to Just respect or ignore em We re harmless However the thought of my parents precious daughter living her life with no kids let alone with a WOMAN is barbaric and wrong There is nothing wrong I m being dramatic for the explanation My family or mainly the women who have come straight from the Philippines have a certain mindset that has been hardwired into them the moment they ve been born Or rather those who have grown up with the idea of glorifying being married to a man be a good wife having a family showing off your kids or something Then take those ladies and put them into America but fast forward to when being gay is normal HALT It s not normal to these women And it will never be because they re stuck to their oldways or the Bible A man women couple is the only thing they consider valid or acceptable And for me I had to find out the hard way of their TRUE opinions of gay lesbian couples Like most people who ve struggle to come out to their friends or families I have come to the conclusion to NEVER come out Why My parents or mainly my mother does not accept same sex couples marriages For things to make a little more sense let s take a trip down memory lane A few years ago around the time my younger cousin let s call her CC started to date boys Every relationship was shit and toxic Until that is when she started to experiment with girls Maybe kiss one or two idk But one day CC brought me and my older cousin let s call her Niki to talk in private And in confidence CC shared that she was Lesbian we both accepted her and treated her normal Time skip a little to when CC is in a serious relationship with her gf RY Now she is ready to finally come out FULLY To her parents and her family The beans are spilled Everyone knows now but still have mixed opinions the girls are chill we still love her The boys don t give a flying fuck THE ADULTS That s were drama starts All the aunties have a 2 cents they want to give and the uncles are chill they acknowledge CC RY So where are CC s parents HELLA disappointed in their oldest daughter turning gay What s worse They treat her with EVEN more restrictions and rules because she came out Heck they openly dislike everything They talk shit about their own daughter to relatives my mother being one of them But is this affecting any of them No It s her life not theirs SO WHAT SO HARD to understand Back to the present I m with my mom in the car on our way to Niki s house I tell my mother that I ll be going to hang out with some friends on the weekend She asks who I say blue hair she says are you sure she s not your gf But with the most concerned look of dread Hint1 I respond is saying she s just a friend and it s only lunch My mother sighs in relief She better not be your gf Hint2 HUHH Okay now I m curious Before we get out of the car I ask we this Hey mom what do you think of CC being lesbian I wait in anticipation my gut is clenched as I stare at my mom waiting for her response CC is JUST CONFUSED she ll realize that she is wrong And will be with a man Those words sucker punched any thought of coming out at all At least not to my family And it killed any respect I had for my mother that night My mother spoke so stern and annoyed My gut dropped my eyes fighting the urge to not look angry or disappointed All I can muster is an oh and get out of the car I bolted to go tell Niki what I had just heard I hated no I loathed my mothers response so much I promised to never tell CC what I heard that night bc she likes my mom Ik I m protecting a hater but she s still my mom I knew my mother talked to CC s dad because that s her brother And I thought they would just listen to each other s problems So why didn t I think that maybe she s grown to dislike same sex couples even more So many thoughts races though my head that night yet there wasn t one that would consider the hate and disgust I d gotten from my mothers response There s more instances of my homophobic family but that s for another time My head hurts now Thank you for reading this far Here s a gold star I know there s worse as in my family and others but for now I ll end this one here But if you ve made it this far I have some questions for y all Feel free to answer any what are your thoughts on all of this did you relate did you feel anything what is your position in YOUR family Ex parent middle child grandparents idk I m just curious what are y all views on such matters And how it s been handled or would ve been handled in your family",16.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: So earlier today me F23 and my parents mainly my dad got into an argument about how they were so strict with me when I was growing up to the point where I depend on them for a lot of stuff nowadays which is bad for my age compared to how they treat my sister now who s 19 I was telling them how it s not fair that they let her do whatever she wants and barely ground her or discipline her whenever she acts up but if I were to do the same thing when I was her age I would be on house arrest grounded or have my phone taken away They said they re trying not to make the same mistakes that they did with raising me but I feel like they want her to succeed by giving her this freedom while I m still struggling to be independent due to them not teaching me certain life skills making me stay at home and focus on schoolwork and Covid quarantine The worst part is that my parents couldn t even apologize for creating these problems for me or whenever I ask my dad for help with something he gets mad bc he s the type to get upset about everything So basically what I m asking is AITA for crashing out on my parents well mainly my dad about my frustrations on being treated differently as a first born eldest daughter And how do I get over these feelings and deal with my dad since he doesn t wanna really take accountability or change his toxic behavior Let me know if you want more details on what happened bc there s a lot of stuff that happened in this argument but it s too much to type out for this post",23.0,female,daughter,20-29
Griefs and my father cheating on my mother.,"title: Griefs and my father cheating on my mother.
author: Ordinary_Boats
text body: Hello I hope you re doing well Here s the situation I m 25 F I m writing to you because I ve been through a lot in the past few months and I need to talk about it On January 21st my maternal grandfather passed away from cardiac arrest at 68 years old It was my first time experiencing grief and I took it very badly Then on March 20th my maternal grandmother passed away as well from a stroke at 70 years old It was another huge shock Then on April 19th a week after my birthday my paternal grandmother passed away Her death was more expected because she had been suffering from Alzheimer s for over ten years and had been in a nursing home for eight years She hadn t recognized us for a long time but she was the grandmother I was closest to and losing her really shook me What made it even harder was that we had to wait ten days before the funeral because of the crematorium and church availability Those ten days felt so long and painful On top of all that there were big problems with my father s family They criticized my sister and me insulted us for no valid reason For example they reject my sister 31 F because she s a lawyer saying that lawyers defend criminals and that it s not a respectable profession As for me I m studying to become a legal assistant and that s not acceptable to them either because I m still in the law From what I ve heard it s actually my cousin 29 F who s causing problems It s extremely hard to deal with grief while also having family members who don t respect you For example we had all chosen songs for my grandmother s funeral but the two songs my sister and I had picked were removed from the ceremony On top of all this my parents argue all the time They haven t loved each other for a long time and should have divorced already My father M 56 blames my mother F 61 for not being there for him during his grief but he himself wasn t there for my mother s losses earlier this year and in March They constantly criticize and fight unable to support each other During those ten days my father s family who had come from Lyon and were causing problems stayed the whole time My father insisted we see them because for him that side of the family came before the four of us my sister my mother him and me It was such a tough ordeal and everyone suffered But today I also found out something else I looked at my father s phone because I had a bad feeling and I discovered that he s cheating on my mother This isn t the first time when I was 15 he was already contacting escorts I told my mother back then He swore they were just messages that he never went any further but I didn t believe him because I had already caught him before without saying anything When I exposed him it caused huge fights and my mother never trusted him again He still holds it against me today for telling the truth blaming me for looking at his phone and for talking about it as if it were my fault Recently while we were staying at our vacation home to try and recover from everything I saw messages where he invited someone to come over with winking emojis and very suggestive messages He had renamed the contact St Yriex which is the city she lives in and deleted their conversations My sister also found out things when she went to pick up a package at Sephora they gave her a parcel my father had ordered a perfume that wasn t for my mother or for me or for my sister He took the package but we ve never seen that perfume at home and my sister is convinced he gave it to someone else She also told me that when I was younger she had once caught him sending heart emojis to another woman and had confronted him about it This behavior has been going on for a long time My sister says she doesn t know what to do On one hand if I tell she thinks my mother will stay anyway that nothing will change and that I ll just get yelled at again She says it s their responsibility not ours But on the other hand I m struggling with the fact that my mother keeps calling him affectionate names pretending in front of others while at home they re always fighting and saying they hate each other I still live with them while I finish my studies because I can t afford to move out so it s really hard to distance myself from all this My mother doesn t know anything It s also important to know that my mother is visually impaired so she can t see she can t know who my father is talking to I feel like my father is kind of taking advantage of her disability So should I add this revelation to everything we re already going through with all the grief Are we ready for that I really don t know I just needed an outside opinion from someone who doesn t know my father my mother my sister or me It s really weighing on me to act like nothing s happening Thank you for taking the time to read this Wishing you a very good day or evening Sorry if my English is not good it s not my first language TL DR Should I tell my mom that my father is cheating on her when will already experienced 3 griefs this year in less than 4 months",25.0,female,daughter,20-29

At a cross roads right now- long post sorry,"title: At a cross roads right now- long post sorry
author: FixRevolutionary7646
text body: Hi everyone I need an outside perspective on a lifetime long issue I will try to summarize everything to the best that I could remember for some of it But most of it has only come to light recently so I apologize if there s any missing details So in the past year I feel like I ve been broken down by my family dynamic Mainly with my father and a little bit with my mother For background I am 23 M yro with 3 siblings My eldest brother who ll be called John 30 my twin sister who I will call Mary and the youngest brother 17 who will be called Bob John recently got married to a great woman who I will call Nancy my father is a pastor from the southern United States Baptist camp and I ve been in church nearly my entire life I lived with my parents even in my adult years since there is no housing available in my price range I also am in the army as a part time reservist So this isn t the first time that something like this has happened even though I do not remember much Around my second grade year my mother and father had lived separately for a time and my mother lived with her mother and all of the children lived with my dad All I remember is that it was weird having Mom absence and Living with Dad was strict There was also a time in my high school senior year where my dad had exposed my mother for being unfaithful and in order to make the peace everyone had to give their locations to everybody I will not pretend that I didn t have a regular childhood since I would say that my family was pretty well off financially at least well enough to where mom and dad got new cars almost every two or three years and last year they bought a house together with the hope that when all of the children got married everyone would come to their house with their children Although I really don t remember most of my childhood if I m being honest Other than I remember being more free spirited than I am now and conditioned to be the dependable hard working child Anyways growing up was a little bit difficult mainly in school and how for the longest time I was not allowed to defend myself and that I eventually became into a people please and kind of person And I mainly attribute that to how my father raised me Such as how the summer was little time for rest since he would have us work during the summer with home improvement projects that ultimately meant nothing in the end There are times where mom and dad did stick up for me such as how they had to stick up for me while I was having a rough time getting along with my boss who was scheduling me during my military time which is illegal btw and how they were able to help me when I got into a car accident in January 2023 since they had my location Fast forward to my adult years I did slowly become more and more strained with my father Well honestly say that I m still trying to live a Christian lifestyle I ve grown to know that I mainly went to church out of obligation on accounts of my father And there were plenty of times where we had plenty of fights such as I had told my father that I would drop out of college if he tried to force Mary and I to go to the same school and he yelled at me because he said that he was joking and that it was my fault for not understanding that he was joking Our fights were never really fights it was more so a one sided conversation where it was like he was spanking me but with his words And last year we probably had one of the worst fights because I was having trouble keeping my part of the house clean After he was done yelling at me I just stood there for a second thinking of what to say but I didn t wanna say yes sir but I also knew that I couldn t say what I wanted to say so I just gave a nod After that I went to my girlfriend s house and out of spite I decided to turn off my location to keep myself as detached for my dad as possible And I had actually contemplated staying the night to get away from him But I ended up going home because I knew that I couldn t stay with my girlfriend at the time I got home late and my phone had died since it was really old phone with a broken charge port And Dad had thought that I had done something wrong and that I was ignoring his calls When I told him that my phone had died he said that he didn t believe me and I showed him my dead phone On the next day we got into another really big fight where it was following a letter that I gave Dad that basically detailed how I was not still over the traumatic experience over my mom being unfaithful and that I feel less fortunate because other people seem to be able to Live their life to the fullest whereas I have to work for everything to just barely get by and then I also made the complaint that God is seemingly absence of my suffering When he read the letter he honestly ignored my feelings and said that it was my fault because I lacked direction in my life And after that massive fight I just kind of kept to myself and decided to keep my emotions to myself and try to make nice with Dad and everything but I did Fast forward a couple of months I get a phone call from my leadership saying that I have to go to Europe for active duty And I m currently in Europe now Before then I went on a vacation with John and Nancy and for once I felt free to do whatever I wanted and say whatever I wanted so I decided to talk about my issues with mom and dad And it turned out that PJ also had issues and that s my sister also had issues and that really everybody had issues with my parents When John and Nancy decided to move in together mom and dad tried to spin the narrative that Nancy had corrupted John But when John had talked to Mom Mom had decided to see the truth for what Dad has been doing And that Dad has actually been more controlling Mom and how he has been controlling some of the finances With this in mind I had already left home but Bob and Mom decided to leave Dad and Dad decided to panic and tried to get in touch with everybody and I was reluctant to talk to him at first but I had called him before going to Europe and I called him out on everything that he did from how he raised me to be a people pleaser and how he threatened to kick me out of the house And as it turns out he made that threat without consulting Mom first And since that I have not spoken to him and honestly I don t plan on it Months have passed since then and John and Nancy have made peace with dad but Bob has told me that Dad has not changed And at this point mom and dad are getting a divorce and that I m still not planning to talk to my dad right now Although not a day goes by where I have not thought of Regretting my decision to cut my dad off But I m sticking to it for now There were also times where John and I would talk about Dad and he would try to convince me to try to give Dad a chance but I m remaining firm and even making the claim that life is better without my dad since I ve been in Europe Although John has threatened to limit contact because at this point he is happily married and says that he does not wish to allow the negativity to get to him While I understand this he also made the claim that I haven t done anything to improve myself which I actually took offense to because during my time in Europe I ve been slowly progressing myself in my health physically and mentally And I ve also been into therapy as well so John telling me that I ve been doing nothing to make the situation better really made me angry to the point where I actually thought about not talking to him and cutting him off as well For a moment I actually thought about listening to him but when I reached out to Bob he tells me that Dad has been putting up a front and that dad has been trying to make nice with him but he thinks that it s all fake From using money in Easter egg hunts which we never did previously As well as seemingly taking an interest in some of the things that we weren t allowed to watch as children such as Harry Potter So right now I m a bit of a crossroads because I m going home in four months and in a perfect world I would love to stay in Europe but unfortunately it s not that simple I still want to try to have a relationship with my father but I m trying to decide whether or not a relationship with him is even possible Lest I risk ruining my mental health again and I m back to where I started And the worst thing about Dad is that as many fights and arguments since we ve had the one thing that he did is lie about Jesus He lied about the gospel and tried to make it more about legalism and adult children being subservient to their parents He used Jesus s name to push his own narrative and agenda And because of that I m still recovering from dad s wounds and I m having a hard time going back to church I want to continue to love Jesus and serve him but I m having a struggle because of having to purge dad s false teachings My mother and I are on good terms But at the same time I also can t help I feel detached from the rest of my family since I have been living the best life in Europe and I ve been able to be my own person capable of making my own decisions Which is ultimately what I ve wanted since all of this has come to light I m not really sure what to do from here but I could use some advice or if nothing else some encouragement I also want to know if I am truly wrong for not talking to my dad still and that I should give him a chance",23.0,male,sibling,20-29

text body: Hey guys I recently had somewhat of a revelation that I d like your input on For some background I m a 27M who was raised by a single mother after a bitter separation from my dad There was abuse and cheating from my dad s part and he was overall kind of scummy dealt drugs and beat my mom Despite this my mom had me and my older brother with him and they were together until I turned 3 So this is where some resentment towards my mom comes in Being a single mother meant she had to work a ton to support herself and us and there was never anytime to spend with us which sucked considering our dad was out of the picture jail So when she decided to remarry and have another kid when I was like 6 7 it felt like a slap in the face because it felt like I was being pushed to the side for this new family she wanted even though she barely had time to give us any attention It always confused me as to why she would do this and then complain constantly about never having time to do anything despite it being her decision to start another family and it created this really strange high stress environment at home that made life absolutely fucking miserable Like clockwork stepdad ended up cheating tbh I don t blame him my mom is kind of a frigid tense high stress work hard type A person who has no chill and I don t know anyone who would tolerate her a few years into the marriage she got divorced again and AGAIN decided to remarry and have another kid within less than a year of meeting someone else a few years later I was entering high school at this point I remember telling her don t you think you re moving a little too fast She said we re grown we know what we re doing She was around 40 at this point Well it was more of the same shit Constant fights and arguments High stress fraught marriage She admitted to me that she regrets getting married to him this really fucked me up and made me just hate my life and feel worthless Of course I never really understood my emotions then or how to articulate them Despite this I was a really high achieving kid in school and went off to college on scholarship but ended up dropping out after having anxiety and panic attacks which ended consuming a greater part of my 20 s which stemmed from me thinking I completely fucked up my life I m better now but upon reflection I think a lot of my anxiety came from thinking I had to follow the path Go to school get a good job to support a family find a wife get married have kids and when I couldn t have that I felt like a huge failure but I ve recently begun to think I had it all backwards and my mom was the perfect example I think her preoccupation with saving face in front of the family our family is very traditional divorce not allowed is a sin no abortion sex before without marriage frowned upon and not just being happy by herself has caused her a great deal of pain that she could have avoided if she wasn t constantly chasing this perfect family I always wished she would chill the fuck out but I now think that she was more concerned with what her family would think than what was best for us And now when I realized that I had those same preoccupations I realized I could just chill the fuck out and let them go and live my life on my own terms and not what my family thinks of me and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders But I think will I regret this What if I don t pursue building a life with someone else as aggressively now while I m still young Will I end up regretting it later when I m old Maybe my mom thought this also What do you guys think",27.0,male,son,20-29

Will show him any comments when I meet up with him All names changed Some places changed I don t need advice but feel free to comment The end of this story was 2 years ago so I feel comfortable posting it now My name is Michael I was born and grew up in the Midwestern United States in the suburbs of a small town I barely remember my parents I know my mother was from Europe and married my father after meeting him on a holiday trip The gist is that one day they were there and the next day they were gone Both snuffed out in a traffic accident when I was 10 years old I was then taken in by my uncle Mark my father s brother who lived nearby It could have been the best thing that happened to me in a bad situation But unfortunately I had to mess it up From the very first time I stepped into their home I had apparently made it my mission to make them miserable I am not going to make any excuses or offer half assed explanations Maybe I was just hurt from the loss of my own parents maybe I was just a little shit to begin with Who knows Doesn t matter I basically became the poster child of what it means to be an ungrateful brat with massive entitlement issues My uncle Mark his wife Mary and my cousin James who was 3 years older than me did everything they could to help me I lacked for nothing and thanked them by being a constant thorn in their sides I am not going to go into detail I was a bully I stole stuff and many other things My cousin James became the main target of my ire and understandably started to resent me I wish he had been more outspoken about it I would have deserved a good scolding But every time anyone tried to discipline me I simply pulled out the good old my parents passed in a traffic accident card Worked every time even though it shouldn t It all came to a close when he announced his engagement to his girlfriend Sarah I should have been happy for him Instead I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to annoy him one last time and pull out all the stops My plan was as childish as it was cruel I spread a rumor about him having been unfaithful making use of social media for my accusations to spread It caused a massive rift in their relationship and their marriage was almost cancelled Almost The last straw came during the wedding I was displeased that my original plan had not worked out and decided that I was owed compensation The cash gifts from the wedding guests were the perfect target I pocketed all of it and left the wedding Having turned 18 recently and suddenly being in possession of close to 20k turned out to be as bad a combination as you would expect I burned through it within about 10 days while ghosting everyone as not to be disturbed while enjoying my ill gotten gains I then came back home and finally got what I deserved Disappearing from the wedding and the cash gifts going missing with me made it quite easy for everyone to figure out what happened I wasn t exactly the criminal mastermind I thought I was I wasn t in fact quite ignorant During my time away James had gone full detective mode He not only had obtained proof that I had taken the money but also managed to trace back the rumors I spread about him to the social media accounts created by me He and the rest of the family confronted me upon my return and finally put their collective feet down James insisted on pressing charges I was arrested interviewed and put in jail No one in my family posted bail and honestly why would they What happened afterwards is what you would expect Criminal charges civil litigation and more I was given a court appointed lawyer who was surprisingly nice to me despite me still having an attitude After 6 months my attorney had come to an understanding with James and his lawyer I would promise to apologize to him in writing admitting everything I had done and pay back the full amount I took plus his legal expenses and all court fees In exchange I would be spared jail I accepted without hesitation already starting to realize that I had hit rock bottom After being released I moved into the spare room of the only friend I had left Carl had always been on good terms with me probably because he felt a kinship due to having lost his own parents at a young age He never enabled me never put me down never took any shit from me He was just there I was able to get a job in a warehouse with some aid from the court which would give me the possibility to start paying back what I owed It was around this time that I finally became aware of my own behavior The time I spent in jail and the legal process had already made a significant dent in my ego The time I spent working and repaying James did the rest A bit less than half a year before my 21st birthday I had made the last payment to James I was rather proud of myself mainly because I had managed to pay my dues in record time by living like beggar Carl had been a great support and even congratulated in a snarky way by commenting how proud I must be to have gotten back to zero I then decided that I could finally look to the future Both professionally and socially Both avenues would remain closed On the social side I tried to genuinely reconnect with my Mark Mary and James as well as other family members taking full responsibility for my actions I wrote emails sent messages and even wrote letters It went nowhere All three of them rebuffed my attempts blocking me wherever possible and eventually threatening me with a restraining order In a final desperate attempt to show them that I was serious I offered to leave them alone forever if they agreed to one last meeting They agreed We met in uncle Mark s home I originally suggested a neutral place but they obviously wanted the home advantage James wife was there as well but didn t speak for the entire time I started off by admitting to all my wrongdoings explaining how I wanted to make amends and offering to submit to any conditions they had I didn t make excuses didn t deflect and didn t deny that my choices were to blame for anything It didn t matter They took turns laying into me which I took without flinching knowing that I had it coming James unofficially concluded the meeting by explaining that he had decided to enforce his boundaries and preserve his peace which necessitated him to cut all contact with me for his own well being I couldn t help but admire him for it though it sounded rehearsed and more what you would hear from a trained therapist or self help book I knew it was the right thing to do and he didn t owe me jack Uncle Mark nodded in agreement and asked me to leave reiterating that they weren t my family anymore and never wanted to have anything to do with me I had no choice but to accept I stood up and stated that their decision was understandable and that they wouldn t hear from me again Then I apparently made a final mistake Before leaving I said I wished them well and hoped they would have a happy life For some reason this infuriated James to this day I have no idea why it was that in particular He charged at me and hit me in the face shouting that I should finally shut up and just get lost Uncle Mark pulled him off and while he was restraining James I made my exit I made it a couple of feet away from their house before I heard a voice call my name Uncle Mark had opened the door again and stared at me Don t ever come back Do you understand I started stammering something but he just repeated the final question louder and more furiously Do you understand I was finally able to stammer a faint Yes Uncle Mark then closed the door and I kept walking Professionally it turned out just as bad Small towns are exactly what you would expect them to be Close knit and interconnected Everyone is tied to everyone else Be it through family ties business contracts church groups and similar The warehouse job I had gotten was unbeknownst to me the only job I could have gotten to begin with It was run by an old recluse who didn t care about anyone and anything perfectly inoculated from what the rest of the town said did or thought Unsurprisingly it was impossible to find any other employment of make significant moves No matter where I applied the answer was always an immediate rejection The closest I came was the office of an accountant at the very outskirts who was actually willing to employ me even offering to train me I was exhilarated already imagining a future where I could make a living as an accountant myself I was also dumb enough to mention it in one of my rare interactions with people when grocery shopping James wasted no time after learning about it and contacted the accountant s office raging about how employing me would backfire on them The guy running the office told me how James had unloaded everything he thought and threatened to badmouth them everywhere if I was given the job The offer of employment was rescinded shortly after I still couldn t get mad at anyone I understood why they did it but it didn t change the fact that it left me with no choice but stay in a dead end job forever and live out my days as a hermit It was at this point that I decided to pull the plug I had one last card up my sleeve and decided it was time to use it My mother bless her heart had never given up her foreign citizenship And when I was born she had the good sense to go to a consulate and register my birth This automatically gave me her citizenship as well since the country she was from operated under law of the blood I was told this by my attorney during the aforementioned legal proceedings after he decided to go through every shred of documentation there was about me I took some days off and made my way to the nearest consulate applying for a new passport It arrived after 2 weeks Nobody knew about this Not uncle Mark not James nobody I didn t even tell Carl And this wasn t the only good news My foreign passport listed me with my mother s family name I think this was some sort of clerical error but I didn t complain essentially giving me something close to a completely new identity The country my mother was from was now my way out I had nothing left here My own choices had made sure I had no options no future and no life Furthermore the country of my mother offered an interesting way for me to integrate and take my first steps at no cost I had read up on the country All male citizens are required to do mandatory military service during which one is provided with insurance food and shelter while getting paid a regular salary It was a perfect way out All I would have to do is get there report for recruitment as any other citizen living in the country and would get a new start I stayed with the warehouse job until I had saved up around 6000 which was enough to buy a plane ticket and survive for some time When I was ready I quit my job at the warehouse sold all my remaining belongings and shut down all my social media accounts I destroyed any and all documents I could get my hands on unless I needed to take them with me The proceeds from selling my stuff went to Carl He tried to refuse stating that I had paid for rent and groceries while staying there But I insisted In the end he accepted and we went out for dinner together one last time I pondered whether I should tell him where I was going but decided against it Carl didn t ask and I took that as silent acknowledgement that we wouldn t see each other again I took a bus to the nearest available airport and bought the cheapest one way ticket I could find to my mother s homeland One day later I stepped off the plane in Western Europe In a new country with no past and a clean slate where nobody knew anything about me The next couple of months were an administrative nightmare but nothing I couldn t handle I was focused on building a new life and a new me This time with the right attitude After getting settled with the help of some social service providers I reported to the military I had started to learn the local language which came surprisingly easy to me I assume I had retained some of it from my mom imagining how she might have spoken it to me when I was little but it wasn t enough to get one of the more coveted jobs in the military I was drafted as a regular infantryman and shortly after reported for basic What followed was the most memorable and uplifting time I had until then I gained language proficiency made new friends and even had enough time to cram for some national exams Turns out I wasn t stupid and eventually even able to gain entrance into a university The military was surprisingly understanding of personal issues and the instructors and superiors would give leave and time to study as long as you did you job My new life took form and my former life slowly faded away My surroundings felt less and less alien until one day everything simply felt normal With my past slowly being lifted off of me I started to look back at my former self in a more objective manner I was better able to understand why uncle Mark and his family did what they obviously had to They were right to cut me out They were right to enforce their boundaries And as it turns out they weren t the only ones who profited from it Not only had they secured their own peace but had also given me the opportunity to move on without the need to look back Shortly before the end of my mandatory service I struggled with the idea of writing them and letting them know that I was all right But I eventually decided against it A clean cut had been made and if I wanted their lives to remain untainted and my new life to remain unburdened I needed to accept that this new me was separate from the old me After leaving the military I went straight into my studies aided by the money I had saved up during my service After finishing my degree at the age of 26 I found work through one of my old army buddies He had gone into government service and was looking for new employees I joined his office as a regular worker and managed to climb my way up to project supervisor in a bit more than 2 years The salaries here are much higher than in the US and the benefits are great At the age of 30 I was well established and had good savings I decided to cut the final tangible cord at this time and renounced my US citizenship I did it mainly for emotional reasons but it turned out to make my financials a lot easier to manage as well The first two decades of my life felt like the memories of a different person at this point My past had become history history had become a myth And that myth was now well hidden behind the fog of time I was finally living Going out having fun exploring my hobbies True satisfaction had finally set in And that s when the universe decided to throw me one final curveball As mentioned I had shut down all accounts that had anything to do with my past life and name Facebook Twitter email etc All gone And after gaining a foothold in my new country I decided to stay off There were no pictures of me anywhere No accounts What little I had was under my new name boiling down to a work email and two private emails I was still slightly on edge and wanted to make sure that no one could ever connect me to the person I once was The one exception was one of my first and since then rarely used email accounts which I simply hadn t bothered to close That account had stayed silent for over a decade not counting the occasional spam or provider notifications Until it suddenly lit up with a message It was from James We need to talk Call me All my alarm bells went off immediately I had no intention of letting my old life come back to haunt me and disturb what I had built This meant maintaining a wall of separation between me and anyone who could come after me Calling James was thus out of the question to begin with It would reveal my phone number and my current country of abode which was unacceptable Instead I wrote back stating that phone calls were absolutely out of the question and that he was free to write One day afterwards I received an answer and it was everything I was afraid of James and his wife had two kids One was a girl named Alice who was now 8 years old She was diagnosed with some sort of illness and was in need of a tissue donation James included a lot of medical terms I did not understand Tests had concluded that neither James nor his wife or any other relative was able to donate They now demanded that I get tested and donate if I happened to be a match I didn t even have to think about it I wrote back that I was very sorry about their situation but would be unable to help I explained that they had rightfully cut me off years ago and how I had accepted their decision as a well deserved consequence of my past behavior But now I had a different life which no longer had anything to do with them and thus had no intention of ever getting into contact in any way shape or form I ended the email by wishing them all the best Naturally this was too much to ask What followed were furious emails from James and Mark calling me every name in the book insisting that I had a moral obligation to help them They pointed out how this would be the golden opportunity for me to actually show my remorse and willingness to make up for my actions as I had originally offered during the last meeting we had at Mark s house It didn t faze me I responded by reminding them that my offer had been refused at the time I made it I reiterated that James Mark and the other family members had been well within their rights to enforce their boundaries and equally justified in deciding to get rid of someone as toxic as me I even admitted that I had been and still was supportive of their decision back then But at the same time this meant that the division between me and them had been final and irreversible All parties involved which necessarily had to include me were given a fresh start and a new beginning Accordingly by paying back what I was owed in monetary terms and walking away when commanded to do so I had been released from any remaining real or metaphysical debt Something they had implicitly agreed to even if they hadn t realized it at the time I ended by reminding Mark that he specifically told me never to come back and repeating that I considered my old life to be over and having no intention of poisoning my new reality by reconnecting with anyone or anything from back then I again expressed my regret over their situation and kindly asked them to leave me alone Again they seemed to completely miss the point For the next week my old email account was flooded This time not only by James and Mark Mary and even James wife were chiming in with occasional emails from others I didn t know where to place All messages were alternating between anger guilt tripping and outright commands for me to comply I ignored them all but didn t shut the account down just yet though I should have done after responding to the first email Their outbursts might have worked on the old me But that wasn t the person they were writing to Instead I started to block people one by one after sending each of them a final message saying I will not be spoken to in this tone of voice Eventually only James and Mark were left with me honestly thinking we could simply part as equals with no hard feelings Unfortunately they had different plans I reached my limit when they started demanding that I tell them where I live to hand over a phone number so they can call me and insisting on a face to face meeting I am not going to lie This scared the hell out of me If they were this unreasonable and insistent with one email account at their disposal there was no way to tell what they would do if they were given more avenues to get to me My current social and professional circle my whole life was completely separated from my past And I knew I had to make sure it stayed that way I sent out a final email to Mark and James simultaneously I reiterated that I had no intention of violating the boundaries they themselves had set up Not just for them but for all our sakes I again expressed my sorrow about their situation and wished them all the best for the future ending in another plea to leave me alone and pursue other avenues to remedy their problem I then deleted the email account After that I decided to make sure that I was safe I started to monitor their online activities Luckily their profiles were all public which made it easier to get ahead of anything they might come up with I was relieved when it became clear that no actions on my part would be necessary They had started to post about how they needed to find me how it was a matter of survibal tagging everyone they could think of Anything would apparently be helpful to them They wanted information on where I worked where I lived who my friends were They posted old photos of me asking for them to be circulated But the nature of their posts and the way they tagged people and organizations showed that they were operating under extremely misguided assumptions They were obviously under the impression that I was still close by Really close by As in the same county or state They hadn t the slightest idea that we were separated by an ocean That I wasn t even a citizen of the US anymore Or that I had a completely new family name Their profiles furthermore contained links to a donation site asking for money to keep up with expenses during Alice s treatment They also asked for people to get tested voluntarily hoping to find a donor match It was good to see that at least some of their efforts were going towards a productive use of social media instead of incessantly focusing on me A look at the donation site showed that it was going well and I even decided to make a somewhat significant contribution myself Though I made it through a colleague under the pretense that I didn t know how to use the site paying him back through a bank transfer I kept watching for 2 months just to make sure I didn t miss anything I know this shouldn t be something to laugh at but sometimes I had to chuckle Nutjobs were commenting on how they had seen me in various places in my old home town the state and even other places in the US Some offering to follow me if they came across me again these people are seriously deranged They once zoned in on a homeless shelter in a neighboring town where some poor guy had apparently somewhat similar features to me Based on what I could dig up online they actually drove there made a fuss and scared the living daylights out of the dude by pressuring him to prove that he wasn t me Police got involved and they only backed off after it became clear that they had harassed some random sap The comments sometimes got quite sinister Allegedly retired police officers gave tips on how to lure me out by reporting me missing filing random criminal charges against me and similar shenanigans There were even shady looking private investigators offering to find me for the right price It was a relief to see that their best ideas wouldn t have a snowball s chance in hell of even getting close to me I did feel sorry Alice but reminded myself that it wasn t within my power to do anything That might have fallen within the responsibility of the person I once was But that person had ceased to exist a long time ago And honestly that is a good thing After being satisfied that I was safe I closed down the account I had used to monitor them as well which felt like putting an end to this unwelcome visit from the past once and for all The only possible loose end was that I had renounced my US citizenship in the country I lived in now meaning that the US consulate technically knew my new name and citizenship I know I was probably being paranoid but I called the US consulate nevertheless and asked some questions that wouldn t raise suspicion After the call I knew that this avenue of investigation would be a dead end as well assuming they even got that far Everything was thus in order Over half a year has passed since then and I am at peace I don t know what happened to James or Alice and I doubt I ever will There is no need for a stranger to know about the lives of other strangers I have my job I have my friends I have my life And most of all I have my own boundaries which I will not allow to be breached As strange as it sounds I will always be grateful to uncle Mark and his family for setting those borders up when I didn t even knew I needed them myself They ensured not only their own peace but also secured my own future in the process By forcing me to face my own shortcomings without their enabling they set me on a new path A path I didn t mess up like the last one Mark Mary and especially James certainly didn t deserve what I did to them They were thus right to make me pay for my transgressions They were justified in cutting ties It is fully understandable that they doubted my sincerity to make up for my mistakes and finally change I would have doubted myself back then as well Anyone would have Instead they were kind enough to demand a very small price Full separation I paid it and did so gladly Which is why I can now move forward without the need to look back I am now 32 years old My birthday was a couple of weeks ago I celebrated with my girlfriend Nina I met her at work She is 28 a data entry specialist and into sci fi as much as I am friends from the office old army buddies and other people I met during my time here People who only know the me I am now I rented out a rooftop venue which was quickly filled with laughter music and conversation During the evening my former CO came over and complimented me on something strange Said he remembered how bad my local language was when he met me during basic But now he wouldn t be able to tell me from a native speaker For some weird reason that stuck with me It was as if I had managed to overcome some final hurdle that completed a journey I wasn t even aware I was on After the celebrations had ended me and my girlfriend got ready to return to our apartment I stared back at the venue before walking into the staircase prompting Nina to ask me whether I had forgotten something I answered honestly Nope Nothing important If anyone reads this Just know that it is never too late to change Never too late to start something new I wish you all the best",32.0,male,nephew,30-39

My brother is a professionally trained psychological manipulator,"title: My brother is a professionally trained psychological manipulator

text body: I ve been dealing with a long standing family conflict and at this point I m afraid it might be a lost cause I F late 20s have an older brother early 30s who has always been problematic Growing up he mastered the art of instigating people and as he got older he pursued psychology and neuroscience At one point he was even a PhD candidate but he never graduated I believe his major issues escalated in 2020 when he threatened a woman on Twitter She exposed him to his school professors and colleagues and others came forward with allegations of verbal and physical threats destruction of property assault and even stalking It s unclear if he s been in school since then though he s repeatedly told me and my dad that he has constantly moving the goalpost on his supposed graduation date for the past five years A few months after the Twitter incident he lost his apartment and moved back in with our dad 60 at our childhood home Within weeks he started having frightening arguments with our dad blaming him for his failures making threats and damaging property breaking doors punching walls throwing things Sometimes in the middle of these blowups he d call me despite me living five hours away by car and find a way to blame me for whatever had set him off that day Then three months in things escalated My brother texted my dad threatening to kill him Right after he called me to apologize for what he was about to do I immediately hung up and called my dad who seemed unfazed until my brother started kicking down his door That s when I called the police They removed him from the house and warned that if he returned he d be charged with trespassing That s when the guilt trips began He d text us saying he was staying at a homeless shelter and had witnessed something horrific He d bring up our mom who passed from cancer in 2007 saying she d be rolling in her grave over how we treated him He dug into my past throwing painful memories in my face even telling me to end my own life that the people I love would be better off without me Thank God I had already done the work on myself because if I d heard that 10 years ago I don t know if I would have made it About a month later my dad caved and let him move back in And so the cycle repeated Over the past four years he has continued his destructive behavior He has verbally attacked my boyfriend who I plan to marry with racist remarks He twists anything personal I ve ever shared with him into a weapon On top of all this my brother hasn t worked in years He s fully able bodied but has been unable to hold down a job and is living on welfare Yet instead of using that as an opportunity to get his life together he continues to be a toxic force in our home What makes this even more ironic is that my brother has always been an advocate for mental health and is highly educated in addiction He frequently talks about the dangers of substance abuse yet he has recreationally used marijuana for years and has dabbled in mushrooms and other substances In May 2024 my boyfriend of 4 years and I visited my dad for his 60th birthday My brother gave us the silent treatment but otherwise we had a great trip When I visited again in November things seemed better My brother and I actually had a decent conversation until out of nowhere he casually offered me hard drugs I brushed it off and went to bed The next day things took a dark turn While getting ready for a friend s birthday dinner I gave my dad a few marijuana edibles to try they re legal where we are That s when my brother flipped He accused me of trying to kill our father I tried to reason with him but he began berating me screaming that I was a f ing woke tranny piece of shit For the record I m a cis woman but that s beside the point He then told me to get the f out of his house At that moment I no longer felt safe I decided to grab my things go to dinner and find somewhere else to stay for the night As I was leaving he grabbed my hair yanked me to the floor and we struggled I managed to get up and call the police Here s the kicker while I was giving my statement the officers felt the need to tell me how well educated my brother is As if his past studies in psychology and neuroscience somehow excused his violent behavior No charges were filed because there were no witnesses and no serious bodily harm That night he sent me a barrage of vile texts I blocked him And I told myself Enough I thought cutting him off would bring relief It didn t The real issue is my dad He can t bring himself to cut my brother off I understand no parent wants to see their child on the streets but things cannot continue like this It s been six months since I last saw or spoke to my brother and unless he makes serious changes and acknowledges the harm he s caused I want nothing to do with him Recently my dad confided in me about what s been happening My brother has been stealing marijuana alcohol prescription meds anything with street value I m terrified for my dad It feels like I m watching a slow motion horror movie except it s my life",29.0,female,sibling,20-29

text body: Im 22m living with my mother and recently she s feeling stressed due to some payments for my grandfather s funeral costs different county so not sure how it works and is essentially putting the trust in my 3rd brother we re 4 to make the payments Some background she managed to bring all of them from their home country to the US by the time I became 14 The 3rd brother John was here the shortest amount of time only like 8 9 months and left for 2 reasons 1 because he was tired of the American Dream and 2 he wanted to be with some girl they separated shortly after though My mother was devastated and depressed but thankfully recovered through faith My eldest brother Mike would leave a bit after to pursue his education back home Keep in mind both left with a big amount of cash back home only Mike was smart enough to leave it to our mom to gradually send it back The 2nd oldest Steve is the black sheep so you know the rebellious type and did his own thing but is still here in the US So years later John met someone else has a daughter and a son on the way Mike managed to finish his equivalence of a GED and is a supervisor at some company and has a spouse no kid and as for Steve he s met someone has 3 kids and a stepson But I want to mention except for Mike the ways they met their spouses weren t on purpose they kinda just went with the flow and played around Funny when I write this since it sounds like they re the youngest but they were like mid late 20s when they had their first kids So lets get to the topic my gramps passed away this past January he was living with John who was taking care of him in his final days he has a big attachment as he took care of John as a boy when our mother was in the US working to brig them and from what I heard my mother also uncle aunt has to pay a monthly cost back to their home country for where he is buried John volunteered to go to the office to make the payments all was well until recently My mother received a payment of an overdue bill for the month of March but John sent us a receipt of the payment 1 day late so we assumed that it was the office s protocol to send that notice out In between this time he would ask for some to help out around the home his daughter robbed phone etc But it would be strange that he wouldn t tell us what exactly he did with the money and would emphasize speaking with him on serious matters not even his spouse ok gal better compared to Steve s And as there s nobody who can confirm at the office since he recently had his phone stolen my mom s been on edge But what I always found odd was the way he would ask for not like expecting money but always having an issue where he s short on cash And our mom being sympathetic for her grandbaby would send something hell even I did the first few times But when he called me personally about sending a larger amount but without mom knowing is when I realized he s taking it too far After that he stopped with the casual calls to ask how I was doing and went back to talking solely to mom I mean I never said anything rude but I was upfront that the amount he was asking would make me go broke college so yeah I d say he doesn t truly realize the effort of making cash as he was in the country for less than a year while my other 2 brothers we here 7 years So he managed to get a new phone but hasn t checked in with our mom his spouse told us and as I said my mom is stressed about it because if the contract is broken the company will have to remove the casket from where its buried till a new contract is made I don t think any of yall would want to be in a situation with yalls parents like this And all of this situation is making me tense as I m concerned for her health",22.0,male,son,20-29

text body: So my older brother has always been a hyper masculine and aggressive individual and he s recently become infatuated with conspiracy theories Trump and New Age enlightenment politics In a recent conversation we had some disagreement over trans rights issues I 29m tried to reason with him about the psychological weight that prejudice and bigotry carries with it and he became extremely argumentative yelling telling me to cease as I was speaking that sort of thing The next day he left pretty quickly as he was visiting at my parents place where I live He later called my parents and apologized for leaving so suddenly and explained that he could not stand to be around me because of the intense waves of energy I was sending him He compared me to a homeless meth addict implied that I was evil and said if I ever did that again I would end up on the floor clearly threatening physical violence My parents seemed bothered by this but told me not to take it too seriously and to simply be more careful about how I talk to him He definitely has a pattern of getting in arguments with family over anything but to my knowledge this is the first time he s threatened anybody physically since he was a teenager at least I am a gay man and I feel convinced that it is only a matter of time before he does act on this I tried to talk to my parents about it and I was able to get good confirmation from my dad that he would cut ties if this were to happen and my brother would no longer be welcome at the house or family gatherings etc my mom however seems totally willing to look the other way and would rather take my brothers word on how enlightened he his than critically look at his actions It s incredibly disheartening to know that it would have to get so extreme for them to even consider taking estrangement seriously but again I feel it is only a matter of time How would you deal with this situation Any advice is appreciated TL DR I m increasingly afraid of my brother who is threatening me physically parents are making excuses idk what to do",29.0,male,brother,20-29

text body: I 16F live with my grandma 69F who has temporary custody of me My dad 42M technically has full legal custody he was granted that when CPS took me away from my mom when I was about six years old because of her addiction and unsafe living conditions After that I lived with my dad in Colorado for about eight months but it was a very neglectful situation a whole different story After he divorced his then wife he basically forced my grandma to take me back and I haven t seen him in person since then It s been almost ten years We barely text he doesn t pay child support and even though he technically still has custody he s not meaningfully involved in my life at all My grandma has had temporary custody this entire time even though it s basically permanent now As for my mom she has struggled with drug addiction since her early teens When she was about 18 my grandparents forced her to go to rehab and she got sober from drugs for about nine years I was born during that sober period However even during those years she still drank heavily partied and relied on my grandparents to co parent me My grandparents felt bad for her because she was a single mother but she definitely took advantage of them Even before drugs my mom never acted like a real parent I was more like her emotional support system She would pull me close when she wanted affection and when it suited her but push me away when annoyed and or dump me on my grandparents She was extremely short tempered and disciplined me unnecessarily which even my grandparents admitted and lacked any maternal instinct It s always felt like she wanted someone to love her not someone she needed to care for Now my grandma keeps letting my mom come stay with us She justifies it because my mom goes to a methadone clinic twice a week For anyone who doesn t know methadone is supposed to help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms if someone is committed to recovery Patients are supposed to come in consistently to get their doses But if they miss days or continue using illegal drugs their methadone dose resets lower and they have to slowly work back up to a stable amount It s meant to stabilize recovery but only if someone actually stops using But my mom still leaves for days or weeks on drug binges resets her methadone dosage and gives our home address to dealers We ve had random people show up to our house delivering drugs and my grandma is well aware and OK with this Last week I finally convinced my grandma that the methadone clinic wasn t working We took my mom to the hospital to try and get her help with withdrawal symptoms However she had clearly just used drugs right before we brought her in The hospital told us they couldn t really help unless she was actively going through life threatening withdrawal like literally to the point of not breathing they couldn t treat her I ve seen my mom go through severe withdrawals before vomiting shaking barely able to function but unless she s literally dying in front of them they won t medically intervene The hospital did offer to get her into a detox center immediately I thought that was the best course of action because detox would stabilize her and actually make rehab a realistic next step But my mom refused She said she didn t want to go to detox only straight into rehab Despite knowing because I confirmed it with the staff that most rehabs require detox first and despite knowing there are long waiting lists for almost all rehabs my grandma decided to respect her wishes and refused to push her into detox She said my mom needs to want it herself and she won t force her I get that you can t force someone into recovery but it feels like just another excuse to keep enabling her That same night my grandma made a deal with my mom If my mom stayed at our house and didn t run off on another binge she wouldn t force her to go to detox and would only make her go straight to rehab instead My mom ran off the very next night after that hospital visit and she hasn t been back since Meanwhile when she s here I m stuck making rehab calls doctor appointments and letting her use my phone to contact dealers because she keeps losing hers Only in the past month or two has my grandma even refused to drive her around but she still keeps letting her stay and making excuses for her as well as paying for her drugs Whenever I try to set boundaries my grandma gets defensive and blames me She says if I didn t want my mom here I wouldn t help She brings up how when I was little I used to beg for my mom to stay even though for the past three years I ve told her to leave multiple times Everyone keeps telling me to give my grandma grace because it s her daughter I get that emotionally But I feel stuck I m tired of parenting both my mom and my grandma while they make excuses and I m the only one acting logically Even when my mom isn t here I m still emotionally regulating my grandma At the end of the day I m still just a teenager I turn 18 in two years and I m planning to move out as soon as I can because even my relationship with my grandma is complicated She has her own verbally abusive tendencies the same ones my mom experienced growing up I m just so emotionally exhausted I feel like no matter what I do I ll always be seen as the bad guy for trying to protect myself Thanks for letting me get this off my chest I would also really appreciate any advice if anyone has any",16.0,female,granddaughter,10-19

Advice Regarding my Parents and My Own Family,"title: Advice Regarding my Parents and My Own Family
author: Hachuyani2
text body: I will do my best to explain this post to the best of my ability I am the eldest son of 4 children I am almost 34 years old my First Sister is 32 my brother is 28 and my youngest sister is 25 My parents are 61 Dad and 56 Mom My first Sister and brother are both Single brother lives with parents and first sister lives in one of my parents houses Parents have 3 houses I am living in one of them My youngest sister had a baby girl born on December 30th of 2024 Toxic Boyfriend situation who isn t always there for her but she stays with him from time to time and also in First Sister s house I am the only one who is married out of my siblings my wife is almost 34 as well we are 3 months apart and we have a boy Toddler 2yrs 6mo and NEWBORN baby boy born April 6th 2025 My wife is also from another country Philippines Now that the stage is set I ll begin with my question regarding the background I love my parents but they have an extreme boomer mindset As I said before they own 3 houses and a couple other properties my dad still works and is very well financially not rich by any means but my mom has a very bougie upper class mindset For some more background my dad was very poor growing up and my mom didn t have to worry for much but they were both abused to some degree as children My dad s side was more Mental Abuse Lack of Emotional Support and my mom s was a combination of emotional and physical her dad did things that were not appropriate to do to your daughter if you can imagine it then you get the idea It is of a sexual nature between beating and touching they have done their very best and I ve done the same to have mercy and understanding with them That being said when I was young I always had a dream of what I wanted my life to be like An example of things I had to deal with would be I had a bed wetting issue years ago and my mom would say things like you re too lazy to use the bathroom and at one point made me sleep in the garage and sent me outside in the snow in a diaper at 11 years old This particular incident she DID ask forgiveness for and I did forgive her and don t hold that against her anymore this is important to reference later because outside of that she would never apologize for anything The next example was the type of wife I wanted She tried to control every friend and even the type of woman I should be with to be specific I preferred someone of an Asian Background and culture because I love the family dynamic associated with it and decided so ever since I was 16 Both her and my dad have even accused me of having Pedo like tendencies because of this I am 6ft 4in and I used to be skinny but I grew up to about 250lbs I also had a failed LDR relationship of 4 years back and forth in the Philippines but eventually met my now wife different girl but also from the Philippines and at age 30 I did marry her 2022 and now we have two beautiful children and I got her and my first son here June 7th 2024 in the USA I also didn t mention that I was married to her until after I had already married her For even more context my brother still lives at home with them and all my siblings have jobs but I digress in order to get to where I was married I forced myself out of the house right before I turned 30 went into several thousands of dollars worth of debt trying to keep my own apartment I managed for about 15 months and would have been fine didn t talk to my parents for about a year but they called me and offered me one of their houses as a very very good deal 725 mortgage and for the sake of my family I took the deal You can shame me and that is fine I am a FedEx Driver making approximately 41 46k a year but I still struggle to take care of my family I know most people may say to just deal with the parents since they have helped me financially now with this house it s a 3bd 1ba on 2 5 acres 900sq ft but my mother literally tries to control everything I do She has disrespected my wife and whilst she does enjoy seeing my toddler I gave her a chance to see our newborn but on her first meeting she was too worried about his clothes and how they weren t the ones she bought for him The inner clothes were but the jacket was from my wife s mom and now she keeps trying to feed my newborn water which she adds to goat milk and also trying to give him apple juice She has only watched him for 5 days we would take him for 4 6 hours in the evening but she insisted on watching him even though my wife and I were managing just fine albeit very tired My youngest sister allowed them to watch her baby for 2 weeks but then removed her because they wouldn t follow her rules I know most people are going to probably see the financial side of this but I enjoy spending time with my family I only work about 25 30 hours a week I am also trying to homestead for the health of my family chickens goats etc it s a lot of work and they both shame me for it but I want the best for my family My question would be this Should I cut them off entirely and start a new life I am at a crossroads where I almost want to forsake the house and move into our own new place even if it means more financial struggle I could go into more detail about my mom as she is extremely controlling and always has been but she believes the financial help entitles her to control nearly every aspect of my life This post doesn t have anywhere near the detail but I figured I d start with this",34.0,male,eldest son,30-39

text body: I 32F am not afraid to cut off family members When someone starts consistently doing more harm than good in my life especially if avoidable hurtful behaviour remains unchanged after confrontation I m done Out I ain t got time for that I ve got a big family and grew up close to most of them These days I talk to none of them except my younger brother 24M and mom With aunts uncles cousins it was just the slow disconnect that I realized was a good thing when my life got more peaceful Narcissistic paternal grandmother got the boot my golden child of a father went next and my princess of a younger sister came after that A handful of years between each cut And now my baby brother is on the chopping block and I m absolutely heartbroken because it isn t going well Here s what happened yesterday My brother sent me a meme video I was actually excited We re civil and get along but only really hang out as a group with mom and my bf for board game nights Which I always thought was pretty cute and as much as I needed but YAY let s throw memes into the mix The video was nominating me to get my driver s license I have epilepsy He knows that I don t have a driver s license for a pretty damn good reason I haven t flopped for some involuntary breakdancing in a few years hooray for that but I do still have occasional focal seizures And the way they sneak up out of nowhere I simply wouldn t feel responsible or safe behind the wheel I should also mention about him knowing I have a damn good reason When I was first diagnosed my brother and mom secretly questioned my boyfriend asking the man who s held my convulsing body on several occasions whether or not I was faking it I honestly don t know why I let that incident slide It endlessly bothers me that they think so little of me That they think I would lie about that Anyways when I watched the little nomination clip I got enraged And devastated A swirl of negative emotions that definitely had me crying the more I thought about how he just straight up overlooked my entire disability and everything I fucking struggle with Yeah haha she can t drive So funny how she needs a ride to work or to get groceries or any kind of appointment So funny how she can t function independently Point and laugh I messaged some friends about it and they made me feel sane about being angry my family likes to say I m sensitive or over dramatic but adulthood slowly showed me that I m just a human with normal emotions and expressing those emotions makes my family uncomfortable It s a really fun dynamic Anyways after messaging friends I sat with my feelings for a bit to let me process a minute and get a level head Once there I wrote my response in my memos and sat on that a bit Edited once or twice I wanted it to almost be an emotionless expression of my hurt feelings My sadness or anger weren t going to be in the driver s seat this time It basically said that while I know that was supposed to be funny it hurt my feelings and I feel like my struggles were overlooked for a cheap laugh at my expense I waited 3 hours to send it Through those 3 hours I had an absolute meltdown while overthinking My precious baby brother has become quite the gymbro over the past few years and I was terrified that it d gone past the muscles and into the personality Actually I knew it already had Recently learned he doesn t fucking respect women which made me overthink more I was ranting to friends who I love for letting me talk their ears off yesterday that I was petrified of him responding you re too sensitive Sent that shit on the 3 hour mark and maybe 20 minutes later I got the reply it s not that deep I messaged back yes it is and completely fucking broke down Not only did he hurt my feelings but he didn t care Like at all I don t even care about the video anymore I care that he didn t care to apologize He hasn t sent a message back yet and it s been almost 20 hours I don t think he s going to I m contemplating messaging him again but I m not sure how to do it without making a bigger mess I just want to ask why he doesn t seem to care that he genuinely hurt my feelings yesterday It s not about how big of a deal he thinks it is He wasn t the one targeted by the joke The lack of empathy is so fucked And I feel guilty too I feel like it s my fault he ended up this way When I moved for college our communication got a lot less I should have kept it up even with everything else happening in my life I should have been a better big sister to help him make better choices and friends Because I fuckin know our family wouldn t have taught him anything fucking useful They re emotionally fucking stupid and nasty and lack empathy and tact and Jesus Christ I m just so mad at everything I don t know what to do My bf is super mad which also sucks because he and my brother are pretty close We had a brother who died just before my bf came into the picture and my bf kind of effortlessly became that big brother influence that we had lost And my bf is ready to completely drop him for my sake I love that I have a man who would do that Who actually puts me first But I hate that it s going to steal something so necessary from my brother It s going to I have no doubts after yesterday My baby brother has turned into everything he always claimed to hate I don t want to compare him to our fucking dad but God damn it Mkay now I m crying so I m gonna stop or else this is gonna become gibberish Thanks for letting me rant this morning",32.0,female,sister,30-39

author: Ok_Phrase4779
text body: Hello Reddit I have been struggling on and off with my parents for most of my adult life As much as journaling constantly about my gripes and sorrows to myself I d like some feedback from others Maybe connect with people who are going through similar experiences Sorry for the length it all had to come out The Backstory Myself now mid 30 s Male have divorced parents they unfortunately waited until I was in my early 20 s to divorce I experienced a full childhood of screaming swearing yelling slamming and breaking things emotional manipulation from my mother and physical abuse from my father My mom ruled with guilt and embarrassment as her tools of the parenting trade She would host small get togethers all the time and embarrass me constantly by revealing very personal things about me or things that I did as a child This would happen in front of the entire group while I was present It was a constant habit Sometimes her guests would directly tell her that it wasn t nice appropriate right after she said it and she would pretend to act sorry and surprised like she didn t know what she did If she wanted things done Guilt Always a guilt trip Everything My father was silent until he wasn t A real MOAB type He would sit in his recliner after work with a stack of beers and watch Star trek You could never get his attention On the rare occasion that i dared get his attention I would just yell DAD right infant of his face and it couldn t budge his attention When it was finally time for his bi weekly twice a week blowout you could guarantee the entire neighborhood knew what was happening And occasionally the local PD It would start with questions accusations of something that was said done not done touched or broken After a few minutes when he didn t get the answered he was expecting there was always the typical slap across the face to start it all off It was always by surprise my guess was on purpose once you released it was coming it had already happened Things would always escalate The yelling was always ear piercing The comments were always degrading Kids are little shits when you have kids that s all you have Worthless Ungrateful As I got older Cocksucker Little Fucker The list goes on Hard to remember when you re getting held against the wall by your throat not being able to reach the floor Or being punched in the face held down on the bed hair being pulled and being dragged The Now Myself still mid 30 s male twice Married two children First wife left me for another man A true hallmark blessing after a totally garbage marriage that happened too young She ended up with someone 5 times as worse as myself at that time That divorce allowed me to figure out what this shell has inside of it I gained confidence for the first time Knew who I was and what I was about Found the love of my life who I had known most of my adult life already I m very happy and content with my immediate life and family The ones under my roof To be honest I never get the urge to reach out to my family I feel guilty for not feeling anything towards either of them like it s my fault I feel like I still downplay the abuse I endured as a kid It s wild to write out even a fraction of it and still be like damn My relationship with my parents is still strained My mom tries to pretend she loves me and her grandkids My father either completely refuses to acknowledge any terrible things he did or brags in front of people that his beatings really got his kids in line My Mom lives for the public image of herself Attention is her drug and Facebook is her paraphernalia She jumps from female partner to female partner She lets them spoil her rotten and does nothing from them in return When the wow effect of her LGBTQ lifestyle wears off she moves on to another She see s her grandchildren very seldom maybe 4 times a year Never asks about them But has no issue spending time and posting pictures of other peoples children or her nieces nephews all over Facebook You know Family stuff I ve brought up her behavior countless times We ve had plenty of blowouts and periods of not talking Nothing changes She ll try for a few days but she genuinely just isn t interested And I find it almost impossible to try on my end I ve just got nothing to give honestly Despite living 10 minutes away she NEVER comes by When she does it s brief An hour max She s always got social obligations On the rare occasion she watches the kids she s ready to give them back the second I drop them off There s just nothing to build off of My Dad has tamed down quite a bit since the divorce When my mom left I was the one there quite literally picking him off the floor He emptied the house of pretty much everything He refused to celebrate holidays for a while I would buy him a Christmas tree and set it up for him to surprise him and he would just act irritated He finally started getting better over the course of a couple of years I would always be over there spending time with him doing things for him He suddenly ALWAYS talked about grandkids Obsessed with the thought and excitement of potentially having them someday And all the things he would do with them He then met his now wife who came with a whole entire family Expanding on that later My first wife had gotten pregnant at this time We shared the exciting news with him and received a very disappointing reaction Oh cool he says Come to find out my now stepsister had JUST had a baby boy She was completely reliant on her mom doing and paying for everything for her A real leech type My dad had been taking this boy to doctors appointments shopping you name it they were doing it together My little buddy he would say right in front of me as I hold his only granddaughter in my arms Who he still has NEVER watched once or done anything with I still feel that disappointment to the day A couple years later I gave him his first ACTUAL grandson And my step sister has given him another grandson by marriage around the same time He spends a crazy amount of time with the two of them while his actual grandkids see him 3 times a year maybe Also only lives 15 minutes away I know this is forever long and I will try to wrap it here But I feel like some backstory is important I m trying to find a way to let the resentment go but it s literally the only thing I have The only thing I have control of I feel like both my parents have lost their minds Or never had them I don t think my father has the mental capacity to be capable of self reflection I think he genuinely doesn t think anything about his actions then and now Not in a mean way he s just a simple man And was also very abused by his military father I don t want to continue on giving my parents the satisfaction of showing up for rare family events and answering nothing but question text messages I think ideally l d just like to let go of that connection or the placeholder for the connection It s my opinion that your blood family should take some sort of precedence over the family you married into Been with his wife for about 5 years Not to say he shouldn t be doing anything with his other grandkids by marriage But if my grandkids aren t getting ANY involvement neither should they His new family is definitely top priority And his step children are so dependent on them financially childcare and just all around help with life that they and their children are ALWAYS at his house My mom is a lost cause I m irritated with her fakeness her lack of involvement and her inability to settle down and sit still for more than 10 minutes I don t know if there s anything to rebuild there I think I m mostly just bothered by the injustice of it all and not the actual lack of relationship on either side Maybe someone will find this interesting or relatable Or want to share their similar experiences I don t know just wanted to get it out there TL DR Parents abusive during Childhood Now parents have a new life and are totally uninvolved with their grandkids and myself but spend plenty of time with literally anyone else",35.0,male,son,30-39

Sister possibly schizophrenic??,"title: Sister possibly schizophrenic??
author: oofwoofyikes
text body: Hello So I recently removed myself from my family as of January 2024 Long story short my father is a racist homophobic fascist and wouldn t accept my relationship and I can t bring myself to stick around someone who doesn t support my happiness due to their hatred and my mother has been abusing pain pills since I was 15 and between the addiction and mental health issues she had underlying I was over being abused by her My sister 28F who also uses pain pills had been in car accident in 2018 and messed up her leg which is why she started but also I presume shared mutual habit of her and my mother and I 25F had a falling out shortly after that year as she kept trying to get me to reconnect with my parents and I had asked her to please respect my boundaries and stop asking for that She had freaked out on me and ended up blocking me for doing so before I could even respond really In September she had reached out and apologized and she has been pretty okay with boundaries regarding my parents since However in the time that we were not speaking she had met a man at work for context she is a stripper and has been for years even before the car accident was told to stop dancing by doctors bc knee would get worse and it has who was here from Russia on a work visa My sister had told me that they fell for each other very quickly and even through the language barrier he was treating her better than she had ever been treated In what she was describing of him it seemed like he just wasn t abusing her which had happened in a lot of relationships in the past so while I was happy that hadn t been happening I wasn t impressed by him yet Anyways by August they were married Everything seemed to be going okay from what I was hearing up until about a month ago Now from the brief 2 times that I had been around him I wasn t fond of her new husband but I thought I could just be being protective and this random man who my sister didn t know 6 months ago is now legally attached to her And I also must add in here that my sister and I are very spiritual people not religiously but when it comes to the universe and divinity and the law of attraction astrology and numerology and things like that we re pretty involved I find it interesting and practice when I can however my sister lets a coin flip make most of her decisions saying her spirit guides control the coin It s a little trivial but she swears by it and I ve just kind of been like oh okay cool While I do believe in clairvoyance and clairsentience and things of that matter and even having spiritual visions come to you my sister has pushed it as far as her spiritual downloads telling her she is the reincarnation of both Beethoven and after him Kurt Cobain and now herself Okay so my concern now is my most recent conversation with her She came over my apartment on my lunch break I work from home and I had known already that things with her new husband have been a little off lately through a previous FaceTime call but she couldn t give me details because he was there But immediately when I asked what was going on she said well I m the terminator and he s gonna have to go down because I won t let him ruin the world I asked okay I m a little confused can you explain And she had said that she thought her spiritual downloads when she had met this man was to marry him so that he would be saved from the war that is coming between his country and ours but now knows through her downloads that he was actually pre determined to be a dictator in the war and that she has to stay married to him in order to keep him from going back to make sure he doesn t lead to the demise of the earth as we know it essentially Had gone into politics a little there and said that her husbands astrology matched what would be a stronger dictator than Putin idk if I m gonna get flagged for every saying all of this it makes me kind of nervous Anyways I redirected and asked her about his issues with her job something she had mentioned on the phone prior He now has an issue with her stripping accuses her of being unfaithful which is red flag to me anyways because he knew what she did for work when they met He also has an issue with her and her pain pills and personally I agree with him on this as I really do not like that she takes them But she is taking it as an attack because she is much more functioning than our mother and refuses to admit that she is still an addict whether she s better than our mother or not Regardless he is suddenly very disproving of her life overall and she said the more English he understands and the more Russian she understands the less they understand each other I asked her if she has talked to her therapist about this and she said she doesn t speak to her therapist about her husband because she does therapy virtually and she is nervous he will hear her talking about him since he now understands more of what she is saying And yes I confirmed with her multiple times that she does not feel like he is a danger or threat to her physically To me it sounds like she s realizing she may have made a mistake rushing into this marriage for whatever reason and putting this narrative on it is helping her push off accountability for that mistake I had told my boyfriend about her downloads regarding his dictatorship and he brought up that while it s kind of funny it s also really scary that she believes this Like bordering possible schizophrenia She has told me before she will spend days awake at a time because that sleep schedule works for her and on her third day of being awake she gets most of her downloads But my boyfriend had said this really is an estranged thought of her to have and it might be smart to notify someone about this I don t know WHAT to do honestly or who to notify Whenever I go against anything she says even in an opinion way she gets super defensive still I feel like that was a lot so thank you for getting to the end if you did and I can answer any questions for anything that I may not have made clear",25.0,female,sister,20-29

I ve done nothing but try and be kind but she clearly dislikes the both of us To give you an idea of what the past few years have been like She announced her pregnancy to the family the week we got engaged yet I wasn t supposed to be told because I wasn t family husband then fiance said f k that told me anyway and I just didn t say anything When I was allowed to know I expressed my excitement and offered to babysit She told me I would never be allowed to babysit as I have no qualifications for watching children despite the fact I m a teacher She informed me the whole family thought him marrying me was a mistake because we met on eharmony and had only been dating a year before we got engaged I m banned from taking pictures with my niece and anytime I m with her she watches me like a hawk as if I m a corrupting influence or might hurt her My husband s sister 31F let s call her Amanda and I were close for a while but she has gotten more and more distant since getting married last year Side note She met her husband on Bumble but that was perfectly acceptable apparently I was a bridesmaid went to the bridal shower and bachelorette party and we used to hang out now and then She and Kylie have always been closer but Kylie and the brother have been together on and off since high school so I always assumed it was because they ve known each other longer Amanda recently announced her own pregnancy Despite the fact my husband and I have been struggling to conceive for five years and are currently going through IVF we expressed nothing but joy for her news Yet she has decreed that we are devastated and resentful Of course it hurts hearing yet another couple has been successful where we haven t but that doesn t mean we aren t happy for her nor would we ever wish our struggle on someone else I have spoken with her many times long before her marriage and pregnancy that it is difficult juggling the excitement for another and your own pain envy but we agreed both emotions are valid and can be felt simultaneously At this point I m well versed in that juggle as almost all of my friends and at least one coworker each year has been pregnant in the years we have been trying The night before I went in for the blood test to see if our transfer worked Amanda sent out her gender reveal invitation I immediately RSVP d with the comment so excited Unfortunately our transfer was unsuccessful I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say it would have been more cruel to send the invite after we got that news but it s hard to understand why that was the time to send that out And yes even though she never reached out she knew we would find out the next day Neither of them reached out to check on me or my husband once we got the news which also hurt but again trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as I know most people just don t know what to say Saturday was our niece s birthday party Through miscommunication we were late arriving but still in the window of the party time No one acknowledged our arrival except my husband s parents and Amanda did not speak to or look at us the entirety of the time we were there If his mom asked us a question to bring us into the conversation the topic was immediately changed While we managed to engage my brothers in law in some conversation it was abundantly clear our presence was unwanted After eating Kylie and Amanda took my niece to another area far away from us They loudly discussed all the times they hang out together we ve never been invited and started talking about Easter plans again we hadn t been invited While we do not actively attend church nor are we religious we always celebrate the big holidays out of respect so the lack of invitation was purposeful Frustrated and uncomfortable my husband wanted to leave as soon as possible so we took my niece inside to give her presents As she was opening her card Kylie rushed in and immediately tried to usher her back outside Luckily our niece was more invested in opening her gifts and refused The moment she was done however Kylie hurried her outside I apologized for being late saying we spoke to her husband the night before and got a different time than the invitation She said You got the invitation and it clearly said 1 We went to leave and the only ones the say goodbye were his parents and our niece Everyone else ignored us This is only the most recent fraction of the story but the general theme is the same My husband has been ready to cut them off for awhile but I keep trying to engage because I think family is important He s also dealt with some mental health struggles related to body image and our struggle with infertility and I hoped his family would be a source of comfort and support I wrote up long texts to Amanda and his brother but left them unsent because I feel like there s no point I don t see them admitting any guilt or apologizing nor do I feel like anything I can do will change their behavior Do I try to make things right or just give up",34.0,female,sister-in-law,30-39

text body: My mother is manipulative and a micro manager She is only with my father for his money My father is now 82 and my mother is now 56 I m a 26 year old man now and for my entire childhood I was emotionally abused I am still massively affected by it I spent my entire childhood scared and withdrawn with no friends and only able to leave the house with them or for school Writing this is one of the hardest things i ve ever done as I have never been able to put into words what she would do It didn t matter what the situation was she could manipulate it so she was a hero saviour victim amazing mother E T C Anything that would benefit her in that situation So despite living in fear nobody could ever see it They all just belittled me and told me my mother was amazing and that I should be more grateful Even if I brought up what she would do I could never put it into words or it was all so small that it seemed like nothing to them Some examples of things she would do Up until the age of 18 she would check on me in the shower bath and insisted on helping me bathe She used to force me to kiss her on the lips and would get hysterical if I didn t She used to accuse me of taking drugs if I even sprayed aftershave she d tell the family I was inhaling it She would make me ask her permission to use aftershave or roll on deodorant that she then stored in her office under lock and key She controlled what I ate down to having the same breakfast for months at a time even though I hated it She would check on me while I was asleep up until 18 When I started having my now wife currently 26F at the time we were both 16 round she would listen outside the door and made me ask her every time I needed a condom She used to lie pathologically about the most random things for example seeing friends behind my father s back making me lie too And telling me my father would hate me and divorce her That she would make it so I never saw him again Silent treatment blowing up in my face financial control she had her time and her days with me which meant even if I had plans I had to spend it with her She would make me out as a really ungrateful waste of space and that she is a wounded victim to make her seem amazing infront of others She would talk about all the stuff she bought on credit cards and get my father to pay off for me to make her seem like an amazing person She would also spend money lavishly on others to boost there opinion of her When my father made me the heir to his will he announced it infront of others She smiled and made out that it was what she wanted then took me aside and said if he dies and that will goes through I will sue you for every penny you get I haven t satisfied him for 26 years for you to get it all This has now been amended in that will she was still entitled to live in the house till she dies rent free and a large sum of money She would admit to me on my own that she only had me to tie my father down She forced my father into having me as he was too old to want another child As a little child she showed me a video of a little boy in an orphanage that needed a home If ever I did anything she didn t like she would drag me to the car and tell me she is going to take me to the orphanage and trade me in for this boy because he will appreciate everything she does If ever I did anything she majorly didn t like she would ban me from any electronic devices for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months Coupled with the fact I wasn t allowed to go out with friends that meant I was completely cut off from the outside world and had no communication with anyone other than school Up until I was 16 whenever we would stay at my grandmothers despite there being multiple other bedrooms she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her no pyjamas When I was 16 I got with my now wife we went to the same school At the start of the relationship even she struggled to see what I was on about My mother welcomed her with open arms would take her shopping she almost crafted herself as a mother to my wife who had lost hers very young My wife fell for this at first She slowly started to see more and more of my mother s true self over time We were massively restricted on time together and were only allowed together when my mother okayed it she would use that as leverage over me when we both started at the same collage we lied about an extra lesson so I could spend a extra bit of time with her during the week my mother the overly critical person she was phoned the collage and got my timetable sent to her Once she cross examined the timetables she flipped on my wife like she would with me She put all sorts of restrictions in place and made my wife out to be the devil even to my wife s family turning some of them against her The time restrictions were massively increased and I was getting harassed and emotionally getting abused to break up with her We put up with this until I turned 18 packed my bags and got in the car and drove off It was the most terrifying experience of my life Feeling sick does not even describe how scared I was to openly defy her for the first time I was forced to leave the majority of my positions behind which she still has in my room 8 years later set up despite my request to receive them My wife s grandparents thankfully took me in till we were on our own feet Over the years I have tried over and over to see or even speak to my father but everything goes through her Over the years his entire family has been estranged from him including my older siblings half siblings on my father s side so I have nobody that can relay a message I desperately want a relationship with my father as he was the only person that gave me the will to stay alive for the first portion of my life Without him been my pillar I would no doubt have kms as a child He is old now and has been manipulated to the point of becoming a weak old man that does exactly what she says He no longer has any family only her Whenever I try to reach out he says that he will only see or speak to me with her there I ve written a letter messaged and we had a phone call I am still affected by what she did and know it would massively affect me to even see her face never mind speak to her I know I will regret never seeing my father again when he dies but I am having to put my and my wife s mental health first He is never not by her side but I m desperate Can anyone offer any advice how I can manage this situation nobody not even chat GTP can give me any advice other than to start grieving him Thank you TLDR My mother is an abusive narc and won t let me have a relationship with my dad without her at my wits end on what to do",26.0,male,son,20-29

text body: I 13 F am writing this story because I need a mental relief for all the stress I am receiving from my household For context let me start from the beginning but I ll try to keep it short since I can t recap my mom s 18 years of trauma My mom had been married at the ripe age of 19 years and to a man 10 years older than her also my lovely father No it was not forced but arranged and arranged marriages are a custom in our country so nobody really objected My granny AKA my father s mother is the problem here my father is a darling honestly Through my mother s 21 years of marriage 18 years had been spent with that beast Let me tell you some stories ok My mom used to live in Qubar with my father after marriage but because of some financial issues she had to move in with my granny in India and my granny made her life a living hell She would make my mother work while pregnant with me in the kitchen while handling my other two sisters 3F and 8F at the time She would torture my mother mentally with her demeaning words spread lies about her around our relatives and even with maids And because of all this everybody started to look at her with hate Apart from the mental and physical torture she would put poison in the mind of my father through calls and since he was living in another country he would believe her My mother also didn t have a phone and all the money that my father sent from Qubar would be in the hand of my granny so she would make my mother desperate for every rupee She also wouldn t let my mother visit her mother and not even let her talk to any loved ones since my granny was the only one with the phone access In total my mother would be isolated from her lived ones hated by everyone around her and a total shell of a person My father would talk to her time to time but because of my granny they couldn t really bond My mom also started developing psychological issues which she had to take psychiatrist medicines for In total she has diabetes BP psychiatrist spondylitis and asthma And because of my mother s rapid decline in health my father finally noticed something was wrong My father would visit every 3 months only for a week tho and he slowly took notice of my granny s toxic behavior towards my mother keep in mind she would only act half as bad infront of my father Also I was born during this time So my mom says that I was a like ticket to safety for her After I was like 9 10 years old I used to remember my granny and mother shouting and my mother would be crying In one of these fights things got so serious that my granny kicked my mother out at 12 AM of NIGHT I remember sitting in an auto going to my nanna s mother s mother house while my mom was trying to hold it together When my father heard about this he didn t belive my mom and this was sweeped under the rug My mom s breaking point was when my granny cursed my middle sister 13 F at the time for hiding or rather taking batteries from her TV remote and putting them in our TV remote And my granny s exact words were May god destroy her life May she die Me and my middle sister were kinda mischievous in our childhood and my granny would not even give us 5 rupees to buy some snacks from the shop That s why when our TV remotes battery was finished my sister secretly took hers without asking And the cherry on top was my father heard her cursing on the phone he was supportive of my mother but this finally confirmed his suspicions And my darling mother who frankly doesn t have a back bone finally stood up for herself after 18 years of torture and that too for her kids She demanded a separate home and my father happily gave her one And this is the home we have been peacefully living in for the past 3 years But recently their has been some health issues my granny And the health issues aree constipation I mean who doesn t have constipation when they re 85 years old But no she acts like she s dying which I don t understand why she isn t That is why recently she came in our home and lived with us since she isn t healthy and is feeling lonely She was supposed to live for one week but she extended her stay for one more week And now she is requesting to my father to let her stay beside our apartment Keep in mind she is obsessed with TV and is also kinda deaf And my father agreed My mom has been facing PTSD with her living in or home but being the good wife she is she still takes care of her to a T Even after all the treacherous things my granny has done And the thought of my granny living with us permanently is having a lot of effect on my mother mentally Even after telling my father this he insists on letting her live beside us he isn t even listening After 3 months my father will retire permanently he now has a high paying job in Saudia Arabia and will come back to live with us He says he will take care of her but those are just empty promises So what should we do What is the solution to this mess How can my father fulfil his duty to his mother while being a good husband How can my mother live peacefully with her around My mother has given up since we can t find a solution Do you guy s have one TL DR my mentally and physically abusive granny abused my mother mentally for 18 years causing her diabetes BP asthma spondylitis and physiatrist issues and cursed my middle sister that she should die and that her life should be destroyed for taking her TV remote batteries which caused my mother to take a stand and move out into another apartment but now after 3 years my granny is demanding to move beside our apartment because she has constipation feels like she is gonna die soon and feels lonely my father is gonna retire permanently in 3 months so we still have 3 months before she moves beside us Can anyone give us a solution to this problem How can we stop her from coming beside us permanently Because my father bent up on his decision",13.0,female,daughter,10-19

text body: TLDR Sister is extremely selfish expects everyone to drop everything for her and her family Ongoing fights with no resolution Ok this is going to be long one so buckle up If you manage to get through this whole post thank you I am 30F and my sister is 33F I moved back home with my mum after I found out I was pregnant and couldn t afford a rental my partner and I tried for months but it s just too competitive We pay board and for groceries and all baby items My mum owns a 3 bedroom house and when I moved back in she said I could use two of the bedrooms one for me and my partner and the spare room for my daughters things such as drawers to put clothes in and eventually use it as her bedroom once she is old enough I feel comfortable with her being in a seperate room The bedrooms are very small so we don t have too much space the biggest room is my mums which is the master with a small walk in wardrobe and an ensuite this is important later My sister is married and has 3 children all 3 have adhd This is also important later Last year she cheated on her husband and ended up coming to stay with us for a little over a month with her 3 kids She ended up taking over the spare room so I had to move all of my daughters things to the garage even though I was due to give birth in 6 weeks time During her stay she didn t contribute financially she made a mess as did her children and she refused to clean up after herself or her children I m talking dirty nappies EVERYWHERE not even in a bag just on the floor dirty tissues fast food rubbish dirty dishes empty drink cans etc My mum would come home from work and run around cleaning everything instead of telling her to pull her weight mum would complain to me about her almost on a daily basis though All of her children are medicated and during the stay she refused to give the medication because and I quote I cbf even when her eldest child was having mega melt downs and begging her for the medication While she tells her kids to stfu if they are having a melt down or even if they re happy and laughing I don t want to hear them at all On a few of the days she was here the kids were in their iPads for 12 hours straight Which she usually just shoves their iPads in front of them won t encourage them to play outside won t do any activities with them etc So my mum and I ended up having to do a lot with the kids which is fine but it got exhausting especially while my sister would just lounge about all day and sleep She eventually went home but says we needed to keep the spare room set up for her incase she wanted to come back She s back with her husband and they are in their own rental etc This is where the issue started because we can t utilise the spare room we ve had to use the living dining area for drawers change table and some of our daughters things and we spend a lot of time in the living room during the day I had an extremely traumatic birth had to have a c section which got infected and had placenta inside causing another infection 5 weeks after birth and had to get two additional surgeries which I have another 6 8 week recovery ATM I can t even lift my daughter as I have a weight restriction I d also like to add that I m a first time mum after several losses so I m extra protective of my child Now my sister is coming over whenever she wants because she wants to see the baby not calling or texting first to see if we re busy or up for a visit I ve said to her that because we re so sleep deprived and I m still recovering we need to get as much rest as possible so please call or text if she s wanting to come see us Mums given her a key so she s been rocking up anytime she wants waking us up and the baby and is super critical of everything we re doing You re burping her wrong You re swaddling her wrong You re feeding her the wrong formula You re not doing enough for her Etc I have 3 kids so I know best We spent some additional time in hospital as my daughter was sick at 2 weeks old and we found out she has cow milk protein allergy so we have to feed her a special formula I couldn t breastfeed despite trying This is something she attacks me about constantly saying the doctors are wrong and she just has colic She comes to the house makes me and my partner feel unwelcome in our own space she treats mum like shit brings over full baskets of washing because she doesn t know how to use a washing machine She refuses to cook for herself or her kids doesn t know how to Refuses to work because she s incapable Tells mum she can t spend time with her friends or boyfriend borrows money she never pays back etc Mum just lets this happen and has for years I have another older sister and we have never and would never get away even asking mum to put on a load of washing for us we d probably get laughed at Tonight it got really bad She has come over the last 3 days in a row with her children and husband from like 9am until 9pm I have ASD and I get very overstimulated with lots of noise and loudness etc and she knows this But she was screaming at her children for everything under the sun but mostly for laughing and playing we were teaching them how to play a game on console She wanted us to have all 3 children sleep over and my mum said no and has been saying no for the last few weeks because she s not 100 well and it s too chaotic when they aren t medicated They also insist on sleeping in the living room not the room that was set up specifically for them it turns into a huge fight and melt down every time we have tried to get them to sleep in there I also explained to my sister that I am up ever 3 4 hours feeding changing nappies etc and I have to use the living room to do so so her kids sleeping in there would be too difficult as they would be woken up etc and it s just not reasonable She complains that she needs a break from her kids when they are in school and daycare 5 days a week the school kids go to before and after school care and she doesn t pick them up from school or daycare until 6pm She isn t working literally lays in bed all day and doesn t do anything around the house Her husband complains to me about it all the time Then she wanted to feed my daughter and I hesitantly agreed because I honestly needed a little break But while she was feeding her she was refusing to burp her until she finished her whole bottle 100ml and I was telling her no you have to burp her several times otherwise she ll vomit She ignored me and said she knows best cos she has 3 kids Her husband decided that he was going to rearrange the house and garden My partner asked if he needed help on several occasions and he either ignored him on a few times or said no Usually my partner does the gardening and mowing every 2 3 weeks but hasn t had the chance due to my surgeries and having to look after our daughter full time So we all stayed inside and watched tv During that time I was using my mums iPad and a text comes through from my sister bitching about me and my partner saying that we weren t helping her husband and I was like wtf Why not just talk to me if there s an issue Mum wasn t home so she didn t reply I tried to speak to her about it and she just blew up and I said I didn t want her to be disrespectful to us in our space and she went on a huge rant saying how we disrespect her and my mum and mum wants her house back etc Then went on to say I m going to end up a single parent and she doesn t think my partner is the one for me etc and was basically attacking every angle she could I did snap back and say a few of the things I listed above Then she said I am a lazy parent and my daughter deserves better She said she sees my partner doing everything for our child which he does do a lot and I had to remind her that I ve just had two additional surgeries I m healing and have a weight restriction and I physically can t lift my daughter My partner picks her up and brings her to me for feeds and takes her to the change table and I ll do the nappy takes her to the bath so I can bath her etc I will say I m super grateful for my partner being so supportive and helpful She also said this is not our house and we are just guests so only mum can tell her to call or message before she comes etc I ve set other boundaries in place regarding my daughter such as not kissing her I m not a kissy person and it s a risk with young children from what I ve been told And my sister will refer to my daughter as her baby and kiss her 20 times in the space of 5 minutes I have addressed it so many times with her among other things and I said if she can t stick to my boundaries and rules with my daughter then she needs to back off She eventually left and it was just a shit show My mum came home after a while and I explained to her everything that had happened Mum isn t one who wants to get involved which I totally understand I hate fighting and conflict myself so I always try to communicate and diffuse any crappy situation but my sister made it impossible this time because she continued to message me when she was at home and just was awful to me I m not sure what to do because I don t think she s capable of changing She has always been extremely self absorbed and any time she is told no by any of us she says she s depressed and if we don t do what she wants she ll kill herself _ Mum doesn t see this as an issue and takes her seriously every time she says it but she says it to everything Even if mum says she can t talk long because she has a meeting or she can t see her today because if xyz that s her go to I don t want to feel uncomfortable in my own living space and I am desperately looking to find another living arrangement with my partner and daughter To the point that we have services helping us look into crisis housing because of other things going on in the home family I m not really sure what I m hoping for posting this but I really needed to get it off my chest Thank you if you got this far and sorry it s so long",30.0,female,sister,30-39

text body: for some background here i 18F was adopted when i was 12 by my paternal grandfather and step grandmother they raised me and my little brother 16M since i was 7 and he was 5 when we had got taken from our bio dad but that s a story for another time things were never great but my little brother and i had definitely seen a lot worse fast forward to around the time the adoption was finalized and i was going thru a really hard time mentally ik ur probably thinking i was being bullied or something but school was actually the only thing i looked forward too it was the one place i knew i was liked bc i was farely popular until high school when i became antisocial from being basically kidnapped i was obsessed with losing weight so i wouldn t eat but my adopted mom still always called me f t and told me i needed to cut back for context ive never been f t at the age of 18 im 4 11 with a petite frame and have never been over 130 lbs they liked to call me a wh0re and tell me i was gonna be fast in the bc my mom had me at 16 they cut my hair so that i wouldn t be attractive to not be fast like my mom and was always told growing up that nobody would ever love me this still causes issues in my relationships and friendships i wasn t allowed to have any friends and when i did make any friends my adopted mom would find some reason for me to not hang out with them anymore she legit told me i couldn t be friends with one girl bc her mom was a single mom they would hit us a lot but we kind of just put up with it fast forward to aug 2019 i was in 7th grade and i told my adopted mom i had been feeling very sad lately and didn t know why i didn t know i was depressed or what depression even was bc mental health was never brought up hell the only time they even did anything abt our physical health was the dentist when we needed shots for school or when it was something really serious or what to do to be happy again and she told me i had nothing to be sad about and was exaggerating for attention so i let it drop and that honestly didn t help idk if it made it worse but ik it didn t help nov 2019 i tried taking my life for the first time in my closet with a blade from a box cutter razor i found downstairs months prior and had been using to SH my little brother unfortunately i say unfortunately bc he had to see that and this will forever be etched into his mind not bc i survived im forever grateful my brother stopped me that day walked into the closet and seen me and he ofc went and told i had a quite bit of blood loss but my adopted parents didnt seem bothered enough to even pretend to care my adopted dad shrugged it off as he went outside to smoke a cigarette and my adopted mom ran water over my cut and wrapped it up she made me clean my blood up which im not mad about bc i wouldnt wanna clean sb else blood either idk if they did this just to spite me or what but immediately after i was done cleaning i was told to get in the car we were going to get food so we go get food and she makes us also go to hella different stores and i ended up passing out in majority of those stores from the blood loss i was punished for staying up all night why else was i falling asleep while standing right after abt a week considering my cut was pretty deep and done with an old dusty box cutter razor that hadn t been cleaned don t judge me i wanted to d e the last thing i was worried abt was dried up bl00d it ended up getting infected i ended up having to take antibiotics when it was finally looked at and got told i should ve came in for stitches since it was winter time tho i was able to cover it up with hoodies and long sleeved shirts except for in gym class in my district they make us dress out for gym in middle school to prepare us for highschool so ig sb seen and reported it to the school guidance counselor cus i got an ass whooping from hell when she got home from work that night for letting family business be known to the public we were always told that what happens behind closed doors stays behind closed doors well dec of 2019 i met a senior at the highschool and being in seventh grade i didn t realize how weird it was that a 12th grader wanted to date a 7th grader but i just felt like i was special bc nb else had an older boyfriend just me so anyways he asked me to sneak out with him i had never done that before but being young and immature after awhile of hearing if you loved me you would do it yes being older i now see all the signs and take full responsibility for what happened but i snuck out with him and we went to the park innocent enough but he ended up r ping me on the park bench and when i told my adopted parents the next morning i was called a wh0re and much more i didn t go to school that day bc my adopted dad was taking me to the doctor they never once asked if i was okay or if i was hurt just immediately told me i was lying abt being r ped bc i had gotten pregnant we go to the dr dr confirms im not pregnant and that i have trauma consistent with assault to this day they still haven t asked me who or how or anything they still think im lying before we left the dr i was asked to fill out a mental health questionnaire and the results to that questionnaire deemed me high risk so i got taken to the mental hospital and from dec 2019 to march 2023 i was consecutively in different mental hospitals residentals and group homes and with my occasional law breaking about 6 months out of that time was in a juvenile detention center in march 2023 i ran away from the group home i had ben staying at for almost a year at that point when i moved in with my brother and was kept there the whole time against my will but technically i was on the run til jan 2024 when i got out that house in jan 2024 i was sent to live with my adopted parents once again one thing i didnt add is that i was a living walking breathing nightmare while i was in those treatment facilities anybody who has been in any of the four will tell you it will change who u are ur not looked at as human by the staff they looked at us like paychecks i have so many stories of staff doing more to traumatize us kids than they did to help us but bc my behaviors were so bad they couldn t find anywhere else to take me that s why i had to go back btw but i thought ill be 18 in a year and ik i dont wanna be here a minute longer than i must so i got a job and started saving i bought my first phone that i paid for and kept turned on with my own money everything i owned shoes clothes makeup perfume hygiene products was bought with MY money that I worked really really hard for work was the only time i was able to get away from them until i went back to school to get my GED which was only a week before the incident so anyways work was my safe place i used to come in early and stay late i would call on my days off and ask if i could come in i worked at a burger king so we always had call outs and my managers knew everything that was going on in that house bc i live in a very small town and word gets around and they were never shy to yell or argue in public and if my hours got to high they would just let me sit in the back office so i wouldnt have to be home after about a month of living there her and my little brother got into a really big argument bc he was eating at the table where he normally eats and she for some reason wanted him to eat downstairs i was not home for this i was at work this is just what was told to me by my brother he refused saying he wasn t in the mood to be around people and just wanted to be alone but she wasn t having it she then goes to the kitchen and starts closed fists punching my then 15 year old brother in the face and he never once hit her back but she busted his lip pretty bad to the point that he stayed up for me to come home so he could cry in my bed and talk to me abt it i took pictures and sent them to cps but when they asked him he said he got scared and lied and said he fell after that i couldn t look at her the same so a lot of arguments occurred one night abt a week after that fight with my brother she randomly comes into my room at 2am to ask me if ive stole her phone i asked her why would i buy and pay for my own phone if i was gonna just steal hers i was then told to give her my phone for talking back and said that i was grounded but i refused bc i paid for my phone and told her i will gladly give u my phone if u give me the money i paid for it but that just made her madder so she went and got my adopted dad yes at 2am and they came into my room and yelled at me for like 10 minutes for me to give them my phone and i kept repeating the same thing to them everytime until my adopted dad told me if i didn t give it to him he would beat it out of me so i told him go ahead and do it so he hit me and i wasn t hitting back at first because he is still my biological grandpa at the end of the day but then my adopted mom jumped in so i did start hitting back once i hit back they called the police long story short i got locked up even tho it was self defense it was two people s word against mine i got locked up and was locked up from the end of feb 2024 til may 2024 while i was in detention i obtained my GED and got accepted into esthetician school at an academy abt an hour away the whole time i was locked up i called every chance i could and never got any answer i was found guilty but bc i had behave the whole time i was in the dhome got my GED and got accepted into school i was allowed to leave the dhome on probation because returning back home was obviously not an option this time i was sent to an independent living program which would end up being another traumatic experience that i actually just got out of two weeks ago which brings us to why im thinking abt suing so my DSS worker picks me up from the dhome with all my stuff that was supposed to have been packed i got in the car and saw one bag ik i didn t own a lot since everything i owned i bought with my minimum wage job and still had a phone bill my part of rent and food to buy with those checks but i worked a lot and had made a lot of money so i knew i would have at least 3 bags but when i asked my DSS worker she said that s all she was handed so i was like idk maybe they packed tf out that bag but i get to my brand new apartment and open the bag and find a single a sock a pair of underwear 3 pairs of sweatpants 2 blankets and a fitted sheet no shoes no shirts none of my hygiene stuff none of my other bedding NOTHING so ofc i contact my DSS worker and inform her and i also let her know that my adopted mom should have about 400 that belong to me from my last check at burger king before i got locked up the only way i was allowed to get the job was if i got the money sent to her bank account so my DSS worker tells me she ll talk to them they claimed that s all that was in my room and that they had already given me my last check i wasn t too worried abt the check idk y but i wasnt it got sent out while i was locked up so it like in my head it didn t really exist idk if that makes sense but anyways turns out they let my cousin go in my room while i was locked up and lied to her and told her i said she could go in there and take wtvr she wanted bc my new house wasn t big enough for everything i was still in the dhome and independent living wasnt on the table at that point so she goes in my room and takes practically everything everything in the bag was all she left yeah she even took my underwear and i honestly don t know what happened to the phone i was upset at first but i eventually got over it but im still very upset abt the fact they gave away everything i paid for with my money and everytime i bring it up to them i get called ungrateful bc they gave away a lot of freedom and time and money to take care of me and my little brother and they ve spent more money on me then i did on anything in that room so aita if i sue them to replace everything they gave away",18.0,female,adopted daughter,10-19

text body: I 36F have always had a rocky relationship with my sister 27F We will call her M From the day she was born chaos has always ensued She didn t have colic or anything like that but cried all the time day to night Night to day My mother who has not always been the most stable this is important for later has NEVER been able to console her She would try everything but still And it seems like they just never connected She loves my sister without a doubt but the bond was never there It was left on me because it was even difficult for my stepfather to deal with Hes just an Ahole again will be prevalent later but they didnt last longer than 10 years ALL through my sister s life she was definitely different and manipulative If I didn t do something she wanted she would threaten to tell my mom or something I would get into trouble because rather than deal with the issue my mother would say just give it to her so she ll shut up She also slept in our mother s bed till she was 14 regardless of her having a boyfriend who also lived with us He would be sent to the couch or spare room because if she didn t get her way yup threats would ensue And they were WILD In any case this would happen when she didn t get her way I paid no mind to it because by this time I was older and just graduated moved in with my boyfriend and was pregnant with my first child I would still take her sometimes as a big sister would One instance I can remember was I brought her to the fair with MY DAD we were sitting at the pizza joint and M was pulling antics to get anything other than pizza I wasn t paying so I told her no she started to get flippy and my father said she may be your sister But she s MY daughter you cannot speak to her that way For the first time I saw shock and heard silence from this child Fast forward a few years later My mother had given in to every whim been to every event And was not the perfect mother but an appeasing one My grandmother was sick dying of cancer My mother gave custody to my sister s dad because he would not let her leave the state with my sister even to take care of her dying mother She was gone for 6 months before my grandmother passed And only staying behind for a few months after to take care of the estate When she returned for the funeral my sister was the most horrible person to her Saying she abandoned her she was glad my grandmother had died Even throwing a fit at the funeral to leave because she was bored Yes a 16 year old who knew better I was appalled and felt horrible for my mother They re relationship became tumultuous at best after that and I stayed cordial because I truly just did not like her as a person I loved her But it s not something I lost sleep over when she didn t call me back or didn t see her for 2 months etc I still tried to have a relationship She was nice enough to let my 15 y o daughter L stay with her for a month while she finished up freshman year when we had to move out of state Awesome I sent my daughter 50 p wk and supplied all her food through a delivery app for her and extras for my sisters household So she wasn t an inconvenience to M And my daughter L would stay with my other sister B for the last month they live in the same community some of her things had been left behind at M s house and I got a very irate phone call threatening to have everything thrown out because she no longer wanted them there Knowing full well I was unable to come and get them as i wasnin another state Our mother who overheard this called my sister and they had a screaming match saying not so kind things to each other and ultimately blocking each other So I had my mom message M s fiance to make him aware of the situation and ensure my daughters things would be safe I called my dad to have the items picked up and he was there within 2 days to get it I continued to carry on my relationship with my sister with her belittling my mom as toxic because she got her fiance involved She doesnt want him to know the real her I supported her decision to not speak to our mother but always insisted she forgave her as it was also a reaction to M s toxicity as well Our mother had apologized and didn t feel it was fair for her cut her off over M s outburst I felt sorry for our mother As M got married and is expecting her own child very soon She wanted to be involved and M just wasn t having it But still remains talking to others instead By pure Manipulation at best and posting on social media negatively about our mother I called her out on it I ve apologized and forgiven where I can in life But I pointed out her toxicity as well Even towards her own niece Now I m cut off too and waved me never meeting her child in my face Fine But then she also took to messenger to tell my kids how much she loves them even if we are not speaking THAT is when I finally lost it Her manipulation of this entire family was done I will NOT have her do that with them as well I called her every name in the book and told her to F OFF and blocked her on everything So we come down to today She s in labor Our mother and I found out through another family member which I think is insane that they know to begin with Because as thos other person is also a mother they still HAVE to be on M s side with all of this when I feel as a family we should band together to make my sister see the error of her terroristic lifestyle but I guess that s just me she will never know how much this is hurting the family But she doesn t care I need advice in what to do I m so lost I don t like having this much animosity towards someone who deserves it and she is also breaking our mothers heart What should I do I hate that I care",36.0,female,sister,30-39

text body: Hello Reddit It is my first time posting in this forum I feel like I need some advice from people who have experience something similar regarding family dynamics and sibling abuse so if you even take the time to read this post I will feel at least some sort of acknowledgement Please note that English is not my first language therefore this post will most definitively have some spelling grammar and expression mistakes Forgive me for this Nonetheless I feel it is important to get this out into the world regardless of how many mistakes I make along the way As the aforementioned paragraph says this post will deal with a lot of unhealthy dynamics within the family and some forms of physical and psychological abuse If these topics are of trigger to you please reframe from keep reading This can hurt you and your mental health comes as a priority in all times Keep yourself safe and take care of yourself My sister 32F and I 26F have always had a complicated dynamic I was born with complications regarding some benign tumour that had to be removed when I was very young still at 2 years old After the operation took place I had several aftereffects such as loss of mobility on the whole left side of my articulations and loss of the ability to walk that had to be dealt with for an extended period of time Amongst these ways of treatment was homed physiotherapy which included activities such as swimming walking playing as much as I could so I can get physical movement around my whole body and try to recover This part is one thing that I learn the day that I spoke to my mum the day that I wanted to speak about the events that I will explain in further paragraphs That my sister had to take most of the initiative into getting me to walk play around and do physical stuff by in most cases taking little pushes from my back so I could get up on my on and walk I m not quite sure if it was something that was meant to be done in favour of my recovery but my mother believed it to be so and doctors explained to her that it was okay for my sister to do such things Apart from this treatment and operation during which period according to my mum my sister expended alone with my grandparents in a household where my grandmother had all the saying and decision making and led to my sister developing unhealthy habits and coping mechanisms for communicating her needs and worries my sister and I were raised equally We were raised in a very grateful and welcoming family that will hear us and be for us in anything we might need or be helped with These following events are a collection of very distanced and blurry recollections of what was happening at those times as well as some not so much detail recollections of what my sister was going through at the time so take these following paragraphs with a whole container of salt When I was mid ages 7 8 I started receiving physical reprimands from my sister for not properly do the chores around the house with her while our parents were out for work near our house on a greenhouse of their own they both were self employed at the time and my dad had to help my mother keep the greenhouse flowers every day especially on Saturdays so If I needed some sense of security from someone I had to physically leave the house and walk to where they were staying there so I wouldn t have to deal with the physical damage and screams from my sister until it was time to get back home Every time these events would happen my parents would talk to my sister on the dinner table at dinner time and say to her what was wrong with that behaviour but it didn t go far from this that they would stand up for me so I opted for keeping going to the greenhouse every time this happened to feel a sense of temporary relief This happened every Saturday morning from the moment my sister woke up 11 am to mid afternoon 2pm when it was time for lunch all together These physical reprimands would be slaps across the cheeks strong enough that I will cry and eventually sooth myself out so cleaning could be dealt with around our home When we were about the ages of 12 me and 18 my sister years old she started these series of jokes which including inappropriately touching my breasts and butt out in front of my family saying things like Lily not real name what a delightful ass you have or you have some soft and big breasts sis while touching my areas I would then react immediately by getting away from her grip saying out loud Stop to her face and begging for my family to do something Again it would end in some verbal light reprimand and it would be forgiven no matter how much env arrased or violated I would feel afterwords This led me into a mindset that forced me into believing for a very long time that family is not someone to hold a grudge against because no matter what they would do to me it was for a reason I was not comfortable with this mindset and I know now that in fact it is not the case at all but it was the mentality that allowed me to survive all the years my sister kept on living with my family and I Through years of self reflection I now know that although I also made many mistakes with getting back to my sister I would learn to respond to her physical abuse with verbal abuse judging her type of mentality and acts like something to reprimand and despise I hurt her a lot because I felt at the time that it was the only way to feel some sense of justice to now realized that I only caused her more pain along the way that she stills battles with I didn t deserve any of that sort of treatment So I tried spending the time that my mind and hart allowed me to to hang out with my sister along with my parents thinking that enough time and thinking had passed since this sort of reactions could have ever repeated themselves nowadays I was wrong My sister visited us by the end of March this year She came to visit after asking for some vacation leave to her workplace now in Switzerland and came to spend some time in our country Spain and our home She was planning on doing a lot of things together while visiting us every day for at least an hour and hang out with our grandmother and grandaunt they now live with my parents since is much safer for them to be around our parents and live more relaxed and cared for On Thursday that week my sister wanted my mother and me to go shopping and spend some time together so we arranged that they would let me know via text when would they be arriving to the entrance of the city I live with my partner since three years ago a 20 minute drive from where my family lives so I could be ready on the road waiting to get in the car together with them so they didn t have to wait a long time for me to get ready The journey started with them not letting me know when they arrived at the entrance of said city Instead they let me know they were at my door and they were waiting Once I get on the car after some time and while we were arriving at the shopping centre my sister started lashing at me about our decision to move our of the family house to be an independent couple living together and that we were wasting money instead of just moving into the empty house in which our grandmother used to live before our granddad died she still goes every afternoon to do chores and watch TV amongst other things I tried to argue that it was something that we were looking forward to doing even if it was economically challenging and that even if it meant not saving as much money as in any other household situation we were really happy about our decision but my sister tried to keep imposing that it was a dumb decision by which point I started saying that If we weren t willing to listen to neither of our opinions that I would prefer to end the conversation They raised their shoulders in disbelieve and said that it would also meant for me to try and listen to their arguments but I was not up to it if it means standing arguments in an imposing and judgemental manner not actually listening to my accounts and taking things from their perspective only I tend to also do that a lot when it means talking matters with my family I am also to blame for that sort of habit with them At some point in the shopping trip we were starting to consider to get back home but not without visiting one last shop This part is still very vivid in my head and body and will be the most descriptive of all We were at this store looking at some accessories for hair and hair claws when some girls intended to come into the shop where we were somewhat crowded and it so happened that they entered by where we were standing so they pass behind us My sister and mum were around me by this point my mum to my left my sister to my right somewhat behind so my sister let the girls in by stepping forward and bumped into my back When this happened I feel her hands holding my ass for far too long of a time saying to almost just us that my ass was very firm My mother was by my side and I went furious on the insides but hold composer due to the crowed of people that surrounded us and that in that moment I didn t want to raise concerns to anyone counting that my mother could have seen or heard all that have happened and that I told my sister at that moment to Stop by saying her name loud and firm while getting away from her grip After some thought on what happened that day and the acknowledgment that the touching happened again so many years later in plain sight out in public I confide into my partner s parents my worries about how my parents could react if I were to tell them what happened and that it was the same behaviour they were aware of years prior to my sister s independency They were very wellcoming aknowledging that of my sister s behaviour throught the years as far from acceptable and that I should talk things through to my parents in order to have their side and from there being able to make a decision as to what sort of relationship I wanted with my sister from now on The conversation took place this last Sunday when I visited to have lunch with my parents and grandmother and grandant alltogether while my partner stayed home due to the conflict of not being able to do anything to remedy the situation but to hear my side of the situation The conversation took place without my grandma and grandaunt present at that moment My mother spoke the whole time they wanted to say their side My dad was silent all the way through and even stepped outside of the house and came back after some moments My mother said that it was really bold and irresponsable for me to implie there was an abuser in our family refering to my sister and her behaviour and that I should be aware of how these acts would other members of the family feel about me accusing my sister of such things I didt n say abuser at any point of the conversation and limit myself to explain about the events of Thursday afternoon and their similarities with what my sister used to do to me in front of them things they were made awared of when I spoke out about them right when they happened That I needed to fix things with my sister if I felt I had a problem with her and that she doesn t understand how could I see those touchings as abuse because all she was able to see was a form of care and affection I don t really know how to react to this sort of mentality regarding abuse and my own experience with my sister I feel denied from all validation from my family I love them but I really don t understand the perspective of taking signs of abuse as affection How can I move past this mentallity I still love my family and love them deeply but it really hurts that they are backing my sister my 32 year old sister on this one I have still an appointment with councelling on June planning on seeing if there are chances of rescheduling for some date earlier than then I don t know what steps to take to solve this barrier without it distroing my integrity with my own sence of self respect I feel like if I just at least have some more aknowledgement it would motivate me enough to keep working on myself and on getting to work my feelings out Right now just hearing about my mum or hearing her speak hurts a lot I know she doesn t have a fault on this and that my sister is a daughter of hers too but it hurst a lot Sorry for such a long post I appreciate your time and dedication you put into hearing and reading this out Thank you for being here and for taking time of your day and energy to read this",26.0,female,sister,20-29

text body: I 20f live with my parents I dont have a drivers license yet but working on that I am also in a 1 5yr relationship with my boyfriend m22 who also lives with his family My relationship with my boyfriend is wonderful and he always encourages me to do my best He is very selfless when it comes to helping me with anything whether it s offering solutions to daily problems to as far as having me move in with them to improve my mental and emotional help from my parents I have a younger brother who is 19 and my relationship with him I would say is about normal We both attend online school with a tech school with high end tuitions we re not rich had to file for the FASFA We also work part time but i work more than him because his classes are more demanding for time I pay the home electricity and he pays the internet because our mother wanted us to have an understanding of bills which we both already knew because we have our own I graduate in September and turn 21 in a month from now My relationship with my parents I dont think is horrible but definitely could be better My father has PTSD and BPD borderline personality disorder and some other issues who gets easily pissed off In the past when we were younger he was more aggressive and threw things but never harmed any of us When we moved to our current town 7yrs ago with a new scenery and change of pace he gotten better especially with therapy for a few years My mother has a very technical mind where as long as everyone is fed and housed everyone s fine She still has the mindset since she was younger but in the past year or so she s worked on herself to better understand my father and me and my brother Shes not a very emotional or empathetic person but she tries to help in some ways She says I m alot like my father mainly in downing myself and tending to bring up past things and a few other things But I m very emotional understanding and very kind spirited the smallest topic that really bothers me will make me tear up for no reason Onto the point The past 6 months or so has been stressing bc my father didn t want to drive anyone mainly me to and from anymore bc I m not appreciative of him doing so he s been the human taxi since I was young I ve managed to find rides thanks to my coworkers and sometimes my boyfriend when he s able to due to him working fulltime I would hear my parents go back and forth about me and my relationship and my future mainly hearing dad He would say things like how I m throwing everything I ve worked for by being with my boyfriend who doesn t really have a career in mind My bf said he s the type to work whatevers needed and wants us to be long term bc of how well our relationship is compared to our past ones od being used I tokd him it bothers me he has nothing really planned for himself to which he said theres some things he wants to do but takes money like anything else My father would also say how I m selfish for things like still buying crap which I hardly do anymore except for snacks like once a month and a few packs of whatever single Pokemon card packs I see bc that s my hobby and how I proclaim about eventually moving in with my boyfriend s family Me and him finally got into an argument a few weeks ago and let everything out My parents never liked my boyfriend simoly because of how immature he was back in our freshman year of high school WHO ISNT AT THAT AGE And how obsessed he was with his then girlfriend They call him narcissistic and a f boy because of the couple of girls hes been with and the moment he gets intimacy from me he ll leave like most other guys Little do they know I gave my v card to him the mid last year and it s been a year later and we re still amazing I know my folks want the best for me like any other parent who wants their children to succeed My mom religiously tells me to keep saving to get a car obviously used for a first time car and to save for my own place and for me to stay living with them til I m able to do so I told her and my bf I feel like I m on a time limit about the car thing bc what if soon after I graduate I need to drive an hour away or move to a different area for my new career yk My parents proclaim how they re so proud of me and my brother bc of our school successes and keep us on track to do good and keep us from the riffraff bad kids They were more concerned with us doing good in school and having a good childhood that they didn t really teach us anything as we got older They were more supportive of me when I was little than throughout highschool up til now I don t feel supported for making certain decisions My father is really clinging to us because he doesn t have anyone left in his side of the family now after my grandmother passed away in October from cancer that she miraculously survived 4 5yrs after her original diagnosis Like my mother said as he clings more to us I feel he s also pushing us away because of how he s going about it Like I tell my boyfriend and some trusted coworks is that I have more emotional issues with my father than my mother but both seem to not want to understand things from another point of view In the emotional and mental side of things I feel like because of their disinterest of understanding me not only as their daughter but as an adult I feel pushed away from the things my father says as if he has no faith in me From either of them I don t feel respected as an adult in my home simply because it s our house and you will respect us Yes I get that and always have but they don t do the same They say how im wanting to be an adukt but still act like a child and they dint want to deal with it They dint realized that young adults even uo til like 25yrs old still need support and guidance from their parents They say im childish because of who im with and my tendencies to buy pokemon cards and still try to hangout with old friends They blame my boyfriend for how I ve been how much more of an attitude I ve had how I m disrespectful Witnessing and hearing him and his mother argue sometimes or what we talk about tells me more about a better way of resolving things When They argue they eventually apologize and find a solution while my parents grow more distant because of miscommunication That s not me saying my boyfriend s family is better everyone has their own family problems My boyfriend and I have serious talks not arguments about life things what needs to change me needing to move out to have my peace again my driving and license issues etc I know it would be wise and mature to buy my own car and buy or rent my own place but I don t make enough for either after paying the house electricity and my bills I m lucky enough to theoretically make 300 payments for a car but people want more a month or buy it outright in cash neither I can currently do even with 800 saved 200 thanks to my mom I just need to know if I really should move out I originally planned to after graduating and move in with my man but even he says it s getting worse the longer I let it go on I told him other than not having my own vehicle yet and have to worry about getting to and from work bc they live 15mins away while we live 5mins from work the only other thing that s holding me back is that daughter guilt The guilt of the bill I pay for falling on my brother or my mom being in the red after paying it every month or something happening between my parents or if somethings happens in my relationship and I m not welcome back home and hear I told you so by everyone My man re re reassures me that won t happen bc of how healthy our relationship is but I cant help but feel unsure about literally EVERYTHING in my life I m not even fully confident in my career choice and it going anywhere and be stuck with the loan debt like most people nowadays I would really appreciate some advice sorry for the long story lol",20.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: Warning This is a lot longer than I orginally had intended So I apologize in advance Thank you So I 20F have 3 younger siblings but the second oldest 15M is the one we have been having trouble with but before we dig in let me give some context So my parents have fought for as long as I can remember like it was so bad that 14 year old me would have to physically get in between them for them to separate They would yell curse throw and knock things out of anger which terrified my two youngest siblings But as my brother and I got older we got so used to it that we didn t even flich whenever they would say I want a divorce because we knew they would make up like 3 days to a week later It s been that way since I was potty trained it seemed like my mom and step father hated each other but at the same time loved each other Now looking back it was just toxic all the way around But I digress about 4 months ago after 15 years of marriage I guess my dad just couldn t stand us anymore Behind all of our backs he decided to pay for a home packed his things and a week after Thanksgiving just dipped without even saying goodbye Since he s been gone we ve just been finding out more and more stuff he lied or hid from all of us I m thankful that my mom was able to at least get a job before all of this went down After he left he cut my siblings insurance he lied for months about keeping up with the bills when he hadn t paid any of them including the bill for his OWN DAMN CAR he opened several credit cards one of them was put in my mother s name with her knowing and he maxed them all over so we re talking at least 15 000 probably more in debt and Because my mom is so behind and is making minimum wage we are literally in the process of practically losing our home And this whole damn time the asshole had checked up on any of us kids not once hes too busy having fun with with friends or whatever So as you can imagine is been very hard here but let me finally get to the point of this post My brother who we will call Smith has been going through a lot these past couple of months My step father used to pick on him and call him weak pathetic so he already had really low confidence Well a few months ago he started looking at adult inappropriate context using his school issued laptop to do so Now my mother is a very devote God loving woman That was another reason why they split up because they were going in different directions And after she had a really really bad phase with my step father that had to do with corn she absolutely HATES anything that has to do with that kind of stuff and I can understand where she s coming from However in a lot of ways my brother resembles his father from his looks to his mannerisms sometimes Anyway my mom ended up catching him in the act the first thing she did was beat the crap out of him but after she calmed down They had a seemingly heart to heart talk and he said he wouldn t do it anymore He started behaving better so we thought that would be the end of it That is until the past couple of weeks Smith has been having a lot of issues With his friends who also look at that kind of stuff He s been failing most of his classes has lied to us about it and mom discovered again that he snuck into her bedroom to look at stuff again And the final straw was yesterday when he and my youngest brother got in a argument and instead of walking away like a normal teenager he shoved him and one my youngest brothers prized possessions ended up getting broke My mom snapped at him and told him You either need to get your shit together or get the f k out and go stay with him because I can t deal with this I can understand where she s coming from I really want to be sympathetic towards him but I feel like every time I try to defend him he does something stupid As for the whole corn thing I don t really know how to handle this situation As a young female I don t have nor do I understand that urge I don t think my mom really does either Part of me believes that she thinks that if he just ignores it it ll go away I m pretty sure it s deeper than that but at the same time it s just hard to understand Since my mom is working everyday and I m also working and in college part time we really don t have the time to practically babysit him on everything he does So I am looking for advice from guys but Women can also be included in this as well on how do not only talk to him but also break it down to my mother who might get angry",20.0,female,sibling,20-29

text body: My dilemma Am I helping my kids or damaging them My 45F mom 66F let me know yesterday that she feels like she is walking on egg shells around my kids 11F 10M 9F and 5F The 10M is on the autistic spectrum though high functioning and the 5F has ADHD For background my mom engaged in several different types of abusive behaviors while I was growing up She did not know and was encouraged not to stand up to my dad so she took her anger and frustration out on us kids Being the oldest I have the most memories of this time period When I was about 15 years old both my parents began getting therapy and studying parenting courses and things improved significantly About a year ago while watching my children my mom took them to the supermarket ended up forgetting the bananas at the checkout station realized it after she and the kids were already out in the van and requested my oldest then 10F to go into the store by herself and retrieve the bananas At that time my daughter told my mom she didn t want to go into the store by herself She asked if one of her younger siblings could go with her My mom insisted she go in by herself My oldest daughter did as my mom asked but was very upset by being asked to go into a very large very busy store by herself Once I had the kids back at home my daughter asked to no longer go to Grandma s house I found out what happened from both my daughter and my mom and asked my mom to please not have my kids go by themselves into the store by themselves especially if they are saying they do not want to My oldest stayed cautious around Grandma but eventually seemed ok until some new infraction occurred This time my oldest refused to tell either Grandma or me what Grandma had done that she did not like I asked my mom what happened and she had no clue While my daughter might just be a horrible communicator which is why my mom was unaware she had done anything that caused a problem it is also true that having allowed herself to be a doormat to others my mom occassionally walks over other people the way she allows herself to be walked over But this does not happen often now as far as I know Though I asked my oldest what had happened several times over the next 2 months the only information I got was that it had something to do with Grandma Eventually my oldest confessed she couldn t remember what had happened that made her so upset Not certain if there was a legitimate concern or my daughter was just emotionally immature and not handling conflict well I did not pursue the subject My oldest has continued to be withdrawn from Grandma and now brings her tablet and hides away from others for most of our visit at Grandma s My oldest does get angry at me often Though most of the time I agree with her I was in the wrong Only twice has my oldest stayed angry at me for more than a night I have anger management problems that I am working on but the progress is slow as it is tied into my childhood trauma Yesterday while again watching my 4 children My mom watches them about 6 8 times a year my son brought some of his Legos to her house which is not allowed because in the past he has stolen her Legos pretending they belonged to him My mom thought he again incorporated some of her Legos into his current creation and his creation got damaged He freaked out insisted all of the Legos were his and began yelling throwing some of the Legos and leaving the room 2 of my other children let my mom know that what she did was not ok I addressed my son yelling and throwing the Legos by telling him that being upset was ok and telling Grandma what she did that he did not like was ok but yelling and throwing things was not ok I also reminded him he is not allowed to bring his Legos to Grandma s house because he stole Legos from Grandma s in the past He grabbed his Legos and went out to the van to wait for the rest of us While my 5 years old continued to tell Grandma what she did was not ok My mom has been upset and uncomfortable about these three combined events She let me know she feels like she is walking on egg shells and feels I do not back her up and support her rules with my kids While she finds watching my kids uncomfortable she has no problem with my brother s 6 children and believes this is because my brother and SIL teach their children that Grandma s house has her own rules and they have to follow them While I suspect I am siding with my kids As a side note while my children struggle in school and 2 have an identified learning disability my brother s kids are all high achievers So I do suspect the problem is me I realized after my conversation with my mom the conflict between her and m kids is so uncomfortable I have been reducing how often she watches them I am getting ready to almost stop having her watch them altogether now finding out that my 2 oldest don t want to be there and Grandma is also uncomfortable But am I really doing what is best for them Or am I socially disabling them",45.0,female,mother,40-49

text body: Hello I am 37 year old man from Mumbai India Married to my wife 35 year old and having a daughter of 8 year old I cheated on my wife Why I don t have any justification I know what I did was wrong But do I have choices I am from middle class family and an elder son of my parents Things started pretty early in my life I am more near to my grandparents rather than my parents and after my grandparents passed I can t find that connection with parents anymore Things adds up when I started with my job at 23 and bought my first flat at age of 25 First car at 26 With no time to enjoy the age I had 0 friends the only people in my life was from my office colleagues become my friends and I tried to open up a little I found my love in office only and we got married Even though we belong to same caste and social background things got worse for me Daily quarrel between my mom and wife adds up to my mental state and many time I have gone through mental breakdown crying at night when everyone sleeps is kind of started happening regularly I tried to converse this with wife but it s not helping it s like taking sides no one is ready to define what is right and what is wrong Everyone thinks they are right Making fool of myself I tried to end this situation by living separately but it adds up more since we got our daughter and things were not good with my wife s job I never wanted she to quit her job to make the life easy for daughter and home I left it to her to decide We ended up living together with parents to make the everything go easy for everyone It s not that I never interacted with my parents about the state of my mind but according to them it s what everyone deals with so I am no different They never understood whats happening inside me As days passed the communication between me and my wife started hitting the bottoms She is more comfortable with managing the daughter and doing all chores at home and her job And she seems happy about it however we were awful in bed with no communication She does care of me a lot but she didn t have solution of my problems I started wishing to run away from my daily life to achieve mental peace now It s not that I don t love my family or wife or daughter but I cannot stop loving myself to smile back at them For many days I keep on searching for Goa holidays I used to plan for things to do a bucket list but I never got chance to execute it The bucket list was very simple if you ask for 1 Spend entire day at beach 2 Have conversations with foreigners 3 Ride a bike with someone behind me 4 Try a fish dish 5 Visit a good nightclub 6 Taste alcohol As you see above I have this missing from my entire life Somehow I lost all these years of mine One fine day I just booked it I did reservations of a 4 star hotel in north Goa Before few days I started searching for some sites to get a travel companion with me After searching for few I found a girl who is 23 and accepted my request to become companion It was one of the hardest decision of my life harder than earning money Being married to go with an unknown girl and staying with her in same room for 5 days I know I could have booked two rooms but I am also a human being I see opportunity in this not all items are in bucket list I somehow convinced my family that I am visiting delhi for office work but went to Goa for holiday As I reached hotel I saw a young girl waiting for me in hotel lobby for check in To be frank my body was shivering meeting her and shaking hands with her We both checked in and went to our room For initial 4 5 hrs we just discussed about our life why she do what she do Whats her exit plan to get out of this lifestyle to understand how she manages all this sort of things meeting with strangers etc I also opened up in fact I was able to open up more than with my wife as there was no expectations from her She was in listening mode She never questioned me for anything I am doing She told me that she has seen people going through worst conditions I clearly told her about my fear of someone finding us and recognising us in goa but she was very clear that she will manage and usually no one cares what happens in goa I really appreciate her clarity of dealing with things We went out and had a relaxed sunset with dinner During night I made few things clear I was not looking for sex I wanted a person who understands me and be with me on my sides In fact I asked for a cuddles while in bed We both went to sleep without getting physical but in my mind I have already cheated on my wife That night I had a dream about how I meet with her and all our marriage rituals It s one of the hardest night to sleep on Next day I told her about my bucket list and she agreed me to show some good places First one is to try fish its always been one of my to do thing to try a fish but I didn t know what is what And how to eat it That day and next day we tried Surmai Bangda Bombay Duck king fish etc with all the difference they have she helped me to understand how to clean those fishes and what to eat and techniques they mostly tasted to me similar to the coconut in a nutshell I thanked her from my bottom of my heart that she took me to different places A day after that I got all my bucket list checked going to beaches and talking to foreigners having beer We meet two beautiful girls from Germany and South America at querim beach they were on holidays We had a very good chat swim with drinks with them Next day I was a bit nervous about last few days and things been very crazy for me As an introvert person I couldn t have imagined doing all these stuff alone No way I would have been shitting in my pants before approaching And she dropped a bomb about a nightclub on Sunday at Hammerzz I have never been to nightclub not even any club in small cities I know what to expect but I was not ready to dance alone She gave me confidence that I will enjoy it So we got ready she chose a white cotton shirt with blue jeans with sneakers is the best choice for the party she wore a beautiful skirt she was looking very pretty Its been 11 PM when we reach venue and as we enter I unlocked one of the most crazy memory of my life It was one of the most memorable things I did in my life We started with beer and ended up with whiskey and with all sorts of snacks in between I saw young girls coming alone for party young boys looking for hitting on someone Old looking guys with young girls BTW I don t look 39 according to her I am not bald Infact I have dark hair and some salt pepper look and old ladies hitting on young guys It s all sort of crazy stuff I ever imagined happened in that one night We returned to hotel around 4 am not really that high but feeling sleepy and having painful legs It s that night she kissed me on my lips and we slept hugging each other And here I am sitting on bed next day morning and writing this confession Two more days to go I have already cheated on my wife by considering someone else in my bed But I achieved my lost years from my life I do regret what I did and why I did but the regret is overshadowed by the achievement from my personal front I do realise that money can buy happiness and infact all those years of hard word I did to skip the fun is in fact paying the charges for this tour I saved some money for self love out of my earnings that is what is sponsoring this trip I do have to face my wife and family with a poker face Not sure how things will turn out for me in future I really wanted to do things that I love from bottom of my heart but life with responsibilities is not allowing me to proceed I just wish to not repeat this episode again because if I do then it will go beyond repair Finally its true that What Happens in Goa Stays in

text body: Alright so I don t really know what I m doing here I guess I m kinda looking for somewhere to just vent it s gunna be pretty long because there s a lot of stuff I m covering There s also a lot of people involved so I ll try to keep everything an organized as possible but it ll probably get pretty chaotic lol I 18 f have lived with my mom majority of my life with her having primary custody of me and my sister 16 f I ll refer to her at J My mom and dad got divorced when I was about 5 and J was 2 A few years later my mom met the partner she s been with for over ten years I ll refer to him as A A was ok for the first few years he overstepped a lot and tried to make J and I see him as our father even going as far as making us call him dad But as I got older and my mom gave birth to my half siblings T 11 f and R 7 m his favoritism was more obvious A is a by the book narcissist nothing is ever his fault everyone loves him having to also control every single aspect of our lives J and I also had to live with constant mental and emotional abuse as well the older we got from both A and my mom Long story short living there was an absolute nightmare I graduated from high school May of 2024 and for a while it seemed as if things were finally starting to turn around I had two jobs throughout the summer and my mom was being less strict about who I was hanging out with and what I was doing I did find out that my mom had been taking money out of my account without me knowing and when I asked her about she had said it was to help with bills so I just dropped the subject I wouldn t have minded giving her some money to help out but it was the fact that she d been taking it without my knowledge A wasn t around as much cause he was going more traveling for his work it was a blessing to have a break from his constant judgement lol That was until the weekend of my eighteenth birthday My birthday was on a Sunday and my dad was planning on picking J and I up that evening I wasn t allowed to drive my car to my dad s because A payed for it I had spent the day with my best friend K A was out of town so my mom said we d just celebrate my birthday when he got back My sister T had a volleyball camp the next day that my mom had asked me to take her too she had a meeting at work that she couldn t miss and I agreed I had just been there planning on driving the car I d been using at my dads to drive to my moms house around the time my mom usually left for work But apparently my mom had gotten all upset because she d expected me to be there earlier to help get the kids ready to go something she did by herself most mornings because I d leave for work before the rest of the family even woke up My mom blew up texting me about how I was just an ungrateful brat who only ever cared about myself Keep in mind I m basically the oldest of a whole herd of kids from both mom side so I was constantly forced to be a third parent for my siblings Anyways that morning my mom told be to just drop both mine and J s phones in the mailbox at her house and said When it s convenient for me y all can get the rest of your clothes and stuff Spoiler it s been over six months since the incident and J and I still haven t gotten our stuff So just to recap everything mom made me take J and i s phones to her house J had to work and I still had to go to work that day I d just planned on going in later I had texted my dad about the situation since he was also at work and transferred all the money from the account that my mom had access to into a new account I also emailed myself screenshots of the conversation and deleted almost everything off of the phone I gave back to my mom I went to work barely holding myself together at the end of the day I talked to my boss and asked for the next day off to try and get everything sorted out and thankfully he was understanding and gave me the day I asked for That night when my dad came home he was absolutely pissed at my mom he made sure both J and I knew we could stay with him as long as we needed He also took me to get a new phone the next day and added my line onto his account he added another line and gave J his old phone I texted my mom s parents from my new phone and told them a less detailed version of what happened and they were also pissed My grandma went off on my mom and A her and my grandpa had stopped by my moms house to try and talk to them about it but from what I heard it turned into a screaming match between my mom and grandma Since the initial incident my dad was able to get primary custody of J that way my mom wouldn t be able to try and force her back to their house K has been super supportive she also went through something similar with her dad but that s not my story to tell Everyone on both sides of my family has been super supportive of J and I other than A s family because I m sure mom and A told them some bullshit story and not what actually happened I ve been trying to take lunch to T and R at school but last time I talked to T she said that she had gotten in trouble for talking to me so I haven t taken them lunch in a while because I don t want her to get in trouble I also found out a lot of stuff about my mom that has changed my view on her and I don t think I could ever see her the same way I used to So back to present day it s been almost exactly 8 months since my mom kicked J and I out and we still haven t been able to get our stuff J recently turned 16 and got her drivers license and has been talking about trying to get ahold of our mom since we re pretty sure she block my new number I told J not to text mom from her new number cause when I did that mom gave my number to A and he started constantly calling and texting me until I blocked him I just don t know what to do at this point because I have a lot of keepsakes and books and such that I want from my moms house but my dad said he doesn t want to fight my mom anymore I already called the police department and they said there s nothing they can do without a warrant or unless something physical happens So I guess if anyone had advice that would be greatly

here 30 years and still holds the thoughts and ways of their home country Met 2012 He owned a business after school care tutoring for kids and teens all the documents and bank accounts are in her name because he opened when he was 17 bought the lie she gave him that he couldn t have an LLC since he wasn t an adult No matter how he pointed it out she refused to sign things over despite I m tired of sitting in this office chasing people down for money We never saw bills and was only able to guess income she liked to haggle unapproved discounts and refused to up rates on old members Cuz my name is on the business she owned a landscaping business and Gio has been her employee since he was 14 Let s just say in both she liked to do some creative book keeping her favorite was not accurately reporting cash I say this cuz since gio was 14 she has given him allowances as he got older she paid him just enough to cover his expenses If he wanted money for a date night or anything she d hand him cash My nephew needed a math tutor he did it a few months before I started picking him Over those months we started talking at pick up Turns out they needed someone to do arts and crafts with the kids I had no problem working for 3 hours after my waitress shift We started dating after I started working for them 2013 Bella was thrilled by this when they talked but had nothing to say much to me She never tried to bond with me past gossip about clients in the office with the door open or I love my son but was a common phrase our early years together I had worked for small places before so a business check normal But since it was w9 i tax time I lost 1k of my return from my w2 job cuz she didn t let me know that it would be w9 vs w2 income More than once Bella would make a comment towards a kid about weight intelligence or religion culture Sometimes they went unnoticed other times he had to smooth things over always siting his mom s culture that sometimes she says things she doesn t realize mean something else One occasion we had a pizza party Bella to Muslim girl that wouldn t eat cheese pizza cuz sauce on it it s just like cheese bread but instead of dipping it in marinara it s on it Why do you have to be so picky Sighs well I guess you just won t eat then Your family is always so much trouble I remember she came in with a bad attitude made worse by kids being there whose parents didn t pay for the pizza party saying they pay at pick up Which was something she let slide before of course they did it I m allergic to tomatoes I walked in the office grabbed my cheesy bread and gave it to child When asked what I was doing we can share can t we girl nods besides it s not often I met someone else allergic to tomatoes Muslim kids in our care were told by their parents to tell staff they are allergic to pork Gio later asked while the kids watched a movie what that was about needless to say he nearly dragged her into the office If the kids needed help and she came over it was always a you re not even trying I m not helping you or you re really not getting this I m not just going to give you the answers Yes some kids just wanted us to give them answers but most of the time this wasn t the case heavy kids or just big eaters do you really need another snack You seem like you have had enough to eat You don t look like you are starving I got good at seeing when kids were struggling before they said to avoid her comments We lost kids often due to her words and actions Everyone in this country is just so sensitive Plus we didn t have contracts her idea cuz they are a hassle to cancel with the bank parents would just not bring the kids back we reached out she was to blame 75 off the time she had a very do it my way when I say to or you re doing it wrong and will mess everything up mentality I worked with her for 10 years was her DIL this attitude held even for me I wasn t allowed to talk or take payments from parents only tell them the good stuff about their kids No matter how stupid or bratty the kid is a year into our relationship our town started a motorcycle rally The three of us agreed to go together on Saturday after the tutoring students were done Bella reminisced about how her and Gios dad would motorcycle around Europe The next year this rally happened Gio was out of town in a business conference I was waitressing and he wanted me to just be at the business I told him I d only feel comfortable with that if taxes started being taken out or if she agreed to pay my taxes She agreed to pay me in cash I told Gio I would be keeping my job as a waitress because I made just enough to get free healthcare And liked getting a tax return to building savings He was good with it given those things back to the rally Gio and I both thought it was a good chance for her and I to bond We did nothing without Gio she was more focused on him herself It was a hot week she had been telling me to have the kids to drink water and watch for signs of dehydration I asked her if she was landscaping in this weather she said yes I let her know I hope she got everything done before it got too hot Friday she was complaining of a headache I asked if she was okay If the heat had possibly gotten to her I m fine and yes we ll go to the rally tomorrow Saturday morning the kids are dropped off and she comes in foul her and Gio got into that morning over our lack of bond Bella told him our lack of bond was my fault I didn t care to know anything about her Mom OP was the one to bring up the rally to me asking if I d think you d like to go walk it with her She s trying Just take care of the kids go on nice a walk and go home She sat in the office the whole time I knocked came in to let her know I ll change and we can go She looked drained like she didn t feel great I made the mistake of asking again if she felt up to going This was the hottest day of the week the rally wasn t in a shady spot and wind wasn t blowing It s okay I know you don t want to be seen with a fat old broad like me Grabbed her bag went out to her car I changed and closed the door I wasn t trusted to lock up She wasn t getting out of her car i walked over to talk with her Just go do whatever I don t want to talk to you Let her know I m sorry for offending her I just wanted to check she felt up to it cuz she d worked all week She didn t respond locked up got back in her car just get in your car so I can go soon enough Gio called I answered he went mamas boy letting me know had offended his mother and needed to apologize My repeated checking in had bothered and her feel unwelcome yet She also told him I had ignored her all day and canceled on her I told him what really happened what if he didn t believe me to go check the cameras and I don t appreciate getting yelled at without getting to tell my side He agreed my story sounded more real and he didn t need to check the cameras I told him 1 I was not going to fight with him about this 2 it ll be a long time before I try to do anything solo with her 3 I m not meeting them at the airport tomorrow He asked if we were done this was our first fight besides this he had always been a green flag I told him we can work through this but if things continue this way he cannot expect me to have a good relationship with his mom According to him she was sad I didn t met them at the airport and hoped everything was okay Getting to their business Monday I let him know I d be getting there with the kids due to work she was at the door looking actually happy til she noticed me walking through the parking lot I said good afternoon and you could tell she was upset I was there instantly It s been 10 plus years I still don t have a good relationship with her After that anytime I offered to do stuff 1 on 1 she never offered she turned me down Bella started turning down events with gio there cuz she didn t feel up to it Christmas had always been hard Putting up the tree cuz it s tradition Gifts were kept at a minimum too much made her ackward Christmas before we got married she got me a 23 and me dna kit I knew this was about seeing if I had dna from their home country I had just enough dna to make her happy thank god when the results came back While Gio is proud to be from his home country nothing to that level My folks mom factory job 12 hour shifts 3 days on and 4 days off next week it d switch my dad was on partial disability cattle ranch 2 hours a day At the start of Gio and I getting serious I spent half at home the days mom worked so I could care for dad and half with them Only after we married did I move in with them full time By then I had put in the paperwork for my dad an overnight nurse the days my mom worked Bella caused 3 scenes at our wedding 1st she drove them and was thirty minutes late to grandparents I know the way missed the exit cuz Gio was correcting her since she d only been to my grandparents twice in that five years 2nd she didn t want to be in pictures at all not family photos not a shot of her and Gio 3rd when she was ready to go she made it known to everyone Gio told her if you want to go go Op and I will be home later She was appalled we didn t leave with her Our wedding was a rush job my grandfather had cancer took a turn and it was if you want him at the event do it soon Honeymoon she called at every meal Gio gave her five minutes then found a reason to hang up Living with her I wasn t allowed to cook the stove oven heating element is off so it s really easy to burn food the fact her pots pans came with her from Europe she d be devastated if they were burned or scratched Given this Bella cooked all the meals I couldn t even cut vegetables Laundry could only be done on Sundays by her since The washer is old and knob is really picky I couldn t even wash my own clothes household cleaning also had to be done on Sunday She would complain that we treated her like a servant Gio would spend his Sunday cleaning and always took the trash out during the week without being asked Once she came in to me doing dishes seemed grateful I went to watch a movie with Gio in our room came out for snacks My clean dishes were back in the sink They still had spots on them they did not as I knew she d look for a reason to get upset Gio had heard the comment you always say we don t help out but when we do if it s not done exactly your way or when you want it you complain it s my house it should be done how I want and when I want to done This it s my house continued for the rest of our time there She had the master bedroom and chose to sleep on the couch We had to go through the living room to get through the bathroom at night this was a problem if we woke her up She refused to switch us bedrooms stating she needed her own space I worked as a waitress in the mornings and Sundays because she fought every chance for either business to grow I don t want to pay more in taxes what if he messes up As the owner I m liable This led me into missing dinner on Sunday was at work til 9pm I brought home my own dinner and a snack for Gio yes I checked she never wanted anything it s too salty opening and closing the togo boxes was too much for her one night he started taking food out of the boxes to microwave I came out to do you guys have to open and shut those boxes 50 times Man I can t even sleep in my house Gio went into explaining the situation of me being at work all day and deserving a warm meal I don t care you re both so noisy at night and always walking through the living room I can t sleep He reminded her you have a bedroom with a bathroom if you don t like your bed get rid of it put a couch and tv in there She proceeds to yell in their native language He tells her I m not doing this with you anymore It s your house you have made that clear We ll get our own place You dont have the money And I m not paying for it If I m not spending half the day occasionally landscaping for you then I can find an actual part time job that gives me steady hours You won t get hired anywhere and you won t like working for other people if you do It d be better than this and maybe we d get along as a family Whole conversation he s closing the togo boxes handing me them and plates he unplugs the microwave picks it up and nods towards his bedroom Thus began the home search It took weeks of figuring out our budget for a place since she refused to hand over his business or tell us exact how much money was being made That makes you think moneys being made I m not even giving myself a paycheck I told him okay let s base this off my checks the waitressing and the cash from the after school care Worse case the plasma clinic always wanted donors to make up the difference We could have easily gotten an apartment especially with my savings from Covid During the lockdown I didn t buy anything other than foo the restaurant had to sign us up for relief aide Since I wasn t paying her rent cuz family doesn t do that I had a good amount saved he wanted to help I told him good luck They fought over moving out It s too much money you won t be able to afford rent and food and I don t want to be alone His answers was simple you and I fight daily You don t get along with OP Something has to change since it s not going to be your attitude it s got to be our living arrangement What do you expect me to do not live in my house That s the problem it s your house not ours yours If we want to make chicken nuggets in the oven at 2am we should be allowed too If we want to wash clothes mid week we should be allowed too We need our space as much as you need yours you can help us find a place or we are going with the cheapest place possible to make sure we got money to cover everything She finally relented the only benefit to having her controling finances was his credit score Talking drive a new car off the dealership lot just by signing paperwork then the issues no renters history because she didn t charge rent and no utilities in his name Loans and everything else the bank said was great but wouldn t give him a mortgage on a house Why a mortgage on a house vs an apartment you ask she convinced him rather pay the bank than a landlord that could kick you out for no reason Our state didn t have great renters rights I told him since no bank would let us mortgage an apartment was our only option He said we could always have the house in his mom s name and us pay her I told him if we do that she ll hang it over our heads we are still living in her house she d find away to put the bills in her name she d never get a lease agreement written and she ll never sign the house over He said that happens we ll find some way to cut ties Someone get me a medal cuz I called it We moved in October 2021 The house needed minor repairs but we finally had our own space I wasn t allowed to paint one bathroom as she had to bring in a plumber to finish the shower and an electrician cuz if you plugged anything in the lights dimmed and flickered Those guys never got hired We got some water damage didn t hire anyone to fix the roof I don t call laying down fresh shingles fixing the roof until we had a move out date for the cross country move TW February 2022 we found out we were pregnant I was super happy to not be living with her something in me screamed something was wrong I told Gio how I felt asked if we could just keep this to his mom and my parents as I didn t want to tell people incase He agreed I told him he had better stay on his mom We told our parents on Saturday Monday evening I caught her telling parents when they commented I looked tired Remember we don t want to tell a lot of people especially since we know nothing yet I know I know I just get excited I was excited Gio was excited did she really think we didn t want to tell people everyone knew because she told them before we had our first doctor s appointment We went to the doctors appointment and didn t get good news they said there s a small chance they caught us early and baby was still developing but I knew we had miscarried Gave it a week and they confirmed it My body refused to give up the fetal tissue to the point I had to have a surgery we grieved I took a week off work because I just couldn t be around the kids I came back and she hadn t said anything to anyone Everyone assumed I was having morning sickness needed time to adjust hey mommy how we feeling Conversations kept happening end of the day I locked myself in the bathroom to cry before we went home Bathroom was right next to the office Bella what s the matter with her I had miscarriages you re the only baby I brou ght to term I walked out of the bathroom Did you have someone telling people you were pregnant Even though you asked that person not too You took the joy of me getting to share our news And replaced it with pain of having to tell them no You had a week I know people probably came to ask how I was doing since I wasn t here You can tell them the good news but left me to tell them the bad I m not coming in the rest of the week so you can tell everybody you talked to the news Grabbed my stuff went out the door without waiting for a response Yes I stayed home that week Yes Gio supported me and told people when they asked him No she didn t tell anyone the bad news I ignored her presence civil when we had to interact This was til December 2022 when we found out we were pregnant again I told Gio let him have a few hours to enjoy the feeling then asked what we d do about his mom Cuz i didn t want to have to go through that again He said we d wait til to see when the scheduled us for an appointment first Appointment being a month out and the morning sickness already hitting we had no choice We agreed I go to work when I felt up to it I took leave from the restaurant Got diagnosed with extreme morning sickness and a health baby at the appointment Gio and I still asked everyone to please let us be the ones to share the news My parents not a problem Bella she might have told a few of the more concerned parents I ll admit I got to tell a lot more people this time But she still broke a boundary I was just keep it civil Now we always closed for spring break Gio was trying for a big revamp especially with a baby on the way He had a cat and everyone will tell you pregnant ladies can t clean the litter Bella came over daily there was no how you feeling I already knew what baby shower theme I wanted was diying decor I set out my projects hoping she d ask nope didn t say anything It was like she was ignoring our pregnancy She waited til the last day when she caught me and mom coming back from grocery shopping to ask if I needed anything Told my mom baby comes I ll get a part time job just to make sure they are taken care of Bella swears she never said this what happened was the straw that set me in permanent civil mode as Gio was fine being his version of LC but can t bring himself to go full NC Day of the anatomy ultrasound got in there tech asked and we wanted to know It s a boy My dad was at the ranch so he got a text My mom napping after a 12 hour shift so text Bella knew when the appointment was roughly when we d be done He asked if he could call since she wasn t a big texter I told him to go ahead This B I m picking out plants with a customer I ll call you back and hangs up Even I wasn t expecting that Gio was devastated We went to go get milkshakes our tradition after appointments I asked him what he wanted to do he said she can call me when she cares She had ruined the moment for us we got home and she called him he was outside talking with her in the native language for hours When he was done we just cuddled on the couch To the baby shower I went with a cafe theme table for three cuz we had Italian for our first date we had a sandwiches pasta bar Italian desserts grape juice for wine ect We agreed to have it at the after school care center in our common room Since we were doing it on a Saturday I showed up on Friday did crafts with the kids and decorate Mil asked are you sure you want to do this You cant honestly be expecting a lot of people I was pissed because no matter the crowd I wanted to celebrate I worked hard on the event for us I was doing it I sent out texts calls and a Facebook event According to just Facebook we had 30 people say they d come and another ten say maybe That s not including my family and people that don t have facebook I organized it so the kids could play games while the adults chatted Food is going to be buffet style made sure everybody know they can pop in say hi then go about their day She stared at me and finially said it just seems like a way for you to get free baby stuff and that just doesn t seem right to me before he could say anything the words came out of my mouth they say it takes a village raise a child Sometimes the most supportive members aren t the ones related to you she had ignored our pregnancy ignored our baby updates and now wanted us to cancel the shower so she didn t have to deal with people Gio ask earlier what she wanted us to tell people when she wasn t there She really didn t want to come I m not saying throw money at us cuz we are having a baby but at least acknowledge the updates Of course my words hit a cord what time does it start tomorrow 11am a lot of people said they d be in when we get started We will be coming early to finish set up With that she left As soon as the door shut behind her I turned to Gio If she causes a scene tomorrow I will tell her to leave She s got two strikes that I ll damage control then throw her out myself He was also upset knowing how much work I had everyone shows up at 11am minus her she walks in at 11 15 sour look on her face seeing people slams the office door Gio nods I knew the angry hushed tones he left the office and for an hour she behaved herself It came time for gifts we sat and she had to put herself right next to Gio my mom was snapping away at pictures When he pointed out if she stayed there she d be in pictures she bolted We got maybe three pictures of her total Btw if you re wondering about her gift there wasn t one Gifts done kids playing games people snacking we wanted one family photo Bella ran to the office to get her camera 10 years I have only ever seen 5 pictures ever taken with this camera She insisted on taking the photo vs being in it One of the moms even said she d take the picture with that camera and my phone Gio it ll be really hard to explain to your grandson one day why you aren t in this picture Tone read get in the picture or leave She got in the picture again said no one wants to see a fat ugly broad Guests left food packed up I wanted to sit for a second before we took down decor She started a cleaning rampage If you give me a second I ll tell you want needs to be packed away and what can be trashed Oh let s just take it down go home and sort it later Because I m the one that has to sort it and honestly I don t want to do that Trash can here works just fine She scoffed and kept going mom enough It s not being helpful it s creating more work If you want to leave leave we handle it and I ll come clean tomorrow If I help it ll go faster and we can clean together today and you can unpack it all tomorrow I was done got up started packing what I wanted to keep The rest goes in the trash she looked at me like I was crazy You re trashing all this But you worked so hard on it I did work hard on it but it s served its purpose and since we are having a baby we don t have room for everything anymore This B proceeds to grab a bag and start collecting things she wanted to keep I sat back down Gio imma load the car If you want to go anywhere or pick up anything please let me know I kept my eyes on his mother I m good for the day some people just can t help themselves and ruin my mood Nightly phone call between him and Bella that night was again outside in their native language Onto the delivery we told my mom She was actually on her way to sit with me while gio landscaped with Bella He called and told her I ll work and be there after a shower labor is a long process Getting to the hospital my mom called everyone else Gio more worried about me than what his mom said developing a she ll get here when she gets here attitude I labored for five hours she still hadn t shown up according to my mom Everyone else was there even some friends were there in the waiting room Once there again she was pissed she wasn t the first one Doubling down when she heard I had just delivered it being the golden hour I told the nurses no one is allowed in End of the golden hour Gio went to ask friends to come back tomorrow they all obliged Family was allowed in my parents over joyed my grandmother tears Bella wouldn t hold baby boy I m all awkward in these situations My brain went no crap out loud I managed not to comment My dad and grandma left My mom went to get us dinner Bella stayed baby boy holding her finger in his crib She asked when he was going to the nursery we told her he s not He s not leaving this room Nurses came in she refused to break away from baby And started talking to the nurses about time in the nursery vaccines and circumsision Things Gio and I had already discussed and talked about with the staff I looked at Gio it was obvious I wanted her to shut up But he couldn t get her to Eventually I looked at a nurse what looked like she was over it too I nodded she came over can I have my baby please She looked way too happy to take baby from crib and give him to me Bella left shortly after called Gio that night I was so proud to hear mom we had already talked about all that together and with the staff If cared to talk about our decisions regarding our son before his birth you should have asked Next year August 2022 2023 is really easy to condense for you Bella came over to our house twice in the first two months Both times less than 30 minutes because baby was asleep Eventually guilted Gio it s a long drive wasn t even 20 minutes he s always asleep he s a newborn and I feel awkward I wanted the complaints to stop if you want to take him over that s fine but it won t change anything She ll still complain and probably not even hold him we went dinner and a quick movie She had dinner ready hated the fact Gio ate first I had him eat first so they could have playtime and I could eat in peace She chose to sit at the table watching Gio hold baby while I ate Went to go watch a movie she wanted to watch something new I pointed out if he s up and fussy no one s going to be able to catch anything we settled for something we had watched before I gave baby his bottle after I offered for her to feed him she said no then once he started getting sleepy decided she wanted to hold him She held him for about 30 minutes as he slept Then he woke up was immediately back to me no attempt to soothe him herself We did this twice each time a week later it was back to complaining about not seeing baby and wanting us to stay longer One day Gio wanted to give me a rest day he d do all the baby duties and I could just relax He quickly realized just how much work went into caring for a baby We talked about it later that day yeah you didn t even have to pack the diaper bag prep the bottle get him dressed get yourself ready none of that for when we go to your moms He realized then she should be coming to us if she wanted to see baby She refused cancelled and tried getting us to come over last minute I didn t work at the after school care anymore cuz the kids wanted to treat him more as a baby doll than an actual baby This continued til baby was 6 months old that was the next trip to her house She didn t hold him didn t feed him just like the pregnancy basically ignored I sent pictures videos of milestones and just happy baby moments oh how cute he s growing so fast I wish I could see this in person or just a basic emoji was the response No checking in how I was doing no Christmas gift for baby but guilt tripping that she didn t get to see baby Baby s birthday one party at our house for family and another at a restaurant to catch up with friends Our house she took Gios time by talking in hushed tones in the corner and standing in the way He almost missed the smash cake photos and presents cuz of her I had scheduled party times to be right between naps She wasn t invited to the restaurant but somehow came anyway We were opening gifts she came running up is this a scam Shoving her phone in gios face during cake she decided to go play the arcade game in the corner I told him I m done she s ruined yet another event I m change him and then we ll have to go it s almost nap time the after school care building was leased the roof started leaking before baby s birthday Leaking got so bad she called the landlord Come to find out he d let the insurance on the building lapse and she never had any on anything but the business Given that insurance couldn t be involved they agreed to get it fixed out of pocket Landlord had been a roofer back in the day Well he went to work didn t put any weather proofing down a section of the ceiling collapsed in after a rain storm Lucky it was before kids came in and left that room locked It took them six months to fix the roof with no leaks no gaps no accidental skylights During this entire time the business was hemorrhaging money We Gio and I were stressed she seemed bothered but not overly worried Gio couldn t watch baby so I could work because he was working morning and afternoon with her landscaping coming home for lunch and then leaving to go teach in the evening He had a friend that moved out of state cross country actually to be around family The friend offered Gio a job his business had three smaller rooms and a common area they didn t need Figured with the roof caving in no one offering after school care in his area they could combine forces This offered burned in gios pocket for a bit he didn t like the idea of moving from coast to coast just cuz of a landlord that couldn t get the roof fixed a business that was failing and his mom fighting him on every chance to improve the business Said it wasn t fair to me my folks or baby My folks would never get on a plane it d take them a few extra days drive due to my dad s health to visit and they d have to make sure my mom had enough vacation days basically zero chance of them ever visiting I know what you re thinking just pick up more landscaping customers Bella refused on grounds again she was the business owner and didn t want to be liable if he made mistakes Gio brought up getting his own LLC and customers working morning afternoons on days she didn t paying her rent on her tools and consulting fees as needed She told him you ll be competing with long standing businesses with bigger work crews so more availability for customers He asked if she d let him take over her last three customers when they are done I m done and what I get from them is barely enough to keep my house going All that being said it was the move or find something else completely better the devil you know he knows how to run build and operate an after school program Even better without Bella standing in the way baby boy turned one and we decide to move My folks were pissed but said they understood yeah no they didn t understand they are currently LC minus unless I send pictures videos of the baby everyone turned toxic Gio went out to see before we moved the whole family Facility was perfect for what we needed There were kids that would join the program when it started Lease agreement Gio could be added too His friend was even willing to let us run the program three months rent free to make sure we were good Gio gave me the okay I started downsizing donating packing with a toddler and no steady help I didn t feel great one day and recognized how I felt Took the test I was pregnant We always said we wanted two kids close in age so they could bond and do things together Originally plan was to wait til our first was 2 well our first turns 2 years old 2 months after his sibling is born This didn t make anyone feel better about the move My folks more upset and uncomfortable Bella came to take care of the cat litter and I m so busy never stayed to watch baby boy so I could pack or shower never asked about cravings or if I needed anything My mom came over her days off minimum hour so I could shower and us eat Max two hours so we could eat and I could pack a little This cycle continued for the three months All with getting diagnosed with extreme morning sickness to the point I lost ten pounds I didn t see Gio at all my first trimester minus daily video chats Now we decided to drive taking the important belongings baby stuff and putting the rest in storage We only had the one car and Gio had drove it out to the other coast so he didn t have to rent He thought our support system would do its job I had minimal support my grandmother she was the rockstar Twice a week for five hour stints she d come baby sit the toddler so I could pack Bella was dropping off donations and taking stuff to our storage unit Gio had her put on the lease for the storage unit so she could have access to it Plan was to transfer her the monthly fees and shipping costs Gio had found out one of the former after school families was planning a trip to the same city we were moving to Brought this up this is where stuff went sideways She brought up paying the dad to drive the Uhaul and us fly She d keep our cat didn t like us paying pet fees plus a pet and two kids in an apartment Saying this would be so much easier since OP is pregnant and baby boy won t have to sit in this car seat the whole time I told Gio I d still rather us drive so I can hurl was needed sleep bring our cat and keep baby boy away from airport germs If anything still pay that dad to drive the Uhaul and us rent an suv to take everything in one go He liked this idea looking at all the costs Bella pushed her idea I didn t like this idea Eventually between doing everything I told Gio I m out I m done so long as I m with you where I m actually heard I don t give a poop we ended up flying Bella the dad and the next door neighbors loaded the Uhaul I put the toddler in his play pen and slid boxes towards the door Daily life stuff first apparently this took all the room Bella wouldn t allow me out the door to look and see if I had any boxes that could fit Baby items home decor knick knacks ect left behind for her to take to the storage unit later There s no room left You ll have to visit to get the rest and the cat or I ll ship it to you Moving truck leaves giving me a few days more with my folks and to label storage unit boxes Gio came in on an evening flight Picked up me baby boy and the cat up to stay the night at his mom s We left the next morning via plane We arrived and got to our apartment a hours before the moving truck Upon the moving truck getting there opening the moving truck we found out it was only half full We had plenty of room for the baby stuff Gio and I were pissed but we aren t due til May It was November The dad said he thought it was odd we didn t use every last bit of space but Bella told him that was everything we were taking I immediately looked at Gio he told me he d handle it All the boxes brought in toddler in play pen I started talking things out of boxes Bella called him shortly after her response to why there was still room on the truck well you said you were coming back for Christmas I thought you d pick up the rest and the cat then I said we d try and that just means we d have to fly in get a rental and drive across country like we originally had planned vs flying in and out The visits home flying between locations would have made more sense I knew we should have stuck to our plan of driving to get everything else here Well you got the important stuff she snapped Really What about the baby stuff Op didn t give that to us to put on the truck Mom I m calling bs You told him that s all we are taking You told her there was no room left So we literally have nothing for baby number two here Well then I ll ship it to you and you can grab the cat when

text body: Hi I 20f live with my mother we re going through a tough financial situation because my mother has a restaurant that was successful for a while but now is in debt because my mom decided to buy a little cabin in a mountain that we never use because it s very far away instead of paying off debts due to said debts the bank repoed her car and she had to get into more debt to get it back to make a long story short she s owes 5 months of rent now and can pay it off if she sells her car but she doesn t want to Now to get to the start of my issue due to this I had to get a full time job while balancing uni to pay por my uni expenses excluding the semesters payment I make about 500 usd a month and I save 250 and use 250 for the houses WiFi my cellphone some groceries and my social outings I m able to do this because I budget really well and take public transport from my house to uni My mom also asks me for small amounts of money every now and then as a loan but she never pays it back but I don t charge her for them because I understand she s a single mother that s just made some bad decisions Recently my uni has been bugging me to pay my tuition we were supposed to pay it 2 months ago but the university is a bit flexible with payment times But now since there was no payment they have eliminated me as a student and I can t attend classes anymore I mentioned this to her since she promised that she was gonna support me all through college and she said that she would see what strings she could pull so she could pay that off Before I get to the next point I want to mention that my mother payed for my sister college until she got pregnant and dropped out after that she proceeded to pay for her rent for about a year and regularly bought my nephews groceries and clothes She also payed for multiples certifications for my sister like a nail makeup and eyelash course for her to work on but my sister never made a business out of that at the end For the record I always helped baby sit for her at least 2 3 times a week for about 4 hours each at my mother s request Today I caught my mother and sister talking behind my back my sister was urging my mother to not pay for my college tuition and to let me pay it for myself since I have a job now The thing is that If my mom made some lifestyle changes like eating out less or shopping less or stop visiting her boyfriend and flying out to other cities she would be able to make the monthly payments for my tuition I on the other hand would have to dedicate 100 of my salary for 4 months to pay for my tuition without including external costs like transportation and food Also my grandmother payed for my last semester since my mom couldn t make the payment I would like to highlight that I m a straight A student I don t cause any problems at home and help out with the restaurant when possible For this reason I would like advice to help convince my mother to keep her promise of helping me through school",20.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: To start off I want to apologize for my poor choice of words English isn t my native language Concerning the issue I have to face regarding my mom my mom is the most dramatic person in my life I used to be a very anxious child when I was younger Looking back my mothers attitude definitely fed into it because she too like me is a very nervous person at times However I don t want to blame her for it but I still wish she would have at least tried to behave a bit more mature to calm me down My desire for a man in my life I m a homosexual man with daddy issues that takes care of me and helps me calm down when stressed or sad definitely steams from the lack of comfort in my childhood when I needed the guidance and reassurance of a grown up but instead only ever got to hear someone as nervous if not even more nervous than me break down I m 17 years of age now and my mother still acts that same way I ve learned to think more clearly and calmly when stressed and not to rely as much on my moms words as before Most of the times now I just roll my eyes and let her complain and yell histrionically However that dramatic nature of hers twists the truth very often making it hard to know what a certain situation really looks like Sometimes my mother will describe baggages as unbelievably heavy to me and that no man is able to carry them they may be a bit heavier to her than me but they are still humanly possible very portable Other times she claims she ll arrive somewhere in about 2 minutes but really needs about 15 minutes I m ill at the moment and my mother throws a constent tantrum about how dangerous my sickness is It really isn t and I keep on trying to explain to her that I m feeling well and a lot better but she won t listen to me at all She always assumes I m taking drugs or doing something illegal out with my friends even though I have never done anything of that sort I can t let anything happen to me because she ll act like the worlds about to end This is why I stopped telling her about certain things and started to lie I cannot handle her anxiousness any longer She twists the truth and I cannot believe her She knows that she s lying but she s addicted to speak in hyperbole I desire someone in my life as a guiding role that speaks the truth that does not let their feelings consume them entirely that can tell me the truth the plain truth not twist it so it seems unbearable I need someone to calm me I know that my desire is just a wish and that there is no such person But I need for once in my life my mother to tell me just the state of the matter to listen to what I say so we can both overcome our anxiousness and work together",17.0,male,son,10-19

text body: Me 25M and my brother 30M had a relatively normal upbringing and were very close My brother growing up was always a pretty chill guy cool to hang to out with and a great sense of humor but there was one thing he had a dormant anger problem He and our Dad his stepdad loved each other but definitely had plenty of issues through the years when it comes to discipline He would challenge my our Dad s authority sometimes and it would pose more of a problem the older we got Eventually he went to the military but would get kicked out after a year for getting caught smoking weed He moved back in with me and our parents for what I m sure they thought would be a short time He would bounce from job to job would eventually stop looking for work all together much to our Dad s dismay Tension would build up between them while I was away at college nothing ever went further than an argument Our parent s eventually decided that he either needed to find a place or move with our Grandmother who was living with us for a couple years choosing the latter He has been living with our grandmother for the past 3 years now and she never pressed him to go get a job or do much of anything He has become reclusive and doesn t speak a lot unless spoken to and when he does talk sometimes he ll say stuff that doesn t make a whole lotta sense His anger issues have become much worse in that timespan as well One day he and my father finally came to blows after an argument in front of our Grandmother He s spent a night in jail for fighting a random stranger has disrespected other family members and has even cursed out our mother who has done nothing but love and support him even after the issue with our Dad Finally yesterday I took him and our grandmother grocery shopping since he doesn t have a car After we left the store she wanted to me stop for some food he started to get upset because he had some Ice Cream and was concerned it would melt even though the place we were going was a couple miles away He screamed and cursed at me to let him out of the car at a light in a busy intersection I was completely stunned because he never spoke to me like that and over something insignificant was insane to me He looked like he wanted to kill me in that quick instance before he walked off my grandmother was also pretty unsettled by this I fear his mental state is deteriorating he used to be a very fit guy he s lost weight and is skinny now and locks himself in a room and doesn t talk to anyone My mom has repeatedly try to set him up somewhere on his own but he keeps refusing to get a job and curses at anyone who tries to tell him what to do so it never works out My Dad is basically done with him as well I ve been caught in the middle and I m not sure what needs to be done here I m kind of nervous about him living with our grandmother now after seeing he can snap like that Sorry for the long story I condensed as much as possible",25.0,male,brother,20-29

text body: I 17F geniuenely dislike it when my cousin 23M gets handsy with me For context My cousin from my mom s side is a special needs from what I ve heard my aunt went in labor early 7 months during her pregnancy with my cousin One of the issues during his birth led to him having a needle through his eye or something as well as having a brain dysfunction I think I kept asking my parents or relatives what his disability is but they keep saying that there s something wrong with his brain their words not mine because of this everyone from my mom s side pampers coddle and baby him Emphasis on BABY cause I m not joking the way they talk to my cousin is exactly how one would talk to a toddler with Cousin s name don t do that that s bad and stuff like that But it s not the reason why I came here to reddit it s mostly because of how my cousin gets physically affectionate with me and how my family brushes me off My cousin has this weird habit of sniffing my hair at random times and sometimes he touches my thighs and it makes me uncomfortable I also told some stories to my friends and when they told me how weird it was that was when I realized my cousin has done some weird things and my family enables him sometimes One of these incidents is that up until I was 12 13 my cousin has this weird tendency to only pull up his shorts pants outside bathroom because of this I ve grown used to seeing my cousin s weiner out and when I mentioned this to my mom she told me it was in the past and to pardon my cousin cause he s a special case I just hate how when my cousin acts out they just either let him or scold him lightly and if he doesn t listen they just don t bother I ve witnessed countless of times of my cousin acting out and breaking things from glass tables glass doors and etc and this kind of led me to grow paranoid over the years and up until I was 15 right after quarentine he s been randomly appearing behind me to sniff my hair and whenever we sit next to each other example sitting next to each other in the car he ll just caress my thigh and whenever I tell him to stop that my aunt or mom just tell me to stop and let him be or in my mom s case pinch me on the arm waist",17.0,female,cousin,10-19

text body: 25M here from somewhere in Asia and I m still living with my parents as a single child Since I was a kid I ve always had to deal with my mom She s a foreigner and moved to my country with my dad after I was born After coming to to this country she refused to work saying that her English was terrible and refusing to learn any English or make more friends here hence becoming a housewife She took good care of me and my dad so I respect her decision and I m grateful for her All along however she had always been victimising herself insisting that she was scammed to come to our country with my dad and left her with no choice but to become a housewife and ruining her life hence refusing to work maintaining that it was impossible due to her English and refusing to take any steps to improve her own life even though she deeply laments her financial situation and exhibits very deep financial insecurity My dad has always allowed her to spend any money she wants Thankfully she s thrifty Often times excessively so to the point on skimping on hawker centre meals or simple luxuries well within our means As I ve grown up and slowly become independent it s evident that she has become increasingly insecure She often mentions how filial my cousins living in her home country are even though they stay away from their parents and only visit home once every few months Yet me staying with her every day seems to be the villain and not filial enough often insinuating using my cousins despite taking time almost every day to talk to her eat with her and help her with what she needs She also very often complains how I m not listening to her about how my wings have gotten hard and that I don t need her any more Even as a kid whenever something doesn t go her way she d always threaten Then I ll leave Of course this is the tip of the iceberg Frankly as an adult I can still find the trauma she s left in me in every part of my life Back during COVID she spent a lot of time complaining that my dad and I weren t following her unreasonably strict sometimes outright paranoid hygiene rules and some of that continues even today We went for a family trip last year which for the most part became very ugly due to her and my dad bickering over very petty things and ruining most of the joy Both my parents were in the wrong for the most part This year I decided that I d travel alone and I told my parents about it They weren t opposed to it initially they probably know I really want to do this and don t really care and I booked the trip anyway Subsequently she asked for which dates I m going and I told her to which she has been throwing a huge tantrum chastising me for not consulting with her and abandoning her for the trip I can t understand why I have to consult her for my own travels using my own money She compared me to a cousin who rarely every goes home at all but recently asked her mom for the first time ever whether she d like to go overseas for a trip together I spoke to her sister my aunt who s far more reasonable and she believes that it s her deep insecurity rearing an ugly head based on what she knows of my relationship with my mom She knows how oppressed I ve ever felt due to my mom Thanks for reading this rant If you ve got any advice on what I should do I really appreciate it",25.0,male,son,20-29

author: CALADRIUS727
text body: Warnings mentions of sexual abuse pedos incest So for background information I told my father whom im estranged to now back in i think 2023 2024 about my grandfather molesting me when I realized it would be revealed as my dad was looking through his ex fiance s messages off topic story and he ended up calling the immediately family first my grandma then my grandfather then my aunt All of which were of course confused and shooken Why would she say something like that is my grandma s exact words And ofc there was denying and whatever Ended up with me telling the story five times This is how it goes although warning it happened a while back and my brain is foggy because I was trying my hardest to forget about it and believe my grandfather didn t mean bad by it Also because me my siblings and dad all were living in an RV on my grandpa s property and srsly relied on him so I felt like I couldnt say anything But anyway it was back when I was 14 im currently 18 turning 19 when the first time it happened We were alone it was snowing heavily down by the garage and my grandfather was talking about me needing more love he s aware my father is abusive and mother out of the picture And so he was behind me and hugged me from behind which isnt too odd until he had his face in my neck and putting his arms up my shirt and jacket and groped my chest Ofc I was shocked and froze not knowing what to do Mind you I was never given a talk the most talk I ever got was to not talk to strangers I was really good at pretending though and he d asked me are you okay I think Mind you Im also reveiwing when i told my online ex best friend like a month after it happened bc i was scared to even tell my online friends But i replied with eh No not really like in a quiet voice and sorta walked off I cant remember too well but between the first time and the last time he has always been a bit too open with sex talk or would sometimes grope me a little or maybe press himself a bit too much when we rode the quad I tried my hardest to not act differently I think it was because i didnt want to get into trouble i always remember feeling like i was gonna get caught lying or smth However at some point grandpa hadnt done it in a while and i thought that i could forget and move on But i stupidly thought that didnt knock on wood obviously on the same day last day we went driving And he was a good teacher gentle and nice but on this drive things got crazy And no i havent gotten past my self blame stage even if i try to deny it so here goes im 15 at this point turning 16 That day i was practicing driving till we got to the town where grandpa took over and we went to get some ice so while we got some we messed around a bit and i put ice down his shirt cause im stupid and was having fun But then he said ho ho just wait im going to get you wet and ofc at first i didnt think about it in thattt way Then i did I remember how my body went cold and i was uncomfortable But i went on and drove Drove till grandpa wanted a smoke break and and we parked at this vet park we stopped at a couple times before While at the rest stop i dont remember a lot but i remember his tickling me and at first it was playful but then he held me down with my back on the middle console as im sitting in the driver seat his elbow keeping my torso down he does a lot of maual labor hes stronger than me im just a chubby girl and he ended up slipping his hands under into my pants and touched me for a couple of seconds I tried to kick and say no multiple times screaming it My instincts kicked in though ofc and he got off me and was laughing and i was too Trying to laugh at least even when i was tearing up I pretended like nothing happened and drove back home Ended up sobbing in the Rv then doing what i usually did Pretending So after i told my dad he was a child about it and used the fact i didnt trust him enough to tell him but told his ex fiance to maybe keep him away bc he visited our new home in every argument we have that we moved in a couple of months after grandpa molested me last He a couple times also almost nearly said i lost my relationship with my father because ofc you can assume what he would say next as he always loved to compare me to my maniulative psychotic mother Always calling me a liar yet swears up and down he believes me about my grandpa Which doesnt mean anything to me because they have a sour relationship based on codependency and drugs that always ends up with hate My dad talked shit about everyone in the family teaching me and my sisters no one else loves us or can care for us So we believed him because no one reached out Not the point the point of this post is with the information i give you and am happy to answer questions is how i should react to my families response to this all since i have moved out from my fathers place after a desperate call to my aunt for help after the millionth time my dad threatened to kick me out because well thats also another story but lets just say its money he wants A lot of it But yes im living with my aunt now a girl who spent middle and high school online So social skills are 0 Basically my aunt chooses to not talk about it I forgot what she exactly said but its like she is choosing to side step it Shes got enough drama and I m very grateful to her But so she has informed after the talks we have had which is the first time i was able to have a normal 2 sided talk with someone without being screamed at And she told me how my grandpa has been doing drugs for a long time probably with my dad too But my grandpa mainly did weed and she beleives that my grandpa wouldnt be capable of doing what he did to me without the drugs messing up his brain Which i totally understand where she could think that because i seriously loved my grandpa he was my rock and ended up becoming a boulder rolling onto me Very ill relationship with driving now and my body She also makes it a point that pedos would be noticed from a younger age than how old he is That he wouldve started with her his daughter and by no means did i agree with this But ofc i love my aunt and all that we dont need to agree with everything but she does not wish to say whether she does or doesnt believe me And instead insists that the matter is one to simply not speak of I should also mention she was molested by a rando when she was younger and thats why i felt like she may relate But i have discovered incest feels much different Anyway my aunt still talks to my grandma and grandpa grandma still lives with him and they all seem fine Like nothing has ever happened Heard his voice a couple times and it made me ill i cover photos on the fridge with my grandpas face in it with magnets I try to avoid him completely but the reason i was having a discussion with my aunt to begin with was because she was trying to advise me to talk to my grandma especially bc she didnt dk anything to hurt me Cant go on to tell my aunt my grandma used to make snide comments to me and my little sister about our chubbiness Never did it to the middle sis shes skinny i cant stack on smth else thats hearsay although my sis would attest The issue is i have decided to not speak to my grandma but after my aunt put me in a situation where i had to speak to her showing my art while on videocall even though i said no theb showing me she thinks that im fine with it now and has bombarded me twice since and i try to be polite but worried my grandpa is listening Before this abd the convo i always went upstairs when i heard their voice and refused to speak and aunt did a good job saying i wasnt feeling well or doing smth I appreciate her for understanding But she also doesnt want me saying anything about my grandpa or setting boundaries if i were to talk to her Which i think first is a red sign second my aunt lied to me too After my aunt and her fought over the painting my aunt told me that my grandma offered 50 but i overheard her talking to her friend and said her dad offered it Which makes me feel like i cant trust her or my grandma about this situation Next thing i know she will try tk get me to talk to my grandpa which i brought up to ny aunt but she quickly said she wouldnt It makes my blood boil thinking about how grandfather got away scott free and no one else knows like its a hush hush situation I just dont know what to do I hate keeping the peace abd my family is the kind to say family comes first but it literaly never does to them All i know is my cousin tiny boy has seen him multiple times even after everything was revealed which is smth that angers me to the point of snapping especially because i saw them on a quad which ny grandpa was a bit touchy a couple times on and is one of the photos on the fridge Like shes risking her son Also uou should know my grandpa and dad have the same name and once when i was around 14 before my dad got a call about some sexual assult on a girl and he was with his ex fiance then gf and very confused which he mentioned later on when i admitted everything but also his ex fiance told me before he did Also beterrn the time i admitted what happened and when i called my aunt to help i didnt get much contact from my family less than before was alr little Thats it rlly would appreciate feedback Thanks and sorry for the long post I got away from my dad though hope yall take that as a sign that things can turn around for the better",18.0,female,granddaughter,10-19

text body: Hi everyone I m a 20 year old female and I m dealing with a tough situation in my family I hope some of you might be able to offer some perspective or advice To give you some background I have a disabled mom and last year my siblings decided to kick her out of the house Their reasoning was that they couldn t deal with her toxicity anymore and they felt burdened by her financial situation We re a Filipino family and there s this whole utang na loob dynamic where we re taught to always be grateful for what our parents did for us But growing up I ve seen my mom struggle to provide for us and despite her efforts she s always been pretty hard to deal with My mom has multiple illnesses and the worst of them is a broken lumbar 1 which really affects her mobility I have two other sisters but one is single and works hard to help provide for mom while our older sister has her own family and doesn t want to be involved My brother also has his own family and doesn t want to help either One of my sisters has a mental disability so the responsibility of taking care of our mom largely fell on my sister Val and me I ve always seen Val working tirelessly to support our mom even though mom never really appreciates it She s always negative and never acknowledges how hard Val works Last year Val finally had enough and kicked mom out After that I had to put my education on hold and get a job to take care of my mom because nobody else would help Since then my entire family blocked me and I haven t been able to contact any of them Now I m stuck in this situation trying to care for my mom and figure out if what my siblings did was justified I get that they have their own families and lives to handle but leaving me here to deal with everything on my own feels overwhelming So my question is Is what they did right Did they do the right thing by cutting me off and leaving me with the responsibility Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated Thanks",20.0,female,daughter,20-29

text body: Ok last year my sister and father tried put me in jail well first off my father has mental health issues and whenever our mother passed away me and my sister decided that since our father lived closer to me that I would take care of his finances not like a poa just to make sure he pays his bills etc and since my dad has mental issues he would always think others were always out to get him which is part of his illness and would always call me at odd hours of the day or just plain complaining about his neighbors which none of it were true and when I would reach out to my sister who lives 3 hours away would just say oh I can t do anything to help like all the responsibilities were on my shoulders and I felt like I was replacing my mom who for some reason loved the man to death even with his disability I just felt like he was more of an burden to me than a father And now that I have 2 small children it was harder for me to go check on him or take him grocery shopping it was always a struggle so finally after do this for 10 years and having 2 kids it was to beginning to take a toll on my mental health and a stain on my marriage and my sister would never in the 10 years ever come to visit us or our dad but would always complain about the way I handled things I always told her to please help me or please come visit to help but she would never she also has children and a husband let s not get into that with her husband lol anyways after she tried putting me in jail claiming I was stealing his SS money which I never did I had a job and my husband works full time we didn t need help financially But to my sister we were stealing and buying big flat tvs and vehicle which we weren t So am I the problem Should I reconnect with my sister I have forgiven my father because I know he s mentally unstable and can t help it So my question is reconciling with my sister the right thing to do or just continue keeping my distance Oh and since this has happened last year the part where she tried putting me in jail she has taken my dad to live closer to her and she put him in a group home Anyone have family issues My other family members think I m overreacting and should make the first step in reconnecting with my sister but every time I think of the lies she s told the police about all the mean and nasty things I so called did to our father",39.0,female,daughter,30-39

text body: I F20 am fed up of being the ungrateful daughter It s always You have to help your mother but never you should help your wife but somehow it always only refers to me not my little brother 15 At his age I also had to help around the house I know that times change but the fact that he doesn t even put his own plate in the dishwasher shows me that my brother is no different from my father 47 He can t even manage to put his plate in the dishwasher My mother has given in or rather given up She cleans up after my father as if she were his cleaner And just because I don t do the same I m suddenly the unthinkable and lazy daughter But I m exhausted I m tired of being the oldest daughter I m tired of having to clean up the kitchen every day to show my gratitude for my parents providing me with food and a roof over my head It s not that I m not grateful but I m tired of being seen as the ungrateful daughter every time I don t keep the whole house clean since I m not working right now I m tired of always having to clean up after everyone when they could do it themselves Just for reference the first picture is how my family leaves the kitchen and the second picture is how I leave the kitchen",20.0,female,daughter,20-29
