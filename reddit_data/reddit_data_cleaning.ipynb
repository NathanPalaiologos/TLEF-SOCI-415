We recently discussed potentially going to family therapy together but I’ve decided I don’t want to heal our relationship - I prefer a low contact relationship, how do I explain this? \n\nA few months ago She also apologised about something that hurt me deeply when I was a child, I thought we may actually begin to build bridges.

         "One day my dad was sick, he had a stomach flu and he asked me to grab him some grapes from Freshco which was a few minutes from our house. I couldn't drive at the time I was only 14 so I went to my cousins place (which was in our basement, there immigrants) She and her husband are both my cousins and were married with 2 kids (12 and 7) and I told her if she could take me there. She told me that my uncle was gonna take me (we call our older cousins uncle in terms of respect or wtv and he was around 37) and she had already called him. I got out the house and waited on the driveway for him to pull up and he did like a minute later. I opened the backseat to sit and he said \"No sit in the front with me\" I didn't think anything of it and just sat and i started getting a really weird feeling in my gut like it was a disgustingly bad feeling. We drove there and he parked he turned to me and started touching my thighs and kissing my head and pulling me closer and at the time i was in a state of shock and i didnt know what to do. He stopped for a moment and told me to go get the grapes i went in picked them up and started dreading going back. I felt bad to call my mom or tell someone so i sat back down and he started driving.. he told me to put my hand on his thigh near his crotch and  he started rubbing my thigh and started touching my chest and he did 3 laps around my house and never really got there.  He told me to kiss him and he persisted that i kissed him on the lips which was so disgusting i kinda looked at him and started crying (i was super scared) and he took me back home i wiped my tears and pretended like everything was fine and we both went to my dad who kinda looked at me weirdly and didnt say anything i dont blame him he didnt know. Fast forward a week later i was paranoid like super scared i had locked the doors both back and forth and would go upstairs and lock myself in my room everytime he would come over and I had cried myself to sleep every night. I didnt wanna tell anyone, he was a married man with 2 kids a wife and she was pregnant i felt sick to my stomach everytime i thought about it and one day my dad had pulled me aside and started questioning me he was super worried and after an hour i told him.. i could tell that something in him changed he looked pissed like to the point where i could tell he wasnt okay. a couple days later he came back to me and told me that i had two options we could call the police and report it or he could deal with him by himself kick him out from the basement make him apologize and not let a single soul know and i choose the second one because i didnt wanna ruin his relationship and he had kids what would they think? Its disgusting i know. He apologized and know one knows until now we have an ok relationship i usually never talk unless its a Hi and a Bye but it still haunts me and im scared to even interact with anyone from that side.\n\nHe did actually apologize and my dad had beat him up to and he never thought about doing it again. \n\n",

I only found out because my daughter was texting her cousin and she said she was painting her new walls in her room.\n\nI am just beyond shocked and pissed off. We bought our house in 2006 before the crash and at the time was half of my husband’s take home pay and we struggled for YEARS making sure our mortgage was paid and did without. And just to note- this is the same dad that made me come to his house and “plead my case” for $100 of grocery money when my husband lost his job and our son was a baby. He’s never done anything to help our family. Meanwhile, my brother was arrested in 2018, chose not to work for over 5 years and was given a truck and insurance by him.\n\nAnd a little background info- he is our adopted dad that adopted us from bio dad when I was 10 years old. He also has 2 bio kids of his own. Very negative and verbally abusive to us growing up and my brother claimed to hate him and even threw him into a pantry when he was a teen. I’ve distanced myself over the years due to hard feelings and SA that occurred by his father that was basically brushed off.",

         "My mum is nearly in her mid 60s, I’m 32M. I moved out 3 years ago and live with my girlfriend in a rented flat about 1 hour away. I visit my mum once a month or sometimes once every 2 months as I’m so busy with work. I run my own business so it takes up a lot of my time and I hardly have time to myself, even to spend with my girlfriend.\n\nMy mum lives alone as my dad has moved abroad a few years ago as he’s retired. She doesn’t work as she has health issues and arthritis which prevents her from working a physical job. She still asks me to help contribute money for her rent as she’s on benefits and struggles to pay the bills.\n\nSince I was living there and started working, I used to pay the rent to help out, but since moving out she’s still been asking me to do that. I didn’t mind, but now my finances are so stretched tight with so many expenses to pay and a rise in living costs, that I’m struggling to even pay for myself.\n\nShe’s always talking about her health issues which sometimes makes me feel sad. She sends me photos of her brothers who are going through health issues now and asks if I’ll ever take care of her when she’s ill as she lives alone.\n\nMy mum had me late and from what I see, normally when parents are of old age, their child is normally in their 40s. I’m only in my early 30s and still exploring life and trying to get my business together. I feel I’ve been given the stress early on as my mum had me late. If it was 10 years later it would be easier for me.\n\nI’m not sure what to do as my full focus is my business right now as I enjoy running it and working, but my mum always messages me with the sad stuff such as health related topics or bills overdue.\n\nWould love some advice.",

         "Before I begin, I want to say I don’t hate my parents, but I feel deeply let down by their selfish and neglectful behavior.\n\nMy family is far from perfect — they have a lot of psychological issues, and I understand that. They were raised in a harsh environment and experienced abuse as children. I went through my own cycle of unexplainable cruelty too.\nMy parents divorced in 2020 when I was 14 years old. My father suddenly disappeared from our home for months. It was during the COVID lockdown, and no one could leave the house. My mother told us about the divorce later.\nI don’t remember much from that year, but it was filled with pain. Since then, life has been hard. I’ve grown up with mental scars. I’m the eldest of three siblings. My second sister is only one year younger than me, and the youngest is 7 years younger. I was the one who really took care of the youngest and tried to give her attention during that rough time.\n\nTime passed, and in 2022, I changed a lot — and so did my family, but in a worse way. My mother started neglecting us even more, always going out with her friends and saying she “didn’t get to live her life” when she was married to my dad.\nShe started talking to men on the phone, and I couldn’t stand it. It was painful. As for my dad, every time we go out with him, it’s just orders and negative talk. I’ve been struggling with all of this, but I have to stay strong.\nHe travels abroad a lot and seems genuinely happy, and so does my mom. And when I talk to someone close about it, they say, “Don’t blame them, they didn’t get to live a healthy life because of early marriage.”\n\nBut what about me?\n\nWhen I ask my dad to take us on a trip, he says “later” and makes empty promises. Then suddenly, he goes off with his friends and travels. My mom does the same.\nI feel so much jealousy toward them. They enjoy life, spend money on themselves, and live with full freedom. But when I ask for a trip, my dad says it’s too expensive or makes some excuse. It’s honestly awful.\nI just want to go out and live a bit, but the control and selfishness are suffocating. There’s no clear reason for it .\n\nIn 2024, they were shocked when I was diagnosed with depression, suicidal ideation, bad habits, anger issues, and self-harm.\nAnd what happened after? My mother said things like, “I didn’t neglect you,” and kept trying to shift blame to avoid guilt.\nMy father blamed everything on my mom because we don’t live with him. Everything always goes in a bad direction.\n\nI want to go out with my friends. I want to live my life. But they’re so controlling and suspicious about everything. They say no to us, yet go to the same places with their own friends and leave us behind.\nI’m honestly thinking of becoming independent as soon as possible. But as the oldest brother, I feel like that would be selfish toward my sisters — they have no power and would be stuck in this toxic cycle.\nI’m really fed up with everything.\n",

         "hi everyone! Im desperate for answers. I really need help, like so bad. Questions are listed at the bottom. im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory, so this may be kinda long. I am 20 and my younger sister is 17. I am a college student. My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds (mom is white and dad is black). \n\nMy parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten. But, I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old, the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing. My dad was very involved in this sport; I needed to practice everyday, that’s reasonable! As I got older, this sport grew into a monster, I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play. So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches (1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse) so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age. There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3/4 summers straight, and every day after school was dedicated to practicing. I didnt mind this, but my mom is heavily dedicated to school. She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a’s in my all AP (advanced placement) classes. I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week. This was my life from ages 12-18. I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted, he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school, so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center. In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college. \n\nOnce I left for college in 2023, I decided I was going to major in computer engineering. My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them. I ended up doing okay my first semester, but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes, leading to my suspension from the university. I was in over my head in all of my classes. My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college, never asking about my mental health. Only cared about my grades and told me to do some “soul searching”. I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic. Now that its been a year, im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December. \n\nSince quitting sport (which was my dads thing), and failing school (which was my moms thing) i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me. When I was 16, i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima, which I was EXTREMELY grateful for, took great care of and love it. I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me. I pay for my rent, gas money, and groceries, which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying. Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years.\nBut….\nMy sister, who is 17, got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year. She has no pressure to be in any AP classes, she doesnt have a job, she doesnt play sports. She has no pressures in life, which has set her up for a great success in my opinion; she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore, she has picked up small hobbies in her free time. She goes to school, which shes late for all the time, comes home takes a shower and takes a nap. She stays in her room all the time, whereas I am always socializing with my parents. \nThis started from a young age. When I entered middle school, I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick; when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup, she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup. She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us. These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this. \n\nI love my younger sister to death, and I dont blame her. Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has, or she’ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better. I try not to resent her, its really hard. I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family. \n\nThe most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college (march2023-aug2023 when i left for college). My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice. I went to practice with a busted lip, bleeding nose, and huge bruise on my forehead. My younger sister saw, my mom wasnt home. My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident, but i could hold her off. Obviously it was different than when my dad did it. Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger. \n\nI just moved home from college yesterday, so we decided to go out to eat for dinner. I was cheery and in a great mood, dressed for the occasion appropriately, making conversation the whole way, laughing and trying to be pleasant. My sister, sat with her airpods in, my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right, and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she (didnt want to spend her sunday doing this). She didnt even order food at the restaurant. When we sat down for dinner, my parents and I had a huge argument. I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now. When i left for college, I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter. She babysat for them a handful of times. I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer, and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job. At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1. I clapped back at her, since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money. Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job. My parents got furious that I said that, their only explanation was that it was their decision to “parent how they want to parent”. They were infuriated with me, instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude! \n\nI know that parenting style differs from older sibling to younger sibling, we are two different people so I completely understand that! I just dont feel like its normal for me to feel this way, and I don’t feel like this is traditional or normal. My whole family has tons of built up resentment towards each other, with my grandparents, aunts uncles cousins etc.\n\nNow that you guys know my whole life story!!! 😂\n\nQuestions : \n- I am absolutely terrified to pass this treatment down to my children. How can I prevent this? \n- I want to live a happy, successful life. Should I seek therapy to help deal with all of the emotions and baggage this brings? \n- I do love my parents even though its been really hard. It would be hard, financially, to cut them out. How can I deal with this moving forward? \n- am i incorrect for feeling some resentment towards my sister?\n\n\ni just really need some kind words and motivation because I am crying writing this. I just dont understand how you could treat a real person like this for so long. I am not trying to play the victim. Sometimes i think its me, is it me? I dont understand why everything is targeted towards me. I tried to explain this in a non-bias way so that you guys could form your own opinions about it. Thank you guys for reading and I already appreciate you for taking the time to read all of this. 🩷 \n\ntl;dr Ive been dealing with the drastic differences of my parents parental style between my sister and I for 10 years. \n",

However, my parents are of the belief that their worries and stresses should not be placed on their children- and so I know that my brother was not told about any of the things my parents knew or witnessed and he was not present himself.

He was to offer it back to me for first right of refusal if he was done with it, and it was useable.  Instead, I found out two months ago or so that he had my father sell it for him.  I was outraged because at the time I would have taken it back from him.  My father then told me that he was going to give me half the proceeds from the sale- which was great- but not what I asked for.  My parents tried to defend themselves and my brother for deciding to sell it - because I gave it to him- but if I had known he was not going to give it back to me when he no longer wanted it I wouldn't have done that in the first place.\n\nI was going to address this directly with my brother, and then my partner got very sick again and died.  He was also an addict and he had a relapse that brought out the most chaotic and unmanageable side of this disease imaginable. I did everything I humanly could for him, but ultimately his body couldn't take it anymore and he died on April 6.  My brother and I were not best friends, but have always gotten along when we are together, and I didn't even receive a text from him acknowledging that my partner (who he had at the very least met) had passed.\n\nToday- my parents and I met for lunch and my dad told me that my brother was wanting to use the tent I have for the bed of my truck- the one I bought after I gave him (at no cost at all to him) my old car.  I was literally shocked- what am I missing here?  Even in addiction- if my brother's partner died I would have managed to acknowledge it- definitely before I thought about asking them (not via my parents) to use something he owns. ",

I joined my friend to her graduation because I'm supportive and I was joking around and shiz like normal family would do and dad goes \"you would've been with them if you stayed in school\" or something SUPER close to that. For context about 4 months ago, I dropped out. My previous school screwed me over trying to have me take an extra class so close to graduation because the lady I had didn't know what she was doing. I was already feeling jealous and upset bc of graduation. I been to two schools this year. The one I am talking about is the online school the public school had the graduation. The online school screwed me over. Well, dad suggested in the first place that it might be easier for me to just get my GED instead and that's what I'm going for. I'm already regretting leaving the public school and dad's comment just made me snap a little bit and made me slightly pissed off. I feel so damn lost and could use some advice on how to go about this.",

         "eviemieviemi",
         "My grandpa (70M) started being creepy around me (16F) around the time of my 10th birthday. He'd grab my thigh under the dining table, slap my ass whenever he could and the last few years he's even started to caress my face while talking to me in this weird tone, especially when he's talking about how pretty he finds me.\n\nIt's always made me really uncomfortable but I'd never thought it was wrong. I thought that grandpa being creepy and touchy was just a part of having a grandpa that everyone could relate to.\n\nI've never seen him do something like that to my cousins or sister, its what made me realise that maybe something else was going on.\n\nOne Christmas during dinner, my aunt noticed my grandpa caressing my thigh and told him to leave me alone and that it was weirld. What he said next haunts me till this day, it made me so unbelievably uncomfortable. He said \"I have to do it a lot now, since soon I won't be able to anymore.\" He didn't mean that he was getting old. I know that, since he was only about 65 at the time. All I could think about was that he would only touch me when I was young. And honestly, how weird is that??!\n\nBut getting older I almost wished that it was true. Maybe if he only liked kids, he'd leave me alone. Even now, with my body being more like a womans, he just just doesn't stop, ever. It's even worse now that he caresses my face and talks to me like someone would to a long lost lover (and he only does it when no one else is around too).\n\nI've talked to my friends about this and they insist that he's a creepy predator and that I should tell my parents. The problem is that I live in another country because my mom is from here, and whenever we go visit home, we always have to stay at grandpa's place.\n\nI also don't want to make things awkward between the family, especially since I'm so quiet during family events. It'll feel like I'm just doing a disservice to everyone by outing grandpa as a creep (if he even is that? I don't know if I'm misusing the word, I'm sorry ), especially since he has a lot of money that they usually spend. \n\nShould I tell my parents? and if I should then how? I don't know how to begin at all...\n\nSorry this was so long, I've just held it in for a while. ",

In my culture I am from it is common for parents to help with taking care of grandkids when my first one was born my mom stayed with me and helped for 2 yrs it was covid time so my dad also got work from home so it completely worked out.  My first was very difficult he had bad acid reflex so constant crying for 4 months it was very very hard after that he outgrew it. My mom kept saying me don’t try for another kid he is already hard to handle and I did understand her point she helped a lot and may be she did not want to got though all that again. She was constantly making me throw my sons clothes toys etc… in my heart i wanted another one.  It was covid time so husbands parents never came to help etc they live in diff country and to be honest I dont know if I could have handled them they are too much and no boundary and my husband doesn’t believe in setting it. Meanwhile my sister started to try for a kid and conceived shortly after my son turned 2.  My husband kept telling me to have another kid but in my brain now it was my sisters turn to be pampered and my mom to be attentive to her. This whole time my husband never said that he can call his parents to help with second kid if I ever had. ..  so I was under impression he expects my mom to help at-least few months again if I ever have a kid again.  But i kept pushing the idea away since I wanted to give my sister her time. Now fast fwd a little she her baby and when her baby turned 1.5 yr old she announced she is pregnant again.. my husband took it very bad that you waited for your sister and yet she proceeded with her plans and did not even consider you. Now I am 36 and feel like I wasted my time following my moms advice about one kid done and putting my sister first.  ( now found recently i have one tube blocked and only option dr gave was ivf.

         "wishingwell_182",
         "I need some advice on a situation I’m really struggling with.\nThis year, I wanted to do something special for my parents and treat them to a cruise as a Christmas gift. I told them in advance so they could plan for it, and both seemed genuinely excited. My mom said “yes” right away, and although my dad didn’t say it outright, he said “sounds like a lot of fun” and went along with the idea—which both my mom and I took as a yes.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: I found a great Memorial Day deal through Royal Caribbean—60% off the room if you add a second guest. I booked a balcony suite for them and a separate room for myself (my mom snores, and only my dad can sleep through it). I messaged them immediately to share the good news. My mom was happy, but my dad didn’t respond.\n\nThen this morning, he completely flipped—yelled at my mom, saying he’s “not doing that” and only went along with it to avoid being “bothered.” That hit me hard. We wouldn’t have pestered him had he just been honest from the beginning. We simply thought we were making plans together as a family.\nNow I’m stuck with an extra $600 charge because removing him from the booking voided the original deal. I never would have booked it if I had known he didn’t want to go. I even tried to explain this, thinking he might understand and at least consider helping with the added cost. But he’s refusing to reimburse me, won’t apologize, and told me I “should’ve known he doesn’t want to do stuff like that”—even though everything he said earlier suggested otherwise.\n\nI feel really hurt. I planned this out of love, hoping to create a memorable experience together, not to be left with more expense and a sense of being misled. I don’t know what to do next. Do I let it go and eat the cost for the sake of peace? Or is it fair to expect some accountability here?\n",

She once told me, “I would have chosen death over marrying your dad” 💔. I know she has her traumas, and what she said is valid, but honestly, I never even knew my dad. I don’t know what he looked like or what kind of person he was.\n\nNobody ever told me anything about him. He just disappeared. I was raised by both sides of the family—my mom’s and dad’s—but never by my actual parents. I was always pitied, treated like someone who constantly needed help. People would help me just to make themselves feel better. They felt bad for me, and as a child, I accepted that. I made myself fragile and pitiful without even realizing it. But now, I’m starting to see the pattern.\n\nMy grandparents are still alive, and I could ask them about my dad or maybe even see pictures of him—because I do want to know. But the problem is, I’m scared. I barely contact anyone, and I know that whenever I speak with family, it triggers me. I end up feeling horrible, guilty, and ashamed. So I try to avoid contact or keep it really brief.\n\nI don’t want to bring up my parents’ relationship or ask questions about them, even though I know it would help me understand myself. I feel tired and emotionally drained. Every time I try to form a relationship with someone, I get reminded of all this—and then I just end it without any clear reason. People are always left confused.\n\nI honestly don’t know anything about myself that feels solid or reliable. I feel like I was born out of hate. I just needed to get this off my chest. I want to heal from all of it—but how can I, if I don’t even know both sides of the story?\n\nHow can I ask my family members—not my mom, because she hates them (and I understand, she has valid reasons)—but how can I talk to my grandparents about my dad without my mom finding out? Every time I bring it up to her, she either shuts me down or says something so traumatic that I end up feeling overwhelmingly guilty and ashamed. So I stop asking.\n\nPlease, if you have any advice—I need it. I want to know who I am, and I want to start letting go of this guilt and shame.",

It’s hard to put into words how much that messes with your sense of trust. When the people closest to you, the ones you’re supposed to look up to, keep choosing betrayal… how are you supposed to believe in love?\n\nIt’s hard to fully trust someone when you’ve seen cheating treated like it’s normal. And it hits different when your own father and brother, the men who were supposed to protect and respect the women in their lives didn’t. It leaves this fear in you. I’m scared to fall in love. Scared to give someone all of me and end up getting hurt, lied to, or cheated on. Sometimes I ask myself, how did my mom deal with it all? How did she stay so strong when my dad was still alive? Why did she hide it from us?\n\nMaybe she thought it was for our own good. Maybe she didn’t want us to hate him. But now that I know, it just hurts. It makes me question everything. I’ll never understand cheaters. I’ll never understand how someone could say “I love you” and still do the one thing that could break you. Because if you truly love someone, how could you hurt them like that?\n\nDespite all of this, I’m in a relationship right now. It’s still new, but I feel happy, genuinely happy.

I want to believe that not everyone is like the men I grew up around.\n\nI guess I’m just trying to unlearn everything that was wrongly taught to me. I don’t want to carry this cycle forward.

         "2cats1dog1kid",
         "When I was 36 weeks pregnant, my father in law had a bad fall followed by a hospital stay followed by a parkinsonian disease diagnosis. Hypotension, including orthostatic Hypotension, is a current concern of his condition. For those not familiar, hypotension is low blood pressure. With his condition, this can happen at any time - not just when bending, sitting to standing, laying to standing, etc. \n\nThere have been two instances where I had to call 911 because he went non-responsive due to his low blood pressure. I've been traumatized because at once point I had my screaming 3 month old in one hand, and in the other I was trying to stop my father in law from falling out of his chair while screaming for my husband and burning lunch on the stove. \n\nHis disease (called multiple systems atrophy MSA) is doing generally well as long as he is taking very good care of his health, nutrition and hydration - which he doesn't do well but others take good care of him. He doesn't live with us but hasn't reported episodes of passing out for probably 6 months. \n\nMy husband and I have requested that he not bend down to pick up our 10 month old from the floor, and to ask us and we will hand her to him. Bending over is a risk for blood pressure changes. He ignores our request and picks our daughter up all the time. He says \"im being careful\" but he doesn't understand that \"being careful\" would include asking us to pick her up. The blood pressure changes happen very quickly and he wouldn't feel them coming on. The fear is that he drops baby or falls with her in his arms. \n\nMy husband apparently yelled at his father tonight while I was at work. When he told me the story (I'm fully on board with our request for his father), I mentioned that we are REQUESTING this from his father and that a request isn't the same thing as a boundary. My husband thinks we are setting a clear boundary but there isn't a consequence involved so im not sure we really are.\n\nHad anyone dealt with aging grandparents and needing to set boundaries around their interactions with the babies? Anything similar? I could use advice and/or solidarity.",

My mom has some sort of mental illness as well I think schizophrenia but she’s in denial and doesn’t want To get help. She uses money from the government and she does YouTube tarot and blows up that money on clothes and expensive stuff for her room.\n\nMy grandpa is 84 and is the main person that pays the rent and bills. He plans to retire this year. \n\nI know it’s a lot but any advice what I should do?",

         "I've been physically, mentally, and sex.ually\n\nabused from my family I live in a foreigner country and didn't meet/talk to my relatives since forever and from what I heard they're not good people and super strict so I can't ask them for help+ my sister tried to ask the for help but they just blocked her.\n\nI have 0 relationship with my brothers one of them grew up abroad and we never even say hi. The only times I talked to him were in fights and him treating to kill me.\n\nMy other brother tried to sleep with me and I didn't talk to him since then (it's been 2 years) Qnd even tho I told my mom she didn't do anything. I even asked her to at least not let him into my room (me and my mom share a room) because it made feel so unsafe but she fought with me and told me that she won't get out of the room to talk to him because of me.\n\nThey're super religious and I don't even get to choose my clothes they literally the ones who choose it and I'm not allowed to wear anything other than what they want me to.\n\nMy family ran away from them years ago she was my only friend and my entire family and everything her leaving made it 10x harder.\n\nI don't get financial help from them and have been working since I was 15. I just quit my last job 2 weeks ago because I'm so sick of this life. I want to find myself and feel loved.\n\nI've been thinking about leaving them but I've seen my sister's experience and how hard life is specially that I worked myself and tried it she just\n\nwent from a misery to another kind of misery. I don't wanna make the same mistake as her even she herself tells me to not do it the same way she did.\n\nI tried to find someone to help me so I searched for women shelter talked to them and had an interview with them and after doing so I realized that even tho I'm gonna have more freedom but feeling safe, loved, accepted, and having a warm home are not part of the deal.\n\nI've been getting therapy for almost 3 years now\n\nso I'm aware of myself and the thing that I found effecting me the most and the worst between everything was not having a family. Even tho I physically do but tell me why I feel so jealous and empty and find my tears running without my consent when I see a normal family I swear not even a family who's hugging or anything no not at all just them talking together and setting around each other breaks my heart I always wonder was that too much to ask?\n\nWhen my friends talk to me and say \"oh my brother told me\" and continues all I think about is what? U talk with your brother? How lucky. A little note I don't remember my dad he died when I was about 3.\n\nWriting all this together made me realize how missed up my life is and makes me laugh. After u understood the situation here's what I need.\n\nI thought about it way too much and I've come to the solution of getting a new family. I really want a family so bad a place where I can feel safe, cared for, and part of something real. I'm not looking for financial help or anything materialistic. Just a kind family or older individuals who might be open to having someone like me in their life, even as a hosen family or just a safe space to feel at home. I'm open to helping around the house, learning new skills and even learning a new language for them.\n\nIf you know any communities or places (even\n\nco_living situations or similar not crazy prices though bc I did search and the prices were crazy) where people welcome someone like me. I'd be so grateful for your suggestions.\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

         "I’m just gonna go for it. I’m so fucking tired of this family sometimes I just want them all dead, istg some days I imagine dealing with the grief would be easier than dealing with THEM.\n\nSome context.\nI have two older sisters, we’ll call the eldest sister rosey and the second eldest Elia. I also have an older brother who’s the oldest out of all of us, we’ll call him nick.\n\nWhen I was a kid my sister, Elia, passed away in a crash. This fucked up most of us, who would react happily to a seven year olds death?\n\nFor years on end I grew up with these psychos, my older sister, rosey, who I love to pieces and I am genuinely close with her now, wasn’t that nice but I get why. She would constantly be drinking and getting in trouble with the family and police. One time she’d come home drunk and my mum was on holiday, so my aunties dealt with her. They quite literally were beating her up, keep in mind she was like 16, I had gotten it on record and the police obviously confiscated my device. I was like 7-8. Over the years from 4-12 I witnessed so many fights, so obviously it fucked me up. These fights would be between my older sister, rosey and my brother as well as between them and my mum. Like physical fights as well as screaming. \n\nMy brother is a whole other issue. Istg he’s a psycho. He’s a big guy. He’s also been gaming for years so it gets him angry. He would spray paint the outside of the house with words like “slut” and “bitch” and “whore” towards my mum. \n\nI don’t know whether to bring this up but I will, when I was like 8, my brother was around 20 and he came in my room one night at around 4:30 am talking about God and then asked if I wanted big boobs to show the boys, obviously I said yes and he said “stay up till 5 and I’ll show you how to make them bigger” I don’t know if he was trying to scare me as a joke or was gonna do something but I was so scared so I went to sleep.\n\nI never told my family about that.\n\nMultiple times he showed up to my house, where he didn’t live anymore with a knife, threatening to kill himself. (He’s bipolar I think?)\n\nOver the years he eventually went to prison for drugs and stayed away for around 3-4 years till I was like 15. \n\nHe’s a manipulator and a blackmailing cunt as well! He seemed fine, even had a daughter with another psycho. He’s been fine pretty much up until now, but a last week his daughter peed on his bed and he was screaming on call with my mum, saying if she didn’t come pick his daughter up he would lock her in the bathroom but my mum was busy with me and my bestfriend and she’s has enough of him.\n\nAnd now he’s threatening rosey for £30 saying she’ll find out tomorrow if he doesn’t get the money (which she put in the shed for him to get as she’s pregnant and already has a kid so logically she wouldn’t want him around)\n\nHe also used to punch me when I was a kid and always got away with it! 😁 \n\nObviously my mum isn’t much of a victim here, I do love her to bits but she used to neglect us and never had a good relationship with rosey. After Elia passed i guess she tried to be better but didn’t improve much. \n\nAnyway me and rosey are both terrified of nick, saying he’s a toddler in a grown man’s body with anger issues and is aggressive. \n\nI’m terrified of him and always have been. \n\nHonestly the whole family, both mum and dad’s side are freaks, psychos and crazy. My auntie abused and neglected her kids, then had another after losing the others to CPS, my uncle threatened to kill himself to make his wife stay and before that tried to kill himself for attention (he admitted to that).\n\nMy Nan on mums side abandoned her and then came back, my auntie on mums side has drama with rosey and neglects her kids, her youngest who’s like 9 has fake belly button piercings, laughs and smiles behind doors when baby’s get hurt, and wears super revealing clothing. \n\nIstg the only none fucked up person is my other auntie on dads side\n\nI’m sorry if this is messy but I hope you guys can give me advice. I’m 16, turning 17 in a few months. I don’t want to be like them, I want to be a better person. Istg it’s like a family curse.\n\n(And my brother says I’m not traumatised yet my sister rosey and mum were physically fighting while drunk last year and I fell to the floor sobbing and literally having flashbacks. Like I am not okay.)\n\nHave a good day yall! 😝",

         "This has been a recurring thought to me. My mom and I have had this conversation *multiple* times, but she'd always say it's against the Bible to divorce with your spouse. I respect that, but I just know she's as frustrated as I am. Maybe more.\n\nI don't know if I can even convince her. But I'm just tired of seeing her cry after every time dad yells at her. And, mind you, they argue about anything—where spoons should be, how shirts should be folded, etc. No matter how minor it is, dad would make a big deal about it and blow it out of proportion.\n\nDad has always been a manipulative, self-centered, self-righteous, gaslighting, narcissistic person who shows a different version of himself to the public but shows his true nature to me and my mom. Personally, it's pitiful that he prioritizes his image to the public rather than how he's supposed to be as a husband and father at home.\n\nHe'd always want to prove how wrong me or my mom are no matter how many people (yes, people) tell him otherwise. It just goes to show that he'd go through lengths just to prove you wrong. At this point, he probably waits for me or my mom to make a mistake to throw it back to our faces.\n\nI wanna emphasize how bad it is by sharing to you all what my mom said to me recently: \"I wish your father would just physically abuse me instead of verbally.\" Why? So she'd be able to justify her reason to leave him.\n\nHonestly, this post doesn't even cover a *quarter* of what dad is as a person. But I'm painting y'all a picture just so I can see if I can find a way to make my mom's life (and mine included) peaceful, for once. I'm open to hear any advice or anything. Thanks (F 19).",

I personally believe that this feeling of outsider started when I was 8. That was when my Lil bro was born. When he was born, he instantly just took away all the attention from people who once loved me so much and were so affectionate towards me, including my dad. My mom was always affectionate.\n\nI can still remember a time where I could dance, sing, play, talk and go out with my day and felt no uncomfortable about it. But now everytime, not only when my dad's around, even when my mom's around, I just make this kinda mental barrier to not expose or talk or \"be myself\" much. Like for example i can't even talk freely to my mom about the business I am currently working on. \n\nMy behaviour as a 18year old male changes when they are around. And the I feel like if they never treated me like center of attention when I was a kid, and gave so much love and affection and just treated me normally, i might have been.... Normal. Now it just feels like all those love is long gone. I still sometimes find my dad enjoy my childhood videos but it just feels like i can't get back to it. But this problem is also becoming a big reason why I can't make much friends even tho I want to.

Has 2 kids- aged 2 and 1. Is going through a divorce. She was over this morning at my mom’s house with the rest of my family, who all were cleaning getting ready for a party tmrw. My 2 nephews were getting into something they weren’t supposed to, and while the rest of us are trying to parent them and get them to stop, my sister (their mom) was sitting on the couch on her phone Which is a reoccurring thing that happens a lot. So my mom got aggravated and said “get off your phone and get your kids” My sister blew up. Started bawling her eyes out and screaming at my mom saying “SHUT UP STOP TALKING TO ME LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF MY KIDS. LETS GO BOYS NOBODY WANTS US HERE. GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US NONE OF YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT US” then proceeded to take her kids outside and to the car. my mom stopped her and asked if she could say goodbye to my nephew and my sister told her no and to f*** off. then threatened to not let any of us ever see her kids again, who feel like my little brothers, they’ve been at our house at least 3 times a week since they were born. i babysit them all the time. she then says “if i get in a car accident on my way home you wouldn’t even care.” then my mom threatened to call the police, scared for her and my nephews safety. anyway it died down and she went home. \n\nso fast forward to tonight, i check life360 and she has her location paused. never done this before so it’s out of pettiness i assume. mom then sends “goodnight girls i love you all” to our family group chat. my sister doesn’t respond and then leaves the group chat. \n\ni guess this is kind of a venting post but also an advice post. how do i help her? she hates her life right now, isn’t taking her medication, going through a divorce, and i just don’t know how to help. we’ve all done nothing but try to support her. it’s not fair to us for her to keep her children away from us. but i know she can as she’s their mom. i just don’t know what to do. help ",

         "Ok-Assumption-5445",
         "For context, my sister and I are teenage twins, and our family has a history of mental illness. Both my parents had traumatic childhoods, with my mom’s anxiety disorder passing on to me and my dad’s chronic depression as well. My extended family consists of alcoholics, narcissists, and abusers (Hence why I don’t have much contact with most of them). My parents, despite their struggles, have been amazing and incredibly supportive of us. I have always struggled with mental illness, got a line of disorders under my belt, but have always have supported by them. I’m transgender (ftm), somewhat alternative, and very open. My sister on the other hand is “basic” (nothing wrong W that) conservative, hates physical touch (from family only?) and has a completely different sense of humour. She’s also extremely selfish, unemphatic, and at times cruel. She’s always been very bitter toward me, constantly criticizing how I am and what I do. She’s admitted she’s embarrassed by me. She doesn’t share, then becomes enraged when I don’t either. She leaves dirty dishes in shared spaces, and doesn’t care. She has a very hard time seeing other peoples perspective, and has a very “just-world” attitude. The worst part is, she’s incredibly disrespectful to my parents. My parents spoil us in the sense that they don’t ask much from us, but anything they do ask of me I do. She doesn’t. “Can you do the dishes please?” She will wait days and days until my parents are fed up and exhausted. She’s condescending, never seeing the big deal and thinking they’re being dramatic. When she gets home, she immediately goes up stairs and gets annoyed when people bother her. She hates favours. It’s always transactional. I have to bribe her with money to have her help me. I genuinely think she might be a narcissist, but she has absolutely no idea. She thinks anything that happens to her is not her fault. Anyway, my dad has his struggles too, but I love him. He’s almost exactly like me, and we have a very strong bond. He’s a joker, like me, so we’re always goofing off. But, he’s gone through a lot of trauma and honestly? His depression seems to have gotten worse over the years. It’s very easy to tick him off, and he catastrophes over the smallest things. He has a terrible time letting things go. But he’s still very sweet, and always apologizes after. But my sister hates him. Out of all of us, she’s especially cruel to him. When we were younger, she wouldn’t hug him, and would basically avoid him. I don’t know why. Even now, she dislikes him. We had a talk in her car once and she confessed that she HATES him, and doesn’t like me either. And it’s just a natural tendency of hers. She doesn’t know why, but she just can’t stand the two of us. She doesn’t find us funny, she doesn’t get us. And she knows he doesn’t like her. She knows he loves me more. He’s always been there to comfort me when I feel hurt by her because he can relate, so I’ve never felt alone in the situation. But it’s gotten so normalized that when she says something terrible, we’d just glance at eachother, maybe smile a bit. Now, considering my dad’s kinda lethargic, he just complains about her when she’s not around. Calling her names, just absolutely done with her shit. And part of me appreciates this, because my mom won’t acknowledge her shitty behavior toward me and I need someone too. But another part of me feels that it’s wrong, and that I have an obligation toward my sister. I don’t know. I hate her. She is so unbelievably cruel to me, I don’t even consider her my sister. When I was 13, I had to force myself to lose all feelings of love toward her because her constant rejection and bitterness was destroying my mental health. I just feel uncomfortable by the fact that they both hate eachother so openly, and I’m stuck dealing with my dad’s disappointment and my sisters rage. Advice would be appreciated.",

         "I 24 F am currently dealing with my verbally abusive grandfather, for some background to why I'm in this situation.\n\nMe and My Fiance 26m Lost our home in January and we were homeless for a month til my grandparents took us in we thought it was a nice gesture at first but it has become crystal clear that they never wanted to actually take us in, because ever since we have been here it has been nothing but condescending comments, fights, drama and they have expressed multiple times that they want us to hurry and get on our feet and leave, When we try to point out their toxic behavior my grandfather says \"well if you don't like it, you can leave\" knowing full well we have no where to go.\n\nLately the aggression and mean comments have been getting worse I've been doing my best to pull my weight by cleaning up after my animals, cleaning up the area I'm currently habiting, try to just be out of the way but he still finds issues and reasons to yell at me (he only yells at me when my fiance is at work) \n\nDue to a current health condition I can't work and I'm trying to get an official diagnosis, and this seems to be an issue for him because having a chronic illness seems to be a foreign concept,it doesn't help that I have 3 cousins also living here who don't work, they don't do chores, they are constantly bringing people here, even when my grandparents tell them not to, and he never says anything to them because it's their house. \n\nBut doesn't that mean that they should be doing chores since they live here? Like what \n\nOk sorry that was a long background so the reason I'm writing this is because I recently sprained my foot so I've been having trouble doing things like getting up to eat or use the restroom without being in extreme pain. (Think fire ants constantly attacking your foot)\n\nMy grandfather came home is a bad mood and started taking it out on my nana at first then when I was sitting on the toilet he decided to yell at me through the bathroom door on how \"I need to pull my weight\" and  \"get off my lazy ass\" and \"if you don't do what I want you to I'll put your cats in a shelter\" and apparently me responding to him is talking back I'm sick of walking on egg shells constantly I'm doing my best giving my chronic Illness and now my foot injury it just feels like anything I do isn't good enough and this isn't the first time he's yelled at me like this he's even threatened to take me in the front yard and beat me up. \n\nAnd me and my fiance haven't saved up enough to get out of here and I can't take this anymore my mental health is tanking to the point where I'm having some not so nice thoughts again.. I feel like I'm back in middle school is anyone else dealing with something similar? What should I do? \n\nFor context I have 4 animals in total 3 cats and 1 dog.",

         "So I’ve (f) got two sisters and 1 brother. All of us are over 60, my Fathers Celebration of Life is coming up, we basically have all the same people in mind to invite. My Dad wasn’t very social, so a few few nearby neighbors who were kind to him, our close relatives and a few friends left from when he was married to my mom, she passed away a couple of years ago. \n My sister in law took it upon herself to invite a brother of hers and wife, another of her sisters and her husband. The brother/wife are both overly religious and T supporters, my Dad had such a distaste for them, because of this. Saw them maybe 2 times in the last 5 years. My sister in law and my brother would also complain about them. The other sister/ husband we hardly ever saw, the last few years. Me and my sister were appalled at the invite, to where I was speechless. My sister was bold enough to speak up, saying that she didn’t think it was appropriate, and sister in law saying “what do you want me to do? Uninvite them? ….. silence.\nShe ended it with “No I’m not going to do that”. BTW another of my sister in laws sister and husband were invited. They’ve been a part of the extended family more so. Dad liked them.\nI’m torn. Also, we’re POC they’re not. If that makes a difference.\n\n",

         "My whole family thinks I’m the trouble child because of my mum",
         "Random29225",
         "Hi I 21F have been bullied and treated poorly my whole life by my family.\n\nI am the eldest child of 2, me 21F and sister 19F. As a child I used to want to be friends with 19F and in all the pictures you could see it, I would cuddle her and try and play with her hair and I would try and just love her, eventually over time we started becoming disconnected, she always wanted to be with our mum and it used to be that our dad was a very tough and strong man, he was strict and taught us everything we know but we used to fear him because of that. My sister when she was at home with dad and I she would be in the other room or on her device, where as I used to want to watch movies with him and wanted to understand him, as time went on I can see now I probably tried to hard, I always wanted to be the best child I could be and I can honestly say that I tried so hard. At home when I was around 11 and my sister was 9 that's when things started changing, my parents would call me a liar all the time and I would rarely lie and my mum would send me to my aunts because in her words \"I can't deal with her\" but my sister would stay at home. When I was supposed to go on excursions for school they would do small things like not letting me have money but letting her have money or sometimes I just wasn't allowed to go.  \n\nAs we got into high school I distanced myself from my family, I got social media and I started making friends but I was never allowed to go to party's so people slowly stopped inviting me. I started to become depressed as I watched my sister go to boy girl party's and sleepovers and my parents would always tell me it's because I never got invited, 1 day when I did get invited I had to take the blame for a friend for a friend when she got in trouble with a teacher and my parents stopped me from going. When I met my now husband things got worse, I was told that he was bad for me and that they didn't like him because he ate too much chocolate and random excuses and soon after that is when I started distancing myself even more I would spend nights at my husbands mums house when we were 17. As the years went on my parents hated that I wasn't there anymore so they offered to let me live on a granny flat on their property but that was the worst thing for me. My dad made a contract that had rules for my living there, I wasn't allowed my husband over at all, I had to be at the house 5 nights a week, I couldn't have any visitors day at the granny flat, I didn't have a washing machine so I had to wait for them to be there to do it and if they went away I couldn't wash my clothes. Failure to do any of these things would end up with me getting kicked out. This is when I realised how controlling they were, my sister meanwhile drove 2-3 hours to meet some guy who she ended up dating, during this time she would never be home, she would not listen to anyone but mum and dad didn't care. The rules for me and the roles for her were completely different. My mum and dad then wanted to open a business and offered it to my sister and he boyfriend, I begged them to give me a chance and instead after about 6 months in the house they kicked me out so that my sister and her new boyfriend could move in, I was sick at the time and I asked them to wait because I couldn't do it, they then changed the locks, through my stuff into rubbish bags and locked it in their garage saying I need to get it off them and that I am disowned because they didn't want me. I got my things and left and moved in with my nana and my husband for about 6 months on and off. \nThen as we were visiting my grandfather my mum called saying my dad passed away, my husband and I drove 3-4 hours at night down to my mum, my mums whole family was there and they controlled everything, they didn't let my husband in with me, they made me leave after a period and I had nothing to do with the funeral, I also found out a bunch of dads old friends didn't even get invited to the funeral because mum didn't want to. I agreed to try and help mum during this time by cleaning and doing what I can and no sooner then I arrived I got kicked out because 1 day my sister had a panic attack because I moved her washing basket into her room while I was cleaning the bathroom. She ended up scratching up my arm, screaming at me, spitting at me, and she pushed me and then as she was about get in my face I pushed her down onto her bed and told her to stop and calm down, she then ran out of the house and cried hysterically in her car somewhere, when I called mum it was immediately my fault and I should never have done the cleaning and I should never have spoken to her even though I was asked to clean and try and fix things with her. \nMum kicked me out the next week saying that I was causing too many problems, I then asked her if she had noticed how this is a form of attention seeking manipulation, and she told me to stop lying to make my sister seem bad and things were never like this when I was gone and I need to go. \n\nI left and I haven't spoken to mum since in person and I moved away with my husband, mum still screams at me over text and gets angry at me over text but I don't know what to do.\nI've spoken to some of dads old friends who mum was rude to and they told me they noticed the favouring of my sister over me. \n\nI'm honestly just exhausted. \nPlease offer any advice it would be great",

         "starryslp",
         "I graduated with my master’s degree this weekend and it’s something I’ve worked incredibly hard for. I paid for my family to fly out. My older sister missed her flight despite me begging her to show up to the airport early. No apology, just excuses.\n\nShe eventually made it to the ceremony—but late—and then left halfway through, taking my nephew, brother in law, and sister with her. They very much enabled her in this scenario. I never saw them afterward. No hugs, no celebration, no pictures. I watched my classmates take photos with their families while I was alone on one of the most important days of my life.\n\nSince then, she’s minimized everything. She blamed her toothache for leaving the ceremony, said we could take pictures “later” (in the dark, rain, after she left me crying), and now she’s texting me about whether I’ll get her portion of the flight refunded so I can give her the money.\n\nI’ve been blaming myself which I know is so distorted. I kept thinking maybe if I was enough and worth showing up for, she would’ve done so. But I think I’m done. I’m tired of feeling invisible. I’m tired of grieving a sibling relationship that never existed the way I hoped it would. I have the opportunity to move and never speak to my family again. But going no contact terrifies me. I love my nieces and nephews and I feel like I’d be abandoning them.\n\nI know this isn’t sustainable. I just don’t know how to stop blaming myself, or how to start healing without carrying the guilt. Has anyone here successfully gone no contact with a narcissistic sibling, and found peace on the other side?",

She took some amount of money from her sister and said later you can take this plot (A) or half of another plot say (B). Plot B is a bit bigger in size than A. Then my father had paralysis and my aunt helped financially in treatment and all. She helped me take admission which costed around 75k. Now my mom is retired and planning to make a house in plot B. My aunt is torturing my mom, fighting with her saying she needs hapf of plot B. We said take plot A. But she's so adamant that she wants plot A. One of my cousins told me that this aunt fought with her, one of my uncles for land. That cousins family took 1.2 lac rupees loan from her and she took their 60 lac plot. My parents are aged and has not been keeping well since the past few days. And she keeps calling and shouting on phone. I told my sister to go to court with mom and transfer the land on her name. We have nothing in the name of property and that aunt's husband has accumulated enough wealth through black money which two people working together will never be able to earn in years. We are not denying that we won't give the plot. We are just saying take plot A instead of B. Any suggestions how to deal?",

         "I’m not sure if this is the right place to say this but I was just wondering if anyone would have any advice or be able to tell what’s going on.\n\nI have felt uncomfortable around my dad for a very long time like since I can remember , I don’t like going in the same room as him or sitting next to him and I constantly try to get away from him or face in the opposite direction and not make eye contact. This is because I have a gut feeling that he has previously sa’d me or that he’s going to and I can feel it physically to, it’s just a deeply uncomfortable feeling I get when I’m around him and I just feel disgusted being anywhere near him. I refuse to talk to him or let him pick me up from work etc because I am scared of him.\n\nToday it got even worse and I had a panic attack and couldn’t breathe properly, I stayed in my room the rest of the day not eating drinking or moving,basically just hiding from him just because I had to go in his car as my mum is in hospital so she couldn’t pick me up.,this has happened before. When I got home I overheard my dad and mum talking and he was saying that “It p1sses me off that she says that because I’m actually hard to get” and then he said that he’s more “popular” than me because his face doesn’t look like mine..\nThis has just kind of stuck with me and I find it a very weird reaction .\n\nMy brother had drug induced physcosis not long ago and he said he remembered my dad dr#gzing and r.ping him and me when we were younger . Although he was in physcosis I don’t believe those memories just came out of nowhere but I’m not sure, and to be honest when he told me I wasn’t shocked and I did believe him. But then my mum and dad obviously denied this and he went to hospital.\n\nI just need some advice on what to do as I don’t feel safe here anymore.",

         "Training-Mastodon-48",
         "\nHi all, \n\nI am looking for advice. Sorry for the length, poor formatting and everything else. \n\nTLDR - My golden child loving parents yet again chose everyone except . \n\nI really do not know where to begin. My family have a golden child f28 GC and myself f31. We live on a very expensive island. Since turning 18 my parents made my pay £400 a month in rent while I lived with them which is fair enough. And anything i borrowed i would have to payback with interest. Since prior to turning 20 i have not borrowed anything. Maybe not so fair. GC on the other hand they pay her rent each month since 18, her horses livery and Living expenses. Last year the VERY conservative figure was over 500k excluding education fees, she went to uni i didnt ect.\n\nWe have only since I turned 30 been back in contact. After a 4 year silence just to there actions / in actions and selfishness. \nA recent example of this is we have a freedom celebration on  the island and this year marked a hugely significant number. They have a parade with old cars, my parents have recently purchased one which is a 3 seater and ment this would be the first year in the parade. It was going to be my grandmother and parents in the parade. The week before my mother told my partner that my nan was not going to be in the 3rd seat and my sister was returning for a week for the celebrations. I was not told and it was all made to be like it was last minute. Yes they paid for her return. We went and watched the parade. She was in the back in costume which given her height would have to be a custom order. It was all planned. \n\nI will mention  when we started talking again I was given the few years of birth and Christmas presents missed as a gift which was very nice and 2.5k. I am mentioning this clairty as unfortunately despite being a jan birthday. They only remember every 3 years.  \n\nMy mother informs me that GC and I are both treated equally and if she spends something on a gift or lends more to me. She sends GC the same amount. \n\n\n My Partner m46 and myself were looking to purchase, my grandparents family home that my grandfather built. It is currently indeed of alot of work and has been vacant for over a year. We offered them a substantial amount for us. The house is worth about 650k in its current state. Their delusional asses think that they can get 900k and we offered our max of 650k thinkng we are family and they would be happy for it to stay in the family. They turned us down because they full amount. We said okay what about the 650k and we pay an extra amount each month to make up the difference. I think this is fair. We get laughed at. \n\nThis house is where I spent the vast majority of my childhood. Both parents would work full time. I have happy memories because it was by the sea and we would go the beach for adventures and explore everywhere. \n\nAt the end of last year GC returned to the island and the next day the next day the house was pulled from the market. My parents didn't tell us until 3 days ago. We found out the day it was pulled from other sources but acted like we didn't know to see how long they would keep it up. The answer 6 months. Okay we didn't need to know but we asked them if they had viewings and offers and they lied to us. \n\nThey issue i have with this is i love this property. I really want to be able to purchase it. \n\nThey only see money and when my grandmother dies, which given her deteriorating health will not be long. They are going to gift the property gc or sell it and gifts her a significant amount of money from the sale. There are so many things that they have given her that I will never get the same.\n\nI am at the point I want to burn the bridge and walk away. They make no effort to talk to me and only talk to my partner even on thing he doesn't understand such as my parents and I work in finance, my partner doesn't so they talk to him about finance stuff and ignore me. \n\nMy Partner who had a bad childhood and is now all his family are gone says I am going to regret burning the bridge. \n\nWhat would you do in this situation?\n\n\n",

         "(My first post btw) I (16f) is part of a family of 5. My dad, my mom, my little brother (12yo) and my big sister 18(yo). I am the middle child. When I grow up I thought my family was just like any other families. I thought that fighting everyday countless times a day was normal. I always had some social problems and when I grew up I start have a lot of anxiety attacks and was diagnosed with intense social anxiety to the point I couldn't go out of my room or else I would have an anxiety attack, eye contact was the scariest thing, I could NOT do it. I stayed at my room going out only at night where everybody was asleep to get some food. My parents did not understand me a bit. My parents aren't necessarily bad people which makes it even worse...  they do want the best for me but.. my father always talks about \"discipline!\" He always says \"it's all about discipline!\" He thought that I wasn't going to school and just staying in my room because I'm lazy. He has ocd and anger issues DOES TWO DO NOT WORK TOGETHER WELL if you dare to accidentally spill a drop of water He will go into a fit of rage! Even if you try to calm him down and tell him that you will clean that yourself he will just scream at you and tell you that he will deal with it and that you should just go to your room. I don't blame my dad. My dad grew up as one of 3 brothers and his mom (my grandma) had died when he was 7 years old leaving only his brothers and his father (my granpa) who wasn't around much. He also had social difficulties when he was a child and never had many friends. He refused to get help such as therapy for hus trauma, ocd and anger issues. My mother is a kind person who always trues to keep the family together but she has a problem with overreacting. Both my parents are like a ticking boom and you never know when they'll start to burst. Ironically that made me the child always the one who tries to calm my parents down. My big sis had hit me a lot when I was younger and I grew up scared of her as now we don't talk to each other At ALL, actually she quit distant from all of us and never around. my little brother and I are similar and I'm afraid he's going in the same direction as me as lately he starts to stay in his room a lot, my parents are dilling with him the same way they dealt with me... NOT GOOD! \nThere's alot more to vent about my family but I'm afraid this post might be too long. All I wrote isn't even close to all what's broken in my family...",

         "So my mom is a SAHM. I used to live an hour away from my family, but recently moved back close to family for work. I was told when i moved back, i would have the support, and help needed for my daughter. I am a single mother, the father is still in my daughters life and is a great dad. I get her one week, he gets her the next. We both work day shift so we usually need someone to watch her during the summer while we work (or if its during the school year and she cant make it to school). My mom waited until about a month or so after moving to let me know that she now requires payment any single time i need a babysitter (even if its just for a few hours, time doesnt matter to her), and the same goes for my daughters dad. We both have to pay her. Where i am on a very tight budget, i literally cannot hardly afford to anything extra, let alone 50/60 bucks a week. She has told me she is sticking to it and will not watch her unless she is paid. She said she feels entitled to compensation because she is providing a service to us, which i do understand, but yanno i kinda thought she would understand that i can't afford it. Well now, my daughters father had to have a babysitter (because my mom offered to watch her today and yesterday) and he has apparently not given her any money and now my mother is asking me where the money is and who is responsible for her payment. Her and the father do not get along well (my mother is an actual narcissist), so im just waiting for this to all blow up..ive always seen other families including the fathers family never charge for watching their own grandchilden, i didnt think that was going to be a thing with her. Also for context i provide everything my daughter needs including food when she is over at my mothers house, so thats not an issue. Is my mom being ridiculous? Or is it just me?",

I don't like to press their buttons or make them feel left out, left out of society. They have trouble socializing and don't understand simple concepts, so they do whatever they can to take those concepts away from me. I don't know how to ignore them, my heart just crushes. It's a very bad dynamic because I pretty much do everything they say, even when it hurts myself. I'm an empath and am extremely selfless...I've signed up for therapy for highly sensitive people but that doesn't start til May 27th. Any advice on how to cope with a broken family? I don't want to make them feel insecure or less than. They already feel that way. I can't keep throwing myself in the trash for them...it's hurting me and destroying my life one day at a time. My life is destroyed. My fashion is destroyed, my dancing is destroyed, they are destroying everything I love and am good at. I've always learned things very quickly...I'm just born like that. They don't understand the simple concept on how to live. Life is so fun and so simple, yet they crack it open with all this depressing stuff. I really need help. How do I deal with this malfunctioned family. There's gotta be a solution. I can't be the only one outshining them and making them look bad. And the fun niest part is, they feel so powerful doing this. How do they not realize they don't know how to do anything good...Even worse they try to make me bow down to them and stuff. It's REALLY bad...I'm not sure how to deal with this. Clearly I dont want to but I would just...I dont know I dont know where to go. I'm 27 and live with them because I'm on medication and it makes it hard for me to leave/work. They have full control over me. I just need advice. SOMEBODY'S gotta help me. ",

         "Using a throwaway account because I don't want this linked to my main.\n\nI am 22f from India. I live with my brother (27M), mother (49F) and father (54M). Living with your parents tilk you get married is kind of the norm here. My family has always had a lot of issues. It's always felt like everything's held together by a thread that could snap at any moment.\n\nLast month when my Grandpa died (mom's dad), my parents had a huge fight (mostly dad screwed up), and then I shifted to Grandma's place to keep her company for a bit so she doesn't spiral out by herself. \n\nI stayed at her place for almost 2 months before she left to stay with my uncle's family for a bit. While at her place, I had a lot of peace and quiet and no family drama or tension or tip toeing around everyone's feelings. I didn't have to worry that one wrong word would make my dad or my brother blow up. I didn't have to keep checking whether whoever I was talking to was actually listening to what I said. I didn't have to sit and listen to a constant barrage of useless unsolicited advice when I just want to vent. \n\nI shifted back home after Grandma left. They've always fought and stuff but, I now wake up every morning to raised voices and yelling in the kitchen between my dad, my mom and my brother. I have to deal with my parents constantly cribbing to me about what the other did or said or didn't do or didn't say. I have to worry that one word will lead to my dad or my brother blowing up. I've lost my peace. I had peace for the first time and then I lost it. I tried talking to my brother about it but he tries to play it down saying it's not as bad as I think it is.\n\nI've tried telling my parents that I'm not their therapist or their marriage counselor and to stop treating me as such. But they don't seem to get it. They keep venting and cribbing and expect me to pick sides. To them, this is all a normal part of being a family. They don't seem to understand that they are one team, not two and that they certainly shouldn't be taking jabs at each other and trying to score one over the other. \n\nAll of them love me and treat me like the baby of the family but honestly, it feels suffocating to keep living with them. I want to leave and move out or something but circumstances make it so that I can't leave for a while atleast. I also considered therapy, but we don't have the money for it and they wouldn't go for it nor would they let me go for therapy because they 'don't believe in stuff like that'. They think therapy is for weaklings. I want to be able to protect my peace until I reach a point where I can shift out, but I don't know how. I would appreciate any advice/insights anyone has to offer.",

         "I (F18) was raised by my aunt who I refer to as my mother. After my parents got divorced my dad married a woman who I loathe with every fibre of my being. She has two daughters from a previous marriage Anna (19) and Kate (17). My father currently has 4 children with my stepmom. They’ve all hurt my brother and I in different ways. I love my father and I don’t think he’s ever had bad intentions towards us. However, I do believe that he prioritised them and never considered my feelings. He always has something negative to say about me. Whenever we see each other I don’t feel like I can be myself in front of him. He doesn’t agree with how I dress and it bothers me because he says it’s because he’s “looking out for me” but I don’t think that’s the case. I think he just doesn’t want his reputation to be affected. If he was looking out for me he would’ve been there when my Anna attempted to rape me. When she harassed me whenever I’d go over to their place. Whenever I’d face problems with my stepmom he should’ve defended me instead of siding with the a grown ass woman rather than his own 6 year old daughter. I’m tired of all of this. He’s attempting to fix (some) things now. I want things to get better but I cannot get over all that I’ve gone through. And I know I’ll always end up being hurt at the end of the day. I always leave our interactions with tears in my eyes. I wish we could have a normal relationship but there’s an invisible wall between us.",
