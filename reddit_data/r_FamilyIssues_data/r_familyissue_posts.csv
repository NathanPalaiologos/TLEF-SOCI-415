1kw6yw0,Family and politics,OstrichCorrect9498,"My daughters were very close and are no longer talking due to politics and a text that went on and included others from our immediate family (sisters and brothers in law). A DIL talked to SIL and shared she was going to buy her neice (1st birthday) a girl doll with a boy’s name due to daughter expressing concerns that transgender ideals may be taught in some schools. When my daughter shared the gifts from some family, she thought it was intentional and I didn’t think it was. However recently found out that it was-my other daughter’s husband confirmed it. My daughter doesn’t know this yet. It really bothers me.  Would you tell your daughter that the gift was intentional as she thought?",1,0,1748297189.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kw6yw0/family_and_politics/

While people were getting food I was outside alone with my dad and 4 of his friends. They started talking about duct tape and one guy said “the best part about duct tape is that no no no turns into mhm mhm mhm.” And everyone was laughing obviously except for me. I am a 21 year old girl surrounded by 5 50+ year old men. I saw my dad laughing and I don’t know if he was just laughing to join everyone or what. And I am also worried because if these are the type of guys that my dad hangs out with, then what does that mean about him?

1kw4l5f,Adult children of emotionally immature parents.,Flat-Matter-3314,"Myself and mother are not close. She tries to pretend we are. There’s clearly a lot of history here - she was highly depressive when I was a child and completely unable to see that my behavioural problems were a direct response to her depression and neglect. 

She tries to feign closeness with me, I don’t like it, It makes me uncomfortable and I’ve started to call this out - she recently called because in her words ‘I haven’t spoken to you all week, I’d thought I’d see how you are’ I replied ‘yeah, we don’t talk much’ because we don’t, it’s not uncommon to go weeks without talking. 

When she feels like I need her less and less she tries harder and harder to call me/ feign closeness. We recently discussed potentially going to family therapy together but I’ve decided I don’t want to heal our relationship - I prefer a low contact relationship, how do I explain this? 

A few months ago She also apologised about something that hurt me deeply when I was a child, I thought we may actually begin to build bridges. What she doesn’t know is that I know she told my sister she didn’t mean the apology - I just can’t get over this. (It’s a long story but this is no way is my sisters fault). There is no moving on, I just want her to leave me alone without causing a huge family rift, what do I do?",1,0,1748291169.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kw4l5f/adult_children_of_emotionally_immature_parents/
1kvufk3,Im scared to interact with my dad's side.,Short_Audience7308,"One day my dad was sick, he had a stomach flu and he asked me to grab him some grapes from Freshco which was a few minutes from our house. I couldn't drive at the time I was only 14 so I went to my cousins place (which was in our basement, there immigrants) She and her husband are both my cousins and were married with 2 kids (12 and 7) and I told her if she could take me there. She told me that my uncle was gonna take me (we call our older cousins uncle in terms of respect or wtv and he was around 37) and she had already called him. I got out the house and waited on the driveway for him to pull up and he did like a minute later. I opened the backseat to sit and he said ""No sit in the front with me"" I didn't think anything of it and just sat and i started getting a really weird feeling in my gut like it was a disgustingly bad feeling. We drove there and he parked he turned to me and started touching my thighs and kissing my head and pulling me closer and at the time i was in a state of shock and i didnt know what to do. He stopped for a moment and told me to go get the grapes i went in picked them up and started dreading going back. I felt bad to call my mom or tell someone so i sat back down and he started driving.. he told me to put my hand on his thigh near his crotch and  he started rubbing my thigh and started touching my chest and he did 3 laps around my house and never really got there.  He told me to kiss him and he persisted that i kissed him on the lips which was so disgusting i kinda looked at him and started crying (i was super scared) and he took me back home i wiped my tears and pretended like everything was fine and we both went to my dad who kinda looked at me weirdly and didnt say anything i dont blame him he didnt know. Fast forward a week later i was paranoid like super scared i had locked the doors both back and forth and would go upstairs and lock myself in my room everytime he would come over and I had cried myself to sleep every night. I didnt wanna tell anyone, he was a married man with 2 kids a wife and she was pregnant i felt sick to my stomach everytime i thought about it and one day my dad had pulled me aside and started questioning me he was super worried and after an hour i told him.. i could tell that something in him changed he looked pissed like to the point where i could tell he wasnt okay. a couple days later he came back to me and told me that i had two options we could call the police and report it or he could deal with him by himself kick him out from the basement make him apologize and not let a single soul know and i choose the second one because i didnt wanna ruin his relationship and he had kids what would they think? Its disgusting i know. He apologized and know one knows until now we have an ok relationship i usually never talk unless its a Hi and a Bye but it still haunts me and im scared to even interact with anyone from that side.

He did actually apologize and my dad had beat him up to and he never thought about doing it again.

1kvtoq9,Brother given a house,Own-Needleworker4869,"I just found out yesterday that my brother was given a house in March owned by our dad. I’ve seen him twice since then (brother) and no word of moving or anything. I only found out because my daughter was texting her cousin and she said she was painting her new walls in her room.

I am just beyond shocked and pissed off. We bought our house in 2006 before the crash and at the time was half of my husband’s take home pay and we struggled for YEARS making sure our mortgage was paid and did without. And just to note- this is the same dad that made me come to his house and “plead my case” for $100 of grocery money when my husband lost his job and our son was a baby. He’s never done anything to help our family. Meanwhile, my brother was arrested in 2018, chose not to work for over 5 years and was given a truck and insurance by him.

And a little background info- he is our adopted dad that adopted us from bio dad when I was 10 years old. He also has 2 bio kids of his own. Very negative and verbally abusive to us growing up and my brother claimed to hate him and even threw him into a pantry when he was a teen. I’ve distanced myself over the years due to hard feelings and SA that occurred by his father that was basically brushed off.",1,0,1748264230.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kvtoq9/brother_given_a_house/
1kvt208,Mum is always talking about health issues and asking me for money?,UncutCoconut,"My mum is nearly in her mid 60s, I’m 32M. I moved out 3 years ago and live with my girlfriend in a rented flat about 1 hour away. I visit my mum once a month or sometimes once every 2 months as I’m so busy with work. I run my own business so it takes up a lot of my time and I hardly have time to myself, even to spend with my girlfriend.

My mum lives alone as my dad has moved abroad a few years ago as he’s retired. She doesn’t work as she has health issues and arthritis which prevents her from working a physical job. She still asks me to help contribute money for her rent as she’s on benefits and struggles to pay the bills.

Since I was living there and started working, I used to pay the rent to help out, but since moving out she’s still been asking me to do that. I didn’t mind, but now my finances are so stretched tight with so many expenses to pay and a rise in living costs, that I’m struggling to even pay for myself.

She’s always talking about her health issues which sometimes makes me feel sad. She sends me photos of her brothers who are going through health issues now and asks if I’ll ever take care of her when she’s ill as she lives alone.

My mum had me late and from what I see, normally when parents are of old age, their child is normally in their 40s. I’m only in my early 30s and still exploring life and trying to get my business together. I feel I’ve been given the stress early on as my mum had me late. If it was 10 years later it would be easier for me.

I’m not sure what to do as my full focus is my business right now as I enjoy running it and working, but my mum always messages me with the sad stuff such as health related topics or bills overdue.

1kvpfep,Is there any excuse anymore?,_yvx,"Before I begin, I want to say I don’t hate my parents, but I feel deeply let down by their selfish and neglectful behavior.

My family is far from perfect — they have a lot of psychological issues, and I understand that. They were raised in a harsh environment and experienced abuse as children. I went through my own cycle of unexplainable cruelty too.
My parents divorced in 2020 when I was 14 years old. My father suddenly disappeared from our home for months. It was during the COVID lockdown, and no one could leave the house. My mother told us about the divorce later.
I don’t remember much from that year, but it was filled with pain. Since then, life has been hard. I’ve grown up with mental scars. I’m the eldest of three siblings. My second sister is only one year younger than me, and the youngest is 7 years younger. I was the one who really took care of the youngest and tried to give her attention during that rough time.

Time passed, and in 2022, I changed a lot — and so did my family, but in a worse way. My mother started neglecting us even more, always going out with her friends and saying she “didn’t get to live her life” when she was married to my dad.
She started talking to men on the phone, and I couldn’t stand it. It was painful. As for my dad, every time we go out with him, it’s just orders and negative talk. I’ve been struggling with all of this, but I have to stay strong.
He travels abroad a lot and seems genuinely happy, and so does my mom. And when I talk to someone close about it, they say, “Don’t blame them, they didn’t get to live a healthy life because of early marriage.”

But what about me?

When I ask my dad to take us on a trip, he says “later” and makes empty promises. Then suddenly, he goes off with his friends and travels. My mom does the same.
I feel so much jealousy toward them. They enjoy life, spend money on themselves, and live with full freedom. But when I ask for a trip, my dad says it’s too expensive or makes some excuse. It’s honestly awful.
I just want to go out and live a bit, but the control and selfishness are suffocating. There’s no clear reason for it .

In 2024, they were shocked when I was diagnosed with depression, suicidal ideation, bad habits, anger issues, and self-harm.
And what happened after? My mother said things like, “I didn’t neglect you,” and kept trying to shift blame to avoid guilt.
My father blamed everything on my mom because we don’t live with him. Everything always goes in a bad direction.

I want to go out with my friends. I want to live my life. But they’re so controlling and suspicious about everything. They say no to us, yet go to the same places with their own friends and leave us behind.
I’m honestly thinking of becoming independent as soon as possible. But as the oldest brother, I feel like that would be selfish toward my sisters — they have no power and would be stuck in this toxic cycle.
I’m really fed up with everything.

1kvnhp5,please help me with my family.,PresentLight1069,"hi everyone! Im desperate for answers. I really need help, like so bad. Questions are listed at the bottom. im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory, so this may be kinda long. I am 20 and my younger sister is 17. I am a college student. My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds (mom is white and dad is black). 

My parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten. But, I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old, the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing. My dad was very involved in this sport; I needed to practice everyday, that’s reasonable! As I got older, this sport grew into a monster, I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play. So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches (1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse) so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age. There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3/4 summers straight, and every day after school was dedicated to practicing. I didnt mind this, but my mom is heavily dedicated to school. She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a’s in my all AP (advanced placement) classes. I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week. This was my life from ages 12-18. I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted, he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school, so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center. In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college. 

Once I left for college in 2023, I decided I was going to major in computer engineering. My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them. I ended up doing okay my first semester, but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes, leading to my suspension from the university. I was in over my head in all of my classes. My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college, never asking about my mental health. Only cared about my grades and told me to do some “soul searching”. I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic. Now that its been a year, im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December. 

Since quitting sport (which was my dads thing), and failing school (which was my moms thing) i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me. When I was 16, i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima, which I was EXTREMELY grateful for, took great care of and love it. I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me. I pay for my rent, gas money, and groceries, which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying. Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years.
But….
My sister, who is 17, got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year. She has no pressure to be in any AP classes, she doesnt have a job, she doesnt play sports. She has no pressures in life, which has set her up for a great success in my opinion; she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore, she has picked up small hobbies in her free time. She goes to school, which shes late for all the time, comes home takes a shower and takes a nap. She stays in her room all the time, whereas I am always socializing with my parents. 
This started from a young age. When I entered middle school, I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick; when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup, she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup. She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us. These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this. 

I love my younger sister to death, and I dont blame her. Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has, or she’ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better. I try not to resent her, its really hard. I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family. 

The most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college (march2023-aug2023 when i left for college). My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice. I went to practice with a busted lip, bleeding nose, and huge bruise on my forehead. My younger sister saw, my mom wasnt home. My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident, but i could hold her off. Obviously it was different than when my dad did it. Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger. 

I just moved home from college yesterday, so we decided to go out to eat for dinner. I was cheery and in a great mood, dressed for the occasion appropriately, making conversation the whole way, laughing and trying to be pleasant. My sister, sat with her airpods in, my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right, and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she (didnt want to spend her sunday doing this). She didnt even order food at the restaurant. When we sat down for dinner, my parents and I had a huge argument. I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now. When i left for college, I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter. She babysat for them a handful of times. I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer, and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job. At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1. I clapped back at her, since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money. Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job. My parents got furious that I said that, their only explanation was that it was their decision to “parent how they want to parent”. They were infuriated with me, instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude! 

I know that parenting style differs from older sibling to younger sibling, we are two different people so I completely understand that! I just dont feel like its normal for me to feel this way, and I don’t feel like this is traditional or normal. My whole family has tons of built up resentment towards each other, with my grandparents, aunts uncles cousins etc.

Now that you guys know my whole life story!!! 😂

Questions : 
- I am absolutely terrified to pass this treatment down to my children. How can I prevent this? 
- I want to live a happy, successful life. Should I seek therapy to help deal with all of the emotions and baggage this brings? 
- I do love my parents even though its been really hard. It would be hard, financially, to cut them out. How can I deal with this moving forward? 
- am i incorrect for feeling some resentment towards my sister?


i just really need some kind words and motivation because I am crying writing this. I just dont understand how you could treat a real person like this for so long. I am not trying to play the victim. Sometimes i think its me, is it me? I dont understand why everything is targeted towards me. I tried to explain this in a non-bias way so that you guys could form your own opinions about it. Thank you guys for reading and I already appreciate you for taking the time to read all of this. 🩷 

tl;dr Ive been dealing with the drastic differences of my parents parental style between my sister and I for 10 years.

1kvlmsm,My partner died and the first I hear from my brother is via my parents... he wants to use a tent I own,Spite_CongruentFU," I am an addict in recovery- my addiction took hold while I was an independent adult and while there was plenty of unmanageability and chaos in my own life prior to coming to recovery, I never stole from my family, damaged their property, physically abused them, or harmed them in any way other than emotional stress and trauma as a result of worrying about me- which should not be taken lightly.  However, my parents are of the belief that their worries and stresses should not be placed on their children- and so I know that my brother was not told about any of the things my parents knew or witnessed and he was not present himself.  Rather, my parent's lack of trust in the disease and what I could be like if I started using again seems to be an excuse for my brother to do what he wants and not what is right.

I gave my brother my car when I moved to a different part of Canada, rather than sell it and keep the proceeds for myself, on the condition that he never sell it.  He was to offer it back to me for first right of refusal if he was done with it, and it was useable.  Instead, I found out two months ago or so that he had my father sell it for him.  I was outraged because at the time I would have taken it back from him.  My father then told me that he was going to give me half the proceeds from the sale- which was great- but not what I asked for.  My parents tried to defend themselves and my brother for deciding to sell it - because I gave it to him- but if I had known he was not going to give it back to me when he no longer wanted it I wouldn't have done that in the first place.

I was going to address this directly with my brother, and then my partner got very sick again and died.  He was also an addict and he had a relapse that brought out the most chaotic and unmanageable side of this disease imaginable. I did everything I humanly could for him, but ultimately his body couldn't take it anymore and he died on April 6.  My brother and I were not best friends, but have always gotten along when we are together, and I didn't even receive a text from him acknowledging that my partner (who he had at the very least met) had passed.

Today- my parents and I met for lunch and my dad told me that my brother was wanting to use the tent I have for the bed of my truck- the one I bought after I gave him (at no cost at all to him) my old car.  I was literally shocked- what am I missing here?  Even in addiction- if my brother's partner died I would have managed to acknowledge it- definitely before I thought about asking them (not via my parents) to use something he owns.

I was already feeling jealous and upset bc of graduation. I been to two schools this year. The one I am talking about is the online school the public school had the graduation. The online school screwed me over. Well, dad suggested in the first place that it might be easier for me to just get my GED instead and that's what I'm going for.

1kvcn9e,"Should I out my creepy grandpa? If so, how?",eviemieviemi,"My grandpa (70M) started being creepy around me (16F) around the time of my 10th birthday. He'd grab my thigh under the dining table, slap my ass whenever he could and the last few years he's even started to caress my face while talking to me in this weird tone, especially when he's talking about how pretty he finds me.

It's always made me really uncomfortable but I'd never thought it was wrong. I thought that grandpa being creepy and touchy was just a part of having a grandpa that everyone could relate to.

I've never seen him do something like that to my cousins or sister, its what made me realise that maybe something else was going on.

One Christmas during dinner, my aunt noticed my grandpa caressing my thigh and told him to leave me alone and that it was weirld. What he said next haunts me till this day, it made me so unbelievably uncomfortable. He said ""I have to do it a lot now, since soon I won't be able to anymore."" He didn't mean that he was getting old. I know that, since he was only about 65 at the time. All I could think about was that he would only touch me when I was young. And honestly, how weird is that??!

But getting older I almost wished that it was true. Maybe if he only liked kids, he'd leave me alone. Even now, with my body being more like a womans, he just just doesn't stop, ever. It's even worse now that he caresses my face and talks to me like someone would to a long lost lover (and he only does it when no one else is around too).

I've talked to my friends about this and they insist that he's a creepy predator and that I should tell my parents. The problem is that I live in another country because my mom is from here, and whenever we go visit home, we always have to stay at grandpa's place.

I also don't want to make things awkward between the family, especially since I'm so quiet during family events. It'll feel like I'm just doing a disservice to everyone by outing grandpa as a creep (if he even is that? I don't know if I'm misusing the word, I'm sorry ), especially since he has a lot of money that they usually spend. 

Should I tell my parents? and if I should then how? I don't know how to begin at all...

1kvb1w2,Am I being unreasonable?,pharmalady88,I was 31 yr old when I had my first child. In my culture I am from it is common for parents to help with taking care of grandkids when my first one was born my mom stayed with me and helped for 2 yrs it was covid time so my dad also got work from home so it completely worked out.  My first was very difficult he had bad acid reflex so constant crying for 4 months it was very very hard after that he outgrew it. My mom kept saying me don’t try for another kid he is already hard to handle and I did understand her point she helped a lot and may be she did not want to got though all that again. She was constantly making me throw my sons clothes toys etc… in my heart i wanted another one.  It was covid time so husbands parents never came to help etc they live in diff country and to be honest I dont know if I could have handled them they are too much and no boundary and my husband doesn’t believe in setting it. Meanwhile my sister started to try for a kid and conceived shortly after my son turned 2.  My husband kept telling me to have another kid but in my brain now it was my sisters turn to be pampered and my mom to be attentive to her. This whole time my husband never said that he can call his parents to help with second kid if I ever had. ..  so I was under impression he expects my mom to help at-least few months again if I ever have a kid again.  But i kept pushing the idea away since I wanted to give my sister her time. Now fast fwd a little she her baby and when her baby turned 1.5 yr old she announced she is pregnant again.. my husband took it very bad that you waited for your sister and yet she proceeded with her plans and did not even consider you. Now I am 36 and feel like I wasted my time following my moms advice about one kid done and putting my sister first.  ( now found recently i have one tube blocked and only option dr gave was ivf.

But the biggest revelation or I can say betrayal we took as a family is when we found out my youngest brother had an affair with my 2nd brother's wife.

It's been like 3 years since then but still we have a lot of issues. May parent's treat it silently as always ignoring and giving the old saying magpatawad , ang dyos nga nagpatawad lahat Ng Tao nag kakamali..etc.

Until now, family is broken and p.s the kids didn't even know what really happened and he still has access to them as if the good tito.. it pains me to accept this lies and idk how to get over if I have to forget forgive of just walk away to my family.

Sincerely

1kv7wli,Need advice…family trip turned into a costly mistake,wishingwell_182,"I need some advice on a situation I’m really struggling with.
This year, I wanted to do something special for my parents and treat them to a cruise as a Christmas gift. I told them in advance so they could plan for it, and both seemed genuinely excited. My mom said “yes” right away, and although my dad didn’t say it outright, he said “sounds like a lot of fun” and went along with the idea—which both my mom and I took as a yes.

Fast forward to yesterday: I found a great Memorial Day deal through Royal Caribbean—60% off the room if you add a second guest. I booked a balcony suite for them and a separate room for myself (my mom snores, and only my dad can sleep through it). I messaged them immediately to share the good news. My mom was happy, but my dad didn’t respond.

Then this morning, he completely flipped—yelled at my mom, saying he’s “not doing that” and only went along with it to avoid being “bothered.” That hit me hard. We wouldn’t have pestered him had he just been honest from the beginning. We simply thought we were making plans together as a family.
Now I’m stuck with an extra $600 charge because removing him from the booking voided the original deal. I never would have booked it if I had known he didn’t want to go. I even tried to explain this, thinking he might understand and at least consider helping with the added cost. But he’s refusing to reimburse me, won’t apologize, and told me I “should’ve known he doesn’t want to do stuff like that”—even though everything he said earlier suggested otherwise.

I feel really hurt. I planned this out of love, hoping to create a memorable experience together, not to be left with more expense and a sense of being misled. I don’t know what to do next. Do I let it go and eat the cost for the sake of peace? Or is it fair to expect some accountability here?

1kv7luy,TW - Vent what should I do I also want my mom to heal but she is dismissive and never wants to talk about it,Crafty-Gazelle322,"I’m a 20-year-old female.
My parents divorced when I was a baby—their marriage had been arranged, and they simply didn’t like each other.

My mom has a lot of traumas and dose t wanna talk about anything related to her and my dad and I have noticed that every time I ask her regarding him or her during their relationship but she is dismissive leaves the room or simply changes the subject to something more lighthearted! 

also she remembers her childhood but not how I grew up or even my actual birth time but she vividly remembers her childhood and even says "" how can u not even remember urs when u were 7 cuz I don't remember anything tbh! 

I just want her to heal and for her to tell me everything 

but every time  I ask my mom about their relationship, I end up feeling guilty and ashamed. She once told me, “I would have chosen death over marrying your dad” 💔. I know she has her traumas, and what she said is valid, but honestly, I never even knew my dad. I don’t know what he looked like or what kind of person he was.

Nobody ever told me anything about him. He just disappeared. I was raised by both sides of the family—my mom’s and dad’s—but never by my actual parents. I was always pitied, treated like someone who constantly needed help. People would help me just to make themselves feel better. They felt bad for me, and as a child, I accepted that. I made myself fragile and pitiful without even realizing it. But now, I’m starting to see the pattern.

My grandparents are still alive, and I could ask them about my dad or maybe even see pictures of him—because I do want to know. But the problem is, I’m scared. I barely contact anyone, and I know that whenever I speak with family, it triggers me. I end up feeling horrible, guilty, and ashamed. So I try to avoid contact or keep it really brief.

I don’t want to bring up my parents’ relationship or ask questions about them, even though I know it would help me understand myself. I feel tired and emotionally drained. Every time I try to form a relationship with someone, I get reminded of all this—and then I just end it without any clear reason. People are always left confused.

I honestly don’t know anything about myself that feels solid or reliable. I feel like I was born out of hate. I just needed to get this off my chest. I want to heal from all of it—but how can I, if I don’t even know both sides of the story?

How can I ask my family members—not my mom, because she hates them (and I understand, she has valid reasons)—but how can I talk to my grandparents about my dad without my mom finding out? Every time I bring it up to her, she either shuts me down or says something so traumatic that I end up feeling overwhelmingly guilty and ashamed. So I stop asking.

Please, if you have any advice—I need it. I want to know who I am, and I want to start letting go of this guilt and shame.",1,0,1748193013.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kv7luy/tw_vent_what_should_i_do_i_also_want_my_mom_to/

1kuy7bx,Family of Cheaters,IntelligentDrink9892,"As a woman, growing up in a family of cheaters is honestly traumatizing. From my titos and titas, to cousins, my own brother, even my father. It’s hard to put into words how much that messes with your sense of trust. When the people closest to you, the ones you’re supposed to look up to, keep choosing betrayal… how are you supposed to believe in love?

It’s hard to fully trust someone when you’ve seen cheating treated like it’s normal. And it hits different when your own father and brother, the men who were supposed to protect and respect the women in their lives didn’t. It leaves this fear in you. I’m scared to fall in love. Scared to give someone all of me and end up getting hurt, lied to, or cheated on. Sometimes I ask myself, how did my mom deal with it all? How did she stay so strong when my dad was still alive? Why did she hide it from us?

Maybe she thought it was for our own good. Maybe she didn’t want us to hate him. But now that I know, it just hurts. It makes me question everything. I’ll never understand cheaters. I’ll never understand how someone could say “I love you” and still do the one thing that could break you. Because if you truly love someone, how could you hurt them like that?

Despite all of this, I’m in a relationship right now. It’s still new, but I feel happy, genuinely happy. He’s loving, caring, understanding… and I’m trying to let myself believe this could be different. It’s not easy. My guard is up more than I’d like. But I trust him. I want to believe that not everyone is like the men I grew up around.

I guess I’m just trying to unlearn everything that was wrongly taught to me. I don’t want to carry this cycle forward. I want to love fully, without fear, and I want to be loved in return, with honesty and respect.",1,1,1748163924.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kuy7bx/family_of_cheaters/

My parents confessed they never bothered to even get me screened despite having a history of autism. I’ve cried to them desperate for something.

I have horrible anxiety to start. I can’t even drive because of it. It’s a struggle to work. I’ve had days I’ve cried my eyes out in school because of it. They just brush me aside and tell me to get over myself or just breathe. Or that I’m too young and couldn’t possibly have anxiety at my age (15-17)

I have similar traits to my brother. Struggles with hygiene, intense interests that consume my everyday life, and other issues like sensory problems. I’ve never received any help since 4th grade and that was biweekly seasons with a school guidance counselor that stopped in 4th grade. While he gets an IEP, classes to help his issues, and what not.

I even struggle with math and other classes and get told I’m not trying hard enough when I’m not pushing straight As. And when I ask for help they don’t give me any as usual.

Plus he also gets away with stuff like hitting me, breaking my things, and other things I won’t say.

All my life (or what I can remember of it, elementary’s foggy and forget anything before age 6), I just haven’t had the help I feel I need. While my brother gets much more help and care for his issues plus grace.

I also feel like what if I’m just like this for attention and my parents are right and I’m just faking this all deep down and I’m over dramatic and in my own head like my parents have said.

1kuu8sa,Hypotension in grandpa causing tension - advice needed for new parents,2cats1dog1kid,"When I was 36 weeks pregnant, my father in law had a bad fall followed by a hospital stay followed by a parkinsonian disease diagnosis. Hypotension, including orthostatic Hypotension, is a current concern of his condition. For those not familiar, hypotension is low blood pressure. With his condition, this can happen at any time - not just when bending, sitting to standing, laying to standing, etc. 

There have been two instances where I had to call 911 because he went non-responsive due to his low blood pressure. I've been traumatized because at once point I had my screaming 3 month old in one hand, and in the other I was trying to stop my father in law from falling out of his chair while screaming for my husband and burning lunch on the stove. 

His disease (called multiple systems atrophy MSA) is doing generally well as long as he is taking very good care of his health, nutrition and hydration - which he doesn't do well but others take good care of him. He doesn't live with us but hasn't reported episodes of passing out for probably 6 months. 

My husband and I have requested that he not bend down to pick up our 10 month old from the floor, and to ask us and we will hand her to him. Bending over is a risk for blood pressure changes. He ignores our request and picks our daughter up all the time. He says ""im being careful"" but he doesn't understand that ""being careful"" would include asking us to pick her up. The blood pressure changes happen very quickly and he wouldn't feel them coming on. The fear is that he drops baby or falls with her in his arms. 

My husband apparently yelled at his father tonight while I was at work. When he told me the story (I'm fully on board with our request for his father), I mentioned that we are REQUESTING this from his father and that a request isn't the same thing as a boundary. My husband thinks we are setting a clear boundary but there isn't a consequence involved so im not sure we really are.

Had anyone dealt with aging grandparents and needing to set boundaries around their interactions with the babies? Anything similar? I could use advice and/or solidarity.",2,0,1748147880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kuu8sa/hypotension_in_grandpa_causing_tension_advice/

1kuol1x,where do I find a family who cares?,jgo6,"I've been physically, mentally, and sex.ually

abused from my family I live in a foreigner country and didn't meet/talk to my relatives since forever and from what I heard they're not good people and super strict so I can't ask them for help+ my sister tried to ask the for help but they just blocked her.

I have 0 relationship with my brothers one of them grew up abroad and we never even say hi. The only times I talked to him were in fights and him treating to kill me.

My other brother tried to sleep with me and I didn't talk to him since then (it's been 2 years) Qnd even tho I told my mom she didn't do anything. I even asked her to at least not let him into my room (me and my mom share a room) because it made feel so unsafe but she fought with me and told me that she won't get out of the room to talk to him because of me.

They're super religious and I don't even get to choose my clothes they literally the ones who choose it and I'm not allowed to wear anything other than what they want me to.

My family ran away from them years ago she was my only friend and my entire family and everything her leaving made it 10x harder.

I don't get financial help from them and have been working since I was 15. I just quit my last job 2 weeks ago because I'm so sick of this life. I want to find myself and feel loved.

I've been thinking about leaving them but I've seen my sister's experience and how hard life is specially that I worked myself and tried it she just

went from a misery to another kind of misery. I don't wanna make the same mistake as her even she herself tells me to not do it the same way she did.

I tried to find someone to help me so I searched for women shelter talked to them and had an interview with them and after doing so I realized that even tho I'm gonna have more freedom but feeling safe, loved, accepted, and having a warm home are not part of the deal.

I've been getting therapy for almost 3 years now

so I'm aware of myself and the thing that I found effecting me the most and the worst between everything was not having a family. Even tho I physically do but tell me why I feel so jealous and empty and find my tears running without my consent when I see a normal family I swear not even a family who's hugging or anything no not at all just them talking together and setting around each other breaks my heart I always wonder was that too much to ask?

When my friends talk to me and say ""oh my brother told me"" and continues all I think about is what? U talk with your brother? How lucky. A little note I don't remember my dad he died when I was about 3.

Writing all this together made me realize how missed up my life is and makes me laugh. After u understood the situation here's what I need.

I thought about it way too much and I've come to the solution of getting a new family. I really want a family so bad a place where I can feel safe, cared for, and part of something real. I'm not looking for financial help or anything materialistic. Just a kind family or older individuals who might be open to having someone like me in their life, even as a hosen family or just a safe space to feel at home. I'm open to helping around the house, learning new skills and even learning a new language for them.

If you know any communities or places (even

co_living situations or similar not crazy prices though bc I did search and the prices were crazy) where people welcome someone like me. I'd be so grateful for your suggestions.

1kuhcoy,My family is fucking crazy.,Comfortable-Arm2316,"I’m just gonna go for it. I’m so fucking tired of this family sometimes I just want them all dead, istg some days I imagine dealing with the grief would be easier than dealing with THEM.

Some context.
I have two older sisters, we’ll call the eldest sister rosey and the second eldest Elia. I also have an older brother who’s the oldest out of all of us, we’ll call him nick.

When I was a kid my sister, Elia, passed away in a crash. This fucked up most of us, who would react happily to a seven year olds death?

For years on end I grew up with these psychos, my older sister, rosey, who I love to pieces and I am genuinely close with her now, wasn’t that nice but I get why. She would constantly be drinking and getting in trouble with the family and police. One time she’d come home drunk and my mum was on holiday, so my aunties dealt with her. They quite literally were beating her up, keep in mind she was like 16, I had gotten it on record and the police obviously confiscated my device. I was like 7-8. Over the years from 4-12 I witnessed so many fights, so obviously it fucked me up. These fights would be between my older sister, rosey and my brother as well as between them and my mum. Like physical fights as well as screaming. 

My brother is a whole other issue. Istg he’s a psycho. He’s a big guy. He’s also been gaming for years so it gets him angry. He would spray paint the outside of the house with words like “slut” and “bitch” and “whore” towards my mum. 

I don’t know whether to bring this up but I will, when I was like 8, my brother was around 20 and he came in my room one night at around 4:30 am talking about God and then asked if I wanted big boobs to show the boys, obviously I said yes and he said “stay up till 5 and I’ll show you how to make them bigger” I don’t know if he was trying to scare me as a joke or was gonna do something but I was so scared so I went to sleep.

I never told my family about that.

Multiple times he showed up to my house, where he didn’t live anymore with a knife, threatening to kill himself. (He’s bipolar I think?)

Over the years he eventually went to prison for drugs and stayed away for around 3-4 years till I was like 15. 

He’s a manipulator and a blackmailing cunt as well! He seemed fine, even had a daughter with another psycho. He’s been fine pretty much up until now, but a last week his daughter peed on his bed and he was screaming on call with my mum, saying if she didn’t come pick his daughter up he would lock her in the bathroom but my mum was busy with me and my bestfriend and she’s has enough of him.

And now he’s threatening rosey for £30 saying she’ll find out tomorrow if he doesn’t get the money (which she put in the shed for him to get as she’s pregnant and already has a kid so logically she wouldn’t want him around)

He also used to punch me when I was a kid and always got away with it! 😁 

Obviously my mum isn’t much of a victim here, I do love her to bits but she used to neglect us and never had a good relationship with rosey. After Elia passed i guess she tried to be better but didn’t improve much. 

Anyway me and rosey are both terrified of nick, saying he’s a toddler in a grown man’s body with anger issues and is aggressive. 

I’m terrified of him and always have been. 

Honestly the whole family, both mum and dad’s side are freaks, psychos and crazy. My auntie abused and neglected her kids, then had another after losing the others to CPS, my uncle threatened to kill himself to make his wife stay and before that tried to kill himself for attention (he admitted to that).

My Nan on mums side abandoned her and then came back, my auntie on mums side has drama with rosey and neglects her kids, her youngest who’s like 9 has fake belly button piercings, laughs and smiles behind doors when baby’s get hurt, and wears super revealing clothing. 

Istg the only none fucked up person is my other auntie on dads side

I’m sorry if this is messy but I hope you guys can give me advice. I’m 16, turning 17 in a few months. I don’t want to be like them, I want to be a better person. Istg it’s like a family curse.

(And my brother says I’m not traumatised yet my sister rosey and mum were physically fighting while drunk last year and I fell to the floor sobbing and literally having flashbacks. Like I am not okay.)

1kufwf9,How do I convince my mom to leave my dad?,Solid_Garlic_9342,"This has been a recurring thought to me. My mom and I have had this conversation *multiple* times, but she'd always say it's against the Bible to divorce with your spouse. I respect that, but I just know she's as frustrated as I am. Maybe more.

I don't know if I can even convince her. But I'm just tired of seeing her cry after every time dad yells at her. And, mind you, they argue about anything—where spoons should be, how shirts should be folded, etc. No matter how minor it is, dad would make a big deal about it and blow it out of proportion.

Dad has always been a manipulative, self-centered, self-righteous, gaslighting, narcissistic person who shows a different version of himself to the public but shows his true nature to me and my mom. Personally, it's pitiful that he prioritizes his image to the public rather than how he's supposed to be as a husband and father at home.

He'd always want to prove how wrong me or my mom are no matter how many people (yes, people) tell him otherwise. It just goes to show that he'd go through lengths just to prove you wrong. At this point, he probably waits for me or my mom to make a mistake to throw it back to our faces.

I wanna emphasize how bad it is by sharing to you all what my mom said to me recently: ""I wish your father would just physically abuse me instead of verbally."" Why? So she'd be able to justify her reason to leave him.

Honestly, this post doesn't even cover a *quarter* of what dad is as a person.

I can still remember a time where I could dance, sing, play, talk and go out with my day and felt no uncomfortable about it. But now everytime, not only when my dad's around, even when my mom's around, I just make this kinda mental barrier to not expose or talk or ""be myself"" much. Like for example i can't even talk freely to my mom about the business I am currently working on. 

My behaviour as a 18year old male changes when they are around. And the I feel like if they never treated me like center of attention when I was a kid, and gave so much love and affection and just treated me normally, i might have been.... Normal. Now it just feels like all those love is long gone. I still sometimes find my dad enjoy my childhood videos but it just feels like i can't get back to it. But this problem is also becoming a big reason why I can't make much friends even tho I want to.  I know a lot of you have gone through such family situations and has found a way out of it. 

I would love to know about you and how you got out of that problem.",1,4,1748078348.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ku7hex/i_feel_like_an_outsider_in_my_own_family/

1ku328b,"Sister blew up today, threatening to not let us see her kids again",Adept_Nectarine1634,"so sorry for this long post. I’ll try to keep the background short. Sister has lots of mental illnesses, isn’t taking her medicine currently because of who knows what. Has 2 kids- aged 2 and 1. Is going through a divorce. She was over this morning at my mom’s house with the rest of my family, who all were cleaning getting ready for a party tmrw. My 2 nephews were getting into something they weren’t supposed to, and while the rest of us are trying to parent them and get them to stop, my sister (their mom) was sitting on the couch on her phone Which is a reoccurring thing that happens a lot. So my mom got aggravated and said “get off your phone and get your kids” My sister blew up. Started bawling her eyes out and screaming at my mom saying “SHUT UP STOP TALKING TO ME LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF MY KIDS. LETS GO BOYS NOBODY WANTS US HERE. GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US NONE OF YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT US” then proceeded to take her kids outside and to the car. my mom stopped her and asked if she could say goodbye to my nephew and my sister told her no and to f*** off. then threatened to not let any of us ever see her kids again, who feel like my little brothers, they’ve been at our house at least 3 times a week since they were born. i babysit them all the time. she then says “if i get in a car accident on my way home you wouldn’t even care.” then my mom threatened to call the police, scared for her and my nephews safety. anyway it died down and she went home. 

so fast forward to tonight, i check life360 and she has her location paused. never done this before so it’s out of pettiness i assume. mom then sends “goodnight girls i love you all” to our family group chat. my sister doesn’t respond and then leaves the group chat. 

i guess this is kind of a venting post but also an advice post. how do i help her? she hates her life right now, isn’t taking her medication, going through a divorce, and i just don’t know how to help. we’ve all done nothing but try to support her. it’s not fair to us for her to keep her children away from us. but i know she can as she’s their mom. i just don’t know what to do. help ",2,2,1748060404.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ku328b/sister_blew_up_today_threatening_to_not_let_us/
1ku0t0z,My twin sister and dad hate eachother.,Ok-Assumption-5445,"For context, my sister and I are teenage twins, and our family has a history of mental illness. Both my parents had traumatic childhoods, with my mom’s anxiety disorder passing on to me and my dad’s chronic depression as well. My extended family consists of alcoholics, narcissists, and abusers (Hence why I don’t have much contact with most of them). My parents, despite their struggles, have been amazing and incredibly supportive of us. I have always struggled with mental illness, got a line of disorders under my belt, but have always have supported by them. I’m transgender (ftm), somewhat alternative, and very open. My sister on the other hand is “basic” (nothing wrong W that) conservative, hates physical touch (from family only?) and has a completely different sense of humour. She’s also extremely selfish, unemphatic, and at times cruel. She’s always been very bitter toward me, constantly criticizing how I am and what I do. She’s admitted she’s embarrassed by me. She doesn’t share, then becomes enraged when I don’t either. She leaves dirty dishes in shared spaces, and doesn’t care. She has a very hard time seeing other peoples perspective, and has a very “just-world” attitude. The worst part is, she’s incredibly disrespectful to my parents. My parents spoil us in the sense that they don’t ask much from us, but anything they do ask of me I do. She doesn’t. “Can you do the dishes please?” She will wait days and days until my parents are fed up and exhausted. She’s condescending, never seeing the big deal and thinking they’re being dramatic. When she gets home, she immediately goes up stairs and gets annoyed when people bother her. She hates favours. It’s always transactional. I have to bribe her with money to have her help me. I genuinely think she might be a narcissist, but she has absolutely no idea. She thinks anything that happens to her is not her fault. Anyway, my dad has his struggles too, but I love him. He’s almost exactly like me, and we have a very strong bond. He’s a joker, like me, so we’re always goofing off. But, he’s gone through a lot of trauma and honestly? His depression seems to have gotten worse over the years. It’s very easy to tick him off, and he catastrophes over the smallest things. He has a terrible time letting things go. But he’s still very sweet, and always apologizes after. But my sister hates him. Out of all of us, she’s especially cruel to him. When we were younger, she wouldn’t hug him, and would basically avoid him. I don’t know why. Even now, she dislikes him. We had a talk in her car once and she confessed that she HATES him, and doesn’t like me either. And it’s just a natural tendency of hers. She doesn’t know why, but she just can’t stand the two of us. She doesn’t find us funny, she doesn’t get us. And she knows he doesn’t like her. She knows he loves me more. He’s always been there to comfort me when I feel hurt by her because he can relate, so I’ve never felt alone in the situation. But it’s gotten so normalized that when she says something terrible, we’d just glance at eachother, maybe smile a bit. Now, considering my dad’s kinda lethargic, he just complains about her when she’s not around. Calling her names, just absolutely done with her shit. And part of me appreciates this, because my mom won’t acknowledge her shitty behavior toward me and I need someone too. But another part of me feels that it’s wrong, and that I have an obligation toward my sister. I don’t know. I hate her. She is so unbelievably cruel to me, I don’t even consider her my sister. When I was 13, I had to force myself to lose all feelings of love toward her because her constant rejection and bitterness was destroying my mental health. I just feel uncomfortable by the fact that they both hate eachother so openly, and I’m stuck dealing with my dad’s disappointment and my sisters rage. Advice would be appreciated.",1,0,1748052687.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ku0t0z/my_twin_sister_and_dad_hate_eachother/
1ku05fl,I'm tired of being everyone's verbal punching bag,Ltheartist19,"I 24 F am currently dealing with my verbally abusive grandfather, for some background to why I'm in this situation.

Me and My Fiance 26m Lost our home in January and we were homeless for a month til my grandparents took us in we thought it was a nice gesture at first but it has become crystal clear that they never wanted to actually take us in, because ever since we have been here it has been nothing but condescending comments, fights, drama and they have expressed multiple times that they want us to hurry and get on our feet and leave, When we try to point out their toxic behavior my grandfather says ""well if you don't like it, you can leave"" knowing full well we have no where to go.

Lately the aggression and mean comments have been getting worse I've been doing my best to pull my weight by cleaning up after my animals, cleaning up the area I'm currently habiting, try to just be out of the way but he still finds issues and reasons to yell at me (he only yells at me when my fiance is at work) 

Due to a current health condition I can't work and I'm trying to get an official diagnosis, and this seems to be an issue for him because having a chronic illness seems to be a foreign concept,it doesn't help that I have 3 cousins also living here who don't work, they don't do chores, they are constantly bringing people here, even when my grandparents tell them not to, and he never says anything to them because it's their house. 

But doesn't that mean that they should be doing chores since they live here? Like what 

Ok sorry that was a long background so the reason I'm writing this is because I recently sprained my foot so I've been having trouble doing things like getting up to eat or use the restroom without being in extreme pain. (Think fire ants constantly attacking your foot)

My grandfather came home is a bad mood and started taking it out on my nana at first then when I was sitting on the toilet he decided to yell at me through the bathroom door on how ""I need to pull my weight"" and  ""get off my lazy ass"" and ""if you don't do what I want you to I'll put your cats in a shelter"" and apparently me responding to him is talking back I'm sick of walking on egg shells constantly I'm doing my best giving my chronic Illness and now my foot injury it just feels like anything I do isn't good enough and this isn't the first time he's yelled at me like this he's even threatened to take me in the front yard and beat me up. 

And me and my fiance haven't saved up enough to get out of here and I can't take this anymore my mental health is tanking to the point where I'm having some not so nice thoughts again.. I feel like I'm back in middle school is anyone else dealing with something similar? What should I do? 

For context I have 4 animals in total 3 cats and 1 dog.",1,0,1748050566.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ku05fl/im_tired_of_being_everyones_verbal_punching_bag/
1ktztrp,Celebration of life family drama,missjiji,"So I’ve (f) got two sisters and 1 brother. All of us are over 60, my Fathers Celebration of Life is coming up, we basically have all the same people in mind to invite. My Dad wasn’t very social, so a few few nearby neighbors who were kind to him, our close relatives and a few friends left from when he was married to my mom, she passed away a couple of years ago. 
 My sister in law took it upon herself to invite a brother of hers and wife, another of her sisters and her husband. The brother/wife are both overly religious and T supporters, my Dad had such a distaste for them, because of this. Saw them maybe 2 times in the last 5 years. My sister in law and my brother would also complain about them. The other sister/ husband we hardly ever saw, the last few years. Me and my sister were appalled at the invite, to where I was speechless. My sister was bold enough to speak up, saying that she didn’t think it was appropriate, and sister in law saying “what do you want me to do? Uninvite them? ….. silence.
She ended it with “No I’m not going to do that”. BTW another of my sister in laws sister and husband were invited. They’ve been a part of the extended family more so. Dad liked them.
I’m torn. Also, we’re POC they’re not. If that makes a difference.

1ktyifo,My whole family thinks I’m the trouble child because of my mum,Random29225,"Hi I 21F have been bullied and treated poorly my whole life by my family.

I am the eldest child of 2, me 21F and sister 19F. As a child I used to want to be friends with 19F and in all the pictures you could see it, I would cuddle her and try and play with her hair and I would try and just love her, eventually over time we started becoming disconnected, she always wanted to be with our mum and it used to be that our dad was a very tough and strong man, he was strict and taught us everything we know but we used to fear him because of that. My sister when she was at home with dad and I she would be in the other room or on her device, where as I used to want to watch movies with him and wanted to understand him, as time went on I can see now I probably tried to hard, I always wanted to be the best child I could be and I can honestly say that I tried so hard. At home when I was around 11 and my sister was 9 that's when things started changing, my parents would call me a liar all the time and I would rarely lie and my mum would send me to my aunts because in her words ""I can't deal with her"" but my sister would stay at home. When I was supposed to go on excursions for school they would do small things like not letting me have money but letting her have money or sometimes I just wasn't allowed to go.  

As we got into high school I distanced myself from my family, I got social media and I started making friends but I was never allowed to go to party's so people slowly stopped inviting me. I started to become depressed as I watched my sister go to boy girl party's and sleepovers and my parents would always tell me it's because I never got invited, 1 day when I did get invited I had to take the blame for a friend for a friend when she got in trouble with a teacher and my parents stopped me from going. When I met my now husband things got worse, I was told that he was bad for me and that they didn't like him because he ate too much chocolate and random excuses and soon after that is when I started distancing myself even more I would spend nights at my husbands mums house when we were 17. As the years went on my parents hated that I wasn't there anymore so they offered to let me live on a granny flat on their property but that was the worst thing for me. My dad made a contract that had rules for my living there, I wasn't allowed my husband over at all, I had to be at the house 5 nights a week, I couldn't have any visitors day at the granny flat, I didn't have a washing machine so I had to wait for them to be there to do it and if they went away I couldn't wash my clothes. Failure to do any of these things would end up with me getting kicked out. This is when I realised how controlling they were, my sister meanwhile drove 2-3 hours to meet some guy who she ended up dating, during this time she would never be home, she would not listen to anyone but mum and dad didn't care. The rules for me and the roles for her were completely different. My mum and dad then wanted to open a business and offered it to my sister and he boyfriend, I begged them to give me a chance and instead after about 6 months in the house they kicked me out so that my sister and her new boyfriend could move in, I was sick at the time and I asked them to wait because I couldn't do it, they then changed the locks, through my stuff into rubbish bags and locked it in their garage saying I need to get it off them and that I am disowned because they didn't want me. I got my things and left and moved in with my nana and my husband for about 6 months on and off. 
Then as we were visiting my grandfather my mum called saying my dad passed away, my husband and I drove 3-4 hours at night down to my mum, my mums whole family was there and they controlled everything, they didn't let my husband in with me, they made me leave after a period and I had nothing to do with the funeral, I also found out a bunch of dads old friends didn't even get invited to the funeral because mum didn't want to. I agreed to try and help mum during this time by cleaning and doing what I can and no sooner then I arrived I got kicked out because 1 day my sister had a panic attack because I moved her washing basket into her room while I was cleaning the bathroom. She ended up scratching up my arm, screaming at me, spitting at me, and she pushed me and then as she was about get in my face I pushed her down onto her bed and told her to stop and calm down, she then ran out of the house and cried hysterically in her car somewhere, when I called mum it was immediately my fault and I should never have done the cleaning and I should never have spoken to her even though I was asked to clean and try and fix things with her. 
Mum kicked me out the next week saying that I was causing too many problems, I then asked her if she had noticed how this is a form of attention seeking manipulation, and she told me to stop lying to make my sister seem bad and things were never like this when I was gone and I need to go. 

I left and I haven't spoken to mum since in person and I moved away with my husband, mum still screams at me over text and gets angry at me over text but I don't know what to do.
I've spoken to some of dads old friends who mum was rude to and they told me they noticed the favouring of my sister over me. 

I'm honestly just exhausted.

1ktybnl,"She missed my flight, left my graduation early, and made it all about her—do I cut her off for good?",starryslp,"I graduated with my master’s degree this weekend and it’s something I’ve worked incredibly hard for. I paid for my family to fly out. My older sister missed her flight despite me begging her to show up to the airport early. No apology, just excuses.

She eventually made it to the ceremony—but late—and then left halfway through, taking my nephew, brother in law, and sister with her. They very much enabled her in this scenario. I never saw them afterward. No hugs, no celebration, no pictures. I watched my classmates take photos with their families while I was alone on one of the most important days of my life.

Since then, she’s minimized everything. She blamed her toothache for leaving the ceremony, said we could take pictures “later” (in the dark, rain, after she left me crying), and now she’s texting me about whether I’ll get her portion of the flight refunded so I can give her the money.

I’ve been blaming myself which I know is so distorted. I kept thinking maybe if I was enough and worth showing up for, she would’ve done so. But I think I’m done. I’m tired of feeling invisible. I’m tired of grieving a sibling relationship that never existed the way I hoped it would. I have the opportunity to move and never speak to my family again. But going no contact terrifies me. I love my nieces and nephews and I feel like I’d be abandoning them.

I know this isn’t sustainable. I just don’t know how to stop blaming myself, or how to start healing without carrying the guilt.

I have felt uncomfortable around my dad for a very long time like since I can remember , I don’t like going in the same room as him or sitting next to him and I constantly try to get away from him or face in the opposite direction and not make eye contact. This is because I have a gut feeling that he has previously sa’d me or that he’s going to and I can feel it physically to, it’s just a deeply uncomfortable feeling I get when I’m around him and I just feel disgusted being anywhere near him. I refuse to talk to him or let him pick me up from work etc because I am scared of him.

Today it got even worse and I had a panic attack and couldn’t breathe properly, I stayed in my room the rest of the day not eating drinking or moving,basically just hiding from him just because I had to go in his car as my mum is in hospital so she couldn’t pick me up.,this has happened before. When I got home I overheard my dad and mum talking and he was saying that “It p1sses me off that she says that because I’m actually hard to get” and then he said that he’s more “popular” than me because his face doesn’t look like mine..
This has just kind of stuck with me and I find it a very weird reaction .

My brother had drug induced physcosis not long ago and he said he remembered my dad dr#gzing and r.ping him and me when we were younger . Although he was in physcosis I don’t believe those memories just came out of nowhere but I’m not sure, and to be honest when he told me I wasn’t shocked and I did believe him. But then my mum and dad obviously denied this and he went to hospital.

1ktrv81,ADVICE - Do i drop my golden child 28f loving parents?,Training-Mastodon-48,"
Hi all, 

I am looking for advice. Sorry for the length, poor formatting and everything else. 

TLDR - My golden child loving parents yet again chose everyone except . 

I really do not know where to begin. My family have a golden child f28 GC and myself f31. We live on a very expensive island. Since turning 18 my parents made my pay £400 a month in rent while I lived with them which is fair enough. And anything i borrowed i would have to payback with interest. Since prior to turning 20 i have not borrowed anything. Maybe not so fair. GC on the other hand they pay her rent each month since 18, her horses livery and Living expenses. Last year the VERY conservative figure was over 500k excluding education fees, she went to uni i didnt ect.

We have only since I turned 30 been back in contact. After a 4 year silence just to there actions / in actions and selfishness. 
A recent example of this is we have a freedom celebration on  the island and this year marked a hugely significant number. They have a parade with old cars, my parents have recently purchased one which is a 3 seater and ment this would be the first year in the parade. It was going to be my grandmother and parents in the parade. The week before my mother told my partner that my nan was not going to be in the 3rd seat and my sister was returning for a week for the celebrations. I was not told and it was all made to be like it was last minute. Yes they paid for her return. We went and watched the parade. She was in the back in costume which given her height would have to be a custom order. It was all planned. 

I will mention  when we started talking again I was given the few years of birth and Christmas presents missed as a gift which was very nice and 2.5k. I am mentioning this clairty as unfortunately despite being a jan birthday. They only remember every 3 years.  

My mother informs me that GC and I are both treated equally and if she spends something on a gift or lends more to me. She sends GC the same amount. 


 My Partner m46 and myself were looking to purchase, my grandparents family home that my grandfather built. It is currently indeed of alot of work and has been vacant for over a year. We offered them a substantial amount for us. The house is worth about 650k in its current state. Their delusional asses think that they can get 900k and we offered our max of 650k thinkng we are family and they would be happy for it to stay in the family. They turned us down because they full amount. We said okay what about the 650k and we pay an extra amount each month to make up the difference. I think this is fair. We get laughed at. 

This house is where I spent the vast majority of my childhood. Both parents would work full time. I have happy memories because it was by the sea and we would go the beach for adventures and explore everywhere. 

At the end of last year GC returned to the island and the next day the next day the house was pulled from the market. My parents didn't tell us until 3 days ago. We found out the day it was pulled from other sources but acted like we didn't know to see how long they would keep it up. The answer 6 months. Okay we didn't need to know but we asked them if they had viewings and offers and they lied to us. 

They issue i have with this is i love this property. I really want to be able to purchase it. 

They only see money and when my grandmother dies, which given her deteriorating health will not be long. They are going to gift the property gc or sell it and gifts her a significant amount of money from the sale. There are so many things that they have given her that I will never get the same.

I am at the point I want to burn the bridge and walk away. They make no effort to talk to me and only talk to my partner even on thing he doesn't understand such as my parents and I work in finance, my partner doesn't so they talk to him about finance stuff and ignore me. 

My Partner who had a bad childhood and is now all his family are gone says I am going to regret burning the bridge. 

What would you do in this situation?

1ktqecv,My family is broken,Secret-Spend-6406,"(My first post btw) I (16f) is part of a family of 5. My dad, my mom, my little brother (12yo) and my big sister 18(yo). I am the middle child. When I grow up I thought my family was just like any other families. I thought that fighting everyday countless times a day was normal. I always had some social problems and when I grew up I start have a lot of anxiety attacks and was diagnosed with intense social anxiety to the point I couldn't go out of my room or else I would have an anxiety attack, eye contact was the scariest thing, I could NOT do it. I stayed at my room going out only at night where everybody was asleep to get some food. My parents did not understand me a bit. My parents aren't necessarily bad people which makes it even worse...  they do want the best for me but.. my father always talks about ""discipline!"" He always says ""it's all about discipline!"" He thought that I wasn't going to school and just staying in my room because I'm lazy. He has ocd and anger issues DOES TWO DO NOT WORK TOGETHER WELL if you dare to accidentally spill a drop of water He will go into a fit of rage! Even if you try to calm him down and tell him that you will clean that yourself he will just scream at you and tell you that he will deal with it and that you should just go to your room. I don't blame my dad. My dad grew up as one of 3 brothers and his mom (my grandma) had died when he was 7 years old leaving only his brothers and his father (my granpa) who wasn't around much. He also had social difficulties when he was a child and never had many friends. He refused to get help such as therapy for hus trauma, ocd and anger issues. My mother is a kind person who always trues to keep the family together but she has a problem with overreacting. Both my parents are like a ticking boom and you never know when they'll start to burst. Ironically that made me the child always the one who tries to calm my parents down. My big sis had hit me a lot when I was younger and I grew up scared of her as now we don't talk to each other At ALL, actually she quit distant from all of us and never around. my little brother and I are similar and I'm afraid he's going in the same direction as me as lately he starts to stay in his room a lot, my parents are dilling with him the same way they dealt with me... NOT GOOD!

1ktmv5r,Mother wont watch grandaughter unless paid every time,Connect-Weekend-594,"So my mom is a SAHM. I used to live an hour away from my family, but recently moved back close to family for work. I was told when i moved back, i would have the support, and help needed for my daughter. I am a single mother, the father is still in my daughters life and is a great dad. I get her one week, he gets her the next. We both work day shift so we usually need someone to watch her during the summer while we work (or if its during the school year and she cant make it to school). My mom waited until about a month or so after moving to let me know that she now requires payment any single time i need a babysitter (even if its just for a few hours, time doesnt matter to her), and the same goes for my daughters dad. We both have to pay her. Where i am on a very tight budget, i literally cannot hardly afford to anything extra, let alone 50/60 bucks a week. She has told me she is sticking to it and will not watch her unless she is paid. She said she feels entitled to compensation because she is providing a service to us, which i do understand, but yanno i kinda thought she would understand that i can't afford it. Well now, my daughters father had to have a babysitter (because my mom offered to watch her today and yesterday) and he has apparently not given her any money and now my mother is asking me where the money is and who is responsible for her payment. Her and the father do not get along well (my mother is an actual narcissist), so im just waiting for this to all blow up..ive always seen other families including the fathers family never charge for watching their own grandchilden, i didnt think that was going to be a thing with her. Also for context i provide everything my daughter needs including food when she is over at my mothers house, so thats not an issue. Is my mom being ridiculous? Or is it just me?",4,17,1748015179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ktmv5r/mother_wont_watch_grandaughter_unless_paid_every/
1ktladq,Controlling family,Relevant-Algae-5704,"Hi guys, I really need your help. I've been helped on here before, so I have hope.

My family has a lot of control of me. I don't like to press their buttons or make them feel left out, left out of society. They have trouble socializing and don't understand simple concepts, so they do whatever they can to take those concepts away from me. I don't know how to ignore them, my heart just crushes. It's a very bad dynamic because I pretty much do everything they say, even when it hurts myself. I'm an empath and am extremely selfless...I've signed up for therapy for highly sensitive people but that doesn't start til May 27th. Any advice on how to cope with a broken family? I don't want to make them feel insecure or less than. They already feel that way. I can't keep throwing myself in the trash for them...it's hurting me and destroying my life one day at a time. My life is destroyed. My fashion is destroyed, my dancing is destroyed, they are destroying everything I love and am good at. I've always learned things very quickly...I'm just born like that. They don't understand the simple concept on how to live. Life is so fun and so simple, yet they crack it open with all this depressing stuff. I really need help. How do I deal with this malfunctioned family. There's gotta be a solution. I can't be the only one outshining them and making them look bad. And the fun niest part is, they feel so powerful doing this. How do they not realize they don't know how to do anything good...Even worse they try to make me bow down to them and stuff. It's REALLY bad...I'm not sure how to deal with this. Clearly I dont want to but I would just...I dont know I dont know where to go. I'm 27 and live with them because I'm on medication and it makes it hard for me to leave/work. They have full control over me. I just need advice. SOMEBODY'S gotta help me.

1ktjvjq,I want to leave,fievrats2308,"Using a throwaway account because I don't want this linked to my main.

I am 22f from India. I live with my brother (27M), mother (49F) and father (54M). Living with your parents tilk you get married is kind of the norm here. My family has always had a lot of issues. It's always felt like everything's held together by a thread that could snap at any moment.

Last month when my Grandpa died (mom's dad), my parents had a huge fight (mostly dad screwed up), and then I shifted to Grandma's place to keep her company for a bit so she doesn't spiral out by herself. 

I stayed at her place for almost 2 months before she left to stay with my uncle's family for a bit. While at her place, I had a lot of peace and quiet and no family drama or tension or tip toeing around everyone's feelings. I didn't have to worry that one wrong word would make my dad or my brother blow up. I didn't have to keep checking whether whoever I was talking to was actually listening to what I said. I didn't have to sit and listen to a constant barrage of useless unsolicited advice when I just want to vent. 

I shifted back home after Grandma left. They've always fought and stuff but, I now wake up every morning to raised voices and yelling in the kitchen between my dad, my mom and my brother. I have to deal with my parents constantly cribbing to me about what the other did or said or didn't do or didn't say. I have to worry that one word will lead to my dad or my brother blowing up. I've lost my peace. I had peace for the first time and then I lost it. I tried talking to my brother about it but he tries to play it down saying it's not as bad as I think it is.

I've tried telling my parents that I'm not their therapist or their marriage counselor and to stop treating me as such. But they don't seem to get it. They keep venting and cribbing and expect me to pick sides. To them, this is all a normal part of being a family. They don't seem to understand that they are one team, not two and that they certainly shouldn't be taking jabs at each other and trying to score one over the other. 

All of them love me and treat me like the baby of the family but honestly, it feels suffocating to keep living with them. I want to leave and move out or something but circumstances make it so that I can't leave for a while atleast. I also considered therapy, but we don't have the money for it and they wouldn't go for it nor would they let me go for therapy because they 'don't believe in stuff like that'. They think therapy is for weaklings. I want to be able to protect my peace until I reach a point where I can shift out, but I don't know how. I would appreciate any advice/insights anyone has to offer.",2,2,1748007721.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ktjvjq/i_want_to_leave/
1ktjv56,Anger towards my dad,lucky-star25,"I (F18) was raised by my aunt who I refer to as my mother. After my parents got divorced my dad married a woman who I loathe with every fibre of my being. She has two daughters from a previous marriage Anna (19) and Kate (17). My father currently has 4 children with my stepmom. They’ve all hurt my brother and I in different ways. I love my father and I don’t think he’s ever had bad intentions towards us. However, I do believe that he prioritised them and never considered my feelings. He always has something negative to say about me. Whenever we see each other I don’t feel like I can be myself in front of him. He doesn’t agree with how I dress and it bothers me because he says it’s because he’s “looking out for me” but I don’t think that’s the case. I think he just doesn’t want his reputation to be affected. If he was looking out for me he would’ve been there when my Anna attempted to rape me. When she harassed me whenever I’d go over to their place. Whenever I’d face problems with my stepmom he should’ve defended me instead of siding with the a grown ass woman rather than his own 6 year old daughter. I’m tired of all of this. He’s attempting to fix (some) things now. I want things to get better but I cannot get over all that I’ve gone through. And I know I’ll always end up being hurt at the end of the day.

1kteq5i,AITA for refusing to have a relationship with my half-sister?,,"I'm 34. My parents divorced when I was 12. My dad cheated on my mom with his secretary—who, in a twisted turn of events, was also her ""friend."" They’re still together. I have a younger sister (27) from my mom and dad.

There’s no one I hate more than his wife. She took over our family home—trashed every memory with her awful interior design—and made it impossible for me to have a normal relationship with my dad. Being around her is so uncomfortable that I rarely visit.

She made my life hell. When I was 14, I found out she was cheating on my dad. I confided in my school friends, and one of their parents—who knew her—told her what I said. She spun it so well that my dad nearly kicked *me*, a teenage girl, out of the house. That’s how manipulated he was. He didn’t, but our relationship has been strained ever since.

She’s always been obsessed with looking “hot”—working in their restaurant in the shortest skirts and flaunting what little cleavage she had. Even my grandad once joked her skirts looked more like belts. The town was full of rumours about her affairs, and honestly, I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted out. I moved to another country not long after—still the best decision I ever made.

She used to say she never wanted kids because it would “ruin her body.” But then she had one. My guess? To secure her grip on our family’s estate. Because if it were up to me, she’d be out on the street the same day my dad passes.

Their daughter—my half-sister—is now 9. She’s just as toxic. The town talks about her, and not kindly. She's rude to everyone, adults included, and even my family agrees she’s unbearable. Last summer, after one of her tantrums, my dad told her off. She snapped back: “If you hate it here so much, why didn’t you just stay married to Ms. L?” (my mom). She’s clearly echoing things her mother says.

Her comments always seem aimed to hurt. Before I lost weight, she’d target that. I know she’s a child, but all I see is a mini version of her mother—and I can’t stand her. I’ve *tried*. I really have. But I just can’t fake it anymore.

She’s horrible to other kids too—picking fights, calling them slurs. It’s not normal behavior, even for a 9-year-old.

So here I am: an adult who can’t stand her own half-sister. I know she’s a kid. I know I’m grown. But am I a horrible person for feeling this way?",9,1,1747990231.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kteq5i/aita_for_refusing_to_have_a_relationship_with_my/
1ktbadi,Parents hate each other and its fucking up my life,Frequent_Exam_5501,"You dont have to read it but my life is fucked in my eyes lmfao (Yap session)

Now im (16m) going to start, Ive only liked a few, few people in my family, and my family is big. Either they are full on sketchy people, have mental disorders, or are too old to even count to ten. This goes for my parents, since they, and they only have been fucking up my life, and little brother's life.

Now I dont hate my lil bro, dont get me wrong, but since hes still young, hes gotten on my nerves but he still looks up to me and we do get along pretty good. Although my parents, dad specifically, has been taking anger out on him, for no reason (Ill get into the many reasons why my dad, has fucked up my family)

Now my dad has never been perfect, or a good influence. Although he had a shitty childhood doesnt mean he gets to fuck up mine and my lil brothers life. He has sold drugs with his cousin, stolen, (probably) drunk, never finished school, etc, while he was young, although he did have divorced (mother/stepdad religious, dad was a gambling addict), and was mostly influenced by his dad which caused him to run away from both of them at 16, meaning he never finished school. (Refuses to get GED even now, almost at 47)

He met my mother at 25 (she was 18, pretended to be 19) and they got along. A decade and a bit later, they had me (lil bro like 5 years later), and they were working shitty, nowhere-leading jobs, so they started a legal business (Im not gonna doxx myself) around 2014 so they could take care of us and WFH, since my grandparents old-age and mental-problems had been ramping up. It was a struggle and they sacraficed things, but it did make them somewhat good money (lower middle class type money) so we had a nice house, food, entertainment, all that. Come 2015, my dad was cheating..? Or texting, I dont really know but Ive seen the screenshots of it and my mom put a end to it by getting the husband of the cheating wife to stop texting my dad (my dad&mom werent married till early 2020's due to student loans might affect business and such)

After that ordeal, they went on, as normal, until near the summer of 24, I thought life was going great, I had just gotten out my sophomore year, and was relaxing, but my parents spending entirely fucked us. My dad spent over 1500$ at 3 different gas-stations/stores just for beer. BEER. Within a goddamn month which fucked us. So then hes been getting drunk, beginning to ask me for money (I wonder where my 400$ went, heh) and so, our food started to look like were living on 50$ a day, and my parents arguing got out of hand. My dad has been physically abusing my mom, although she does instigate it (There is 200% something mentally wrong with the BOTH of them) but yeah. Ill list some things of what hes done to my mom
- Pointed a gun (not sure loaded or not)
- Made her eye bleed (pretty sure he slammed her into a door
- Lighted her hair on fire with cigerate
- Brusied multiple areas on her body
- Pulled her hair
Im not gonna continue to type them but you get the point. Theres more for fucks sake too 

So my mom told his family (theyre weird, some support her, then they dont, like what? My dads mom is the religious one and my grandma is just downright dumb. Unless my dads brainwashed her, then yeah, people do have opinions though) After that theyre arguing has ramped up even more and my dad has threatened to ■■■■ himself 3+ times. Crazy. My mom got his cousin to come get him (his cousin wanted him baker acted. Baker acted. Jesus)

So now, we're living on barely any food, due to his 4 beers a day and (their) 3 packs of cigerates every 3 days (Mom smokes to not feel hungry. Like bro) although they dont smoke inside, they smoke anywhere else (you dont shit where you sleep).

Ive given up. Ive almost called the cops three times now, and I might just get CPS involved. Id rather go through a foster home rather than living on the streets with two pyschotic individuals. Im not going anywhere near anyone in my family after im 18. Its probably gonna be a nice permanent trip to Europe (Just since I wanna explore the culinary side over there) or greenland.

I recently got a job and have been gone for several hours (Thank you lord) since I dont have to be near them. Although my mom has been completely using me as a therapist and asked me the same question 5 different times each car ride home. I hate it. And I do plan to get a second job. Yes im working 4-11, Yes ill work more when I become used to waking up with a alarm clock.

Anyways if you can just answer this one question: Do I call CPS? Im not trying to risk my job/school or anything but I do not want to be here anymore with my crazy parents.

1kt4fix,Failure to Launch Brother,wandering56789,"My brother is 35 years old. He has lived with our parents for most of the past decade. He has had a few jobs in that time, but usually just for a few months and then he quits for a reason like ""it wasn't a good fit"". He is bright and capable, does not really have any social limitations or real disabilities. We grew up in an affluent family perhaps with too much of a safety net and he has never quite been able to get on his own two feet (unlike the rest of my siblings). He's even gotten married in that time and has a lovely partner who is a hard worker, though does not work a job that pays enough to support them. 

Anyways, my mom does not choose to kick him out because they are codependent and also she doesn't want to see him struggle even though deep down she knows he needs a push. I have an intense career and work incredibly hard, trying to build the life I envision for myself and my family. I know this is my decision yet seeing how he seems to get a ""free pass"" and everything is taken care of for him, is causing a ton of resentment from myself toward him and toward my mom as well. It is tarnishing our once close and loving relationship and I barely have a relationship at all with him any more. I also just hate to see him throw his life away.

1kt1zvq,I am so ashamed of myself,Top-Struggle-9315,"As far back as I can remember I was always the quiet one, I was the first child and my mother was inexperienced so all she could do was take me to therapy and make me a sibling because she thought I was lonely. I love my dad very much but for the last few years he has only been working out of town. I currently live with my two younger sisters and my mother, but I feel disgusting. I think my mother is a sadist but I don't want to blame her, the symptoms are right in front of my eyes but I think what if I'm seeing it wrong. I think about what if I'm a liar like my mother says, and I'm scared. My earliest memory of my mother showing another side was years ago when I ran away from a small dog and fell. Since I fell face down, the entire left side of my face was abraded, not deep but large. When I came home crying, my mother immediately started to clean the wound, but while I was crying, I suddenly heard my mother say, ""Your crying voice is disturbing."" I felt terrible. When I told my mother later, she called me a liar. The reason why I feel so bad right now is because my phone is pretty old. I need a new one because my father had this phone for years before me and I've had it for quite some time now so it's considered an antique. I didn't want to be a burden to my family because I knew that whenever I asked them for something, they would postpone it. I started looking for part-time jobs, found a bunch of good ones, and finally told my mom. She told me not to be stupid and that she didn't trust those big businesses, we had a little fight. Then, just two days ago, the woman who had postponed all my requests because she had no money offered to pay me the monthly amount I wanted. I immediately declined because I was already looking for a job so as not to use my family's money. After about an hour she asked me why I had such a stupid idea of looking for a job. I felt ashamed but I told her, ""I don't want to save the money from your shopping for a year just to buy something I need."" I should note that these are all our messaging. After I sent the message, the disappointed face my mother made flashed before my eyes for a moment. I've been crying ever since because I don't understand. Is it this woman who gets angry at me for not hugging her and raises her voice and then doesn't talk to me for hours who is the problem or am I the one making everything a problem? I know I explained it very superficially, but I didn't want to make it too long since English is not my first language anyway. I just don't understand why he is such a mean but sincere person, why does my mother only smile at me when it's her way and act like she hates me at the slightest mistake. All I want is to be able to get the electronics I need faster and not be a burden to my family. I hate myself for this but my mother makes me sick to my stomach, her every move makes me feel disgusted. Sometimes I want her to die, but I know my siblings would be deeply affected if she did. I can't stand her but I feel sorry for her because I feel like I'm a burden to her. ",2,0,1747947982.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kt1zvq/i_am_so_ashamed_of_myself/
1kt1djw,Minor dispute (sorry for long post),Bright-Information34,"This isn't a huge thing, they've mostly never physically hurt me, but I live with my grandparents, my aunt, and my sister, and feel like I get zero respect. For some background, although I'm graduating soon, I'm still the youngest (and therefore the ""least important""). I'm also a trans guy (haven't formally come out but they definitely know, if they didn't they wouldn't be trying so hard to make me act like a woman). This is a Christian family of old people, so of course they're like this.

My sister isn't too bad, she's the most understanding but still kind of just brushes me off. She at least calls me by name and tries not to be insensitive. This post specifically isn't about her. 

My aunt... well, she does have down syndrome, so I really can't blame her, but I always need to be so nice to her and if I offend her slightly, everything is taken away. She's allowed to cry and scream and shout with no repercussions, but I get punished just for having a neutral resting expression. She's just so entitled, and is the only exception to the ""never hurt me"" thing, she has hit me before and as a child (like 6 or 7) when I used to get too rowdy she used to pin me down by sitting on my stomach and biting my neck. She's also said some creepy comments and touched my ribs way too often, but I don't know if I can blame her because of her disorder. She loves to be touchy and call me nicknames, and I hate it. Telling her to stop, though, makes her cry and I get punished. I'm not allowed to set boundaries with them.

My grandfather isn't horrible. We bond pretty well, and up until recently we used to work in the garden together, just the two of us. Now he can't walk as well, but he still tries when he can. It's just that sometimes I offend him without realizing and then he just shuts down in regards to me and stops saying anything to me, he sometimes ignores me or is cold to me for days (he still feeds me, don't worry, also I can cook so there's no danger of that). He does seem to think I'm too frail and is overprotective like he'd be to a baby, but also wants me to grow up right away. He used to yell a lot when I was small, but he's mellowed out now. I've also noticed that he doesn't really respect me ir my interests, but that's still more than some people in this family.

My grandmother is who this is mainly about, and she is probably the worst. She shows some narcissistic tendencies based on the way she acts toward me. She's deceptively nice sometimes, especially around guests, and can be so caring and thoughtful that it's almost possible to forget how she is. As soon as the guests leave, all bets are off. She always expects everything to be done her way, immediately, without complaint and without anything in return. If I say even one thing wrong, phone is gone. I'm not joking. She once took it away for half a year because I forgot to do the damn recycling. She always asks me for my opinion on things, but the only one I can really say back to her is her own. Things with her have gotten really bad, because she never leaves me alone. She's always on my tail for something, never giving me a second to recharge or relax. Thing is, I hate interacting with people and I need my alone time. It's not just little nagging. It's constant, every day, all day. It's gotten to the point where I don't want her to touch me, don't want to be near her. I can't stand her voice. I get fidgety and aggressive for no reason around her. I'll admit that I did SH and had some really bad thoughts for a long time because of her (I still do, sometimes), but every time I bring it up, she says that I'm fine. She tells me that it's all for attention, both the mental issues and being trans. If it was for attention, the trans thing would have stopped a long time ago because of the constant bullying I get at school and literally only having two close friends left to help me deal with it. If she were gone, most of these issues would be sorted out. She's manipulative as heck and a horrible person to be with for more than twenty minutes. Everything I do with her is wrong. It would be fine if she treated all of us like that, but no. She's a perfect mother to my aunt, so permissive and nice. It's just my sister and I who get tossed to the wayside, since we're not useful. She finally got me to a therapist, but refuses to believe she's the reason for the necessity of one.

Is it just me though? Should I try to be more reasonable and tolerate this? How do I tolerate it, then? Please, it's just been getting so difficult. What can I do without getting in trouble? Telling them outright to stop or fighting at all will surely get me harshly punished.

1kt0htz,I'm the black sheep and my dad is dying,Easy_Armadillo_8426,"My father criticized me my entire life and I tried over 40 years to heal it. He is a narcissist person. I'm always, ugly, stupid and wrong.
Long story short , my dad treated my mom the same. They divorced when I was 12, he moved out of state. My mom died when I was 17. He never Once asked if he could help me. I was an only child and my aunt and uncle, his brother who lived less than 1 hour away Never offered help either.. About that time my dad had me meet his then girlfriend, now wife. I actually got married a few months before he did. I continued to try to have a healthy relationship with him, which never happened. Cut to many years now and he is getting to the point where he could die soon.
I've been texting his wife, who has always heard whatever story about me he's told her all these years.
I can't fly without getting tubes in my ears, I have several health issues and tubes for one flight isn't worth it .. Otherwise I would have flown to see him long ago. They use to come here. Always awkward and of course still critical of me and even my health conditions are my fault ( autoimmune). I text her at the beginning of the month to wish her a good month and say hi to him. I was going to send photos of me or do video calls she said no they would confuse him ( he's got dementia) ..I never received a text from her.  Until recently, I have vultures who lay eggs in the barn and shared it with her .That opened the door for her to text me first!
Here's the issue, if I could fly I would have done so Way before his memory got bad . I don't know what to do when he passes. I can't fly or drive ( chronic pain,etc) . We're just after 35+ yrs beginning to text which is nice.i tried over the years talking to her when I called but she always Said she had something in the oven. Now we're finally connecting, but I know I'm going to make her mad again for not going to the funeral.Shes aware of my condition and that I can't travel 
What do I do? I don't know how to comfort her given the relationship I had with him. It's weird, even texting know about the animals she says how good I am with them .well that's because of my Mom not my dad who's never been much into animals..it's just awkward and I have to be careful what I say 
I need some advice on how to handle her grief, without saying too much 
To me he's been a cold man and not a loving father at all. I have a half brother I reconnected with..I'm Always the one who has to reach out.

1ksz2r7,Eviction notice,Lonely_Panic_8785,"Okay so I was raised by my grandparents since 11yrs old, 20 now. Since then I've always had issues with my grandparents playing favorites, for example when I was young after my parents left I got really depressed and long story short they treated me like I was crazy and had absolutely no reason for feeling sad bc "" my parents were bad people"". Then proceeded to help my sister and send her to therapy. 

At 17 I ended up moving states and moved in with my boyfriend, about a year later I ended up getting pregnant and moved back home ( my grandparents have a small place they rent out right next door to them)  by my 3rd trimester.

After I had my baby absolutely none of my family helped me or even came by to check in on me, I either had to come to them or they came when they finally decided to see my grandma and just came to mine after for maybe 10 minutes. I ended up have a falling out with my little sister bc we were hanging out and I brought up that no one helps me,( at the time she was baby sitting 3 days A week for maybe 2-3 hours while I worked before my boyfriend got home, but also complained about having to help me constantly) I told her that my older sister got an huge amt of live and support when she had my niece and I was sick of getting no help from anyone or even just someone to come be with me while I learned how to be a mom. After that a couple of days later, she refused to babysit anymore bc ""it's just extra money for you"", mind you my while family is broke so that was just completely untrue, I was able to pay my bills and get some little stuff like fast food or some clothes if I wanted. 

After are falling out everyone in the family became more distant with me. Almost a year later my brother and his girl try to convince our grandparents to kick us out and let them move in, which they were going to if I didn't talk my grandma out of it. And right before that my older sister texted me and said she had no time to help and count watch my baby( she  started watching my baby on Tuesdays for like max 3 hours before my boyfriend gets home), and then took it back an hour later and said it was just her period. Lol what??

Recently my grandma had her friend move into their house with them and she ended up backing into my parked car, so of course I got my boyfriend and asked him to come look and everything. He went looked found that we couldn't open our drivers side door so we had to do it thru insurance, he went in asked for insurance ( he was frustrated but kept is cool), and then my grandmas friend saying she didn't do all of it, whatever that means, so he calls me over and I say we need to figure this out and me grandma immediately starts yelling and telling me my boyfriend came in there ""like a bat out of hell"", and proceeded to yell so I told her to look at my son who was standing right next to me and that she needed to stop yelling. After we got the insurance and left bc they were still yelling. 
A week later they home over with my brother and his girlfriend and proceeded to tell me that we are being evicted, and need to be out by July 1( my brother has to get a new apartment in July) 

I'm trying to get longer now so we can save, but they are being stubborn and even had explain that we can solve this in court if needed, bc this is retaliory and us against Texas state law. I've tried low income housing and they all have waiting list or are noonher accepting applications. I'm applying for tanf rn but hope it comes in timeand we get approved. 

I just need a little validation that I didn't cause this, and maybe a little help if anyone knows anywhere cheap around Denton, TX

1ksxomo,Family falling apart,gravesinger___,"I am 21F. I originally moved out when I turned 18 due to issues with my mom. After 2 years of barely any contact and struggling my dad showed up one day. I broke down in tears explaining everything with bad roommates, how I pay for everything and take care of them. And he offered for me to move back in. I moved back in shortly after my 21st birthday when my lease ended. At first everything was fine, I’m working full time(anywhere between 40-70 hours a week) and I take classes at night. I’m barely home, I don’t get to see my parents or sisters much. 

After going to therapy for several years I’ve realized my mom has been trying to create this perfect mother image so she can boast to everyone. She’s the type to post about how proud she is of us but outside of social media she shames us for our career choices, shames us for our interests.

Me and my middle sister (19F) both are in trades, I’m a pipefitter/welding apprentice and she is a mechanic. The both of us have fought through everything she has thrown at us, and starting to become successful in both of our industries. When we both expressed interest in the trades my Dad was absolutely supportive and excited for us. But my mom on the other hand kept shaming us for it, “those jobs are unattractive for you both” “college is a better choice” “ this is not what I wanted for my daughters” 
Both me and my sister didn’t give in, she eventually realized we were a “lost cause” and finally gave up on trying to control us. Then after other people noticed how me and my sister were doing she gave in because everyone was impressed by the two of us going into male dominated industries. So she eventually started boasting about how she “raised two hard working daughters that kick ass”.

My youngest sister on the other hand (16f) is having difficulty shaking her off.. Mom buys her everything to hold above my youngest sister’s head, mom is involved with everything including my sister’s relationships giving her absolutely no privacy. This has caused my sister’s boyfriends to breakup, she has lost friends because of mom’s interference. And it’s not her protecting my sister. It’s her never leaving my sister alone, watching her every move, texting her friends and boyfriends. There is absolutely no privacy for my sister. It’s gotten to a point my sister has expressed that she’s lost herself. She has no clue what she actually wants because our mom has laid everything out for her and won’t give her any space to choose and grow as a person.

When fights break out my mother goes berserk when either me and my middle sister step in, or she manipulates my Dad when he tries to step in and defend us. She has manipulated my Dad making him feel awful for doing the right thing. Says things he won’t find anyone better, or threatens to leave him. My dad is the most amazing Dad ever. He’s always has been there us, he’s helped us through every breakup, every obstacle, attended every event for us in school. But as of lately with all of the fights with our mom he’s been depressed and lost. He has gave everything he could for my mom just to be treated so badly. They have been together for 24 years. And he’s never once heard her say thank you or seen her do anything for him. 

At this point I’m not even sure if family counseling will help. Suggesting therapy for my mom will end up in another fight because “she’s always right and we are wrong”. I hate to see my Dad broken, I hate to see the fighting. But I’m not sure what else we can do. Me and my sisters are lucky to have each other, we are lucky that our dad is our dad. But we wish our mom wasn’t the way she is. We don’t hate her, we just wish she could change. ",1,1,1747937490.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksxomo/family_falling_apart/
1kswy8a,"Aunt keeps saying it's weird, saying how people think I have special needs, and asking weird questions cuz I'm quiet",Decent-Tax-5730,"Hi, I am 15 and I used to be this very outgoing and loud talkative child up until 5 th grade. So I recently moved in with my aunt and cousins who keep yelling at me for not talking a lot and not joking around with them etc. yesterday I came from the doctor and had a good talk with my pediatrician who put me in counseling to help me to talk more and also for me and my mom to build a better relationship. So I told my aunt and she asked me to walk with her to the store which I did. She starts asking me if I was s@'d and if someone threatened me or something. She asks me if I think its weird that I used to talk a lot and all of a sudden I'm quiet. She also tells me how people ask her if I have high level autism or special needs. Then she tells me that I have a spirit that's keeping me silent and making me not want to be bothered by anyone. Yes I do get annoyed with her when she calls me repeatedly and nags me. She keeps repeating these things to me and thinks it's helping. It's putting me down and makes me not want to talk to her even more. She even told me (which isn't true) that ""oh when you walk like a penguin and are quiet and can't make eye contact with people your doctor probably thinks you're special needs and that's why she put you in counseling"". Yes I walk like a penguin it's this silly walk I do at times. She got upset with me earlier this year because I went through something at school and told a random girl instead of her. and also her daughter who is my cousin keeps telling me that I have a bad attitude and that I need to stop having an attitude with her and have a attitude with the mean people. But she literally always has a attitude with them and tells me how I'm weird and annoying her. I was passing over her while she was laying down on the floor but the cat was trying to scratch me snd I was trying to get it away from me. She says ""go  you're annoying me just pass over"". Like I wish they understood that people change like Is it that much of a crime to be a not talkative person? Why do they expect everyone to be the same loud person as them.

1kswbqh,What do you think about this?,Zzzzzzzlee,"Hello,
I live with my mother and father. My dad is sick and can’t work, and my mom works as a cleaner in a company she cleans offices, toilets, and so on. I used to work in a restaurant, and our financial situation was kind of okay because I was earning more than my mom.
But I realized something: all this time, what have I actually done? I worked for a whole year and couldn’t even save any money for myself. I don’t really know how to say this, but I’m tired. Every time I have money, my dad asks me to give it to him. And I mean, I don’t mind giving him money he’s my dad after all, and he’s sick but I started to notice something… the more I earn, the more he takes.
He even started asking me to ask my manager for early payments before payday. He always takes money in the middle of the month, and when I get paid, he takes from me again.
I’ve realized that I never buy anything for myself. I’ve never managed to save anything. I’m 21 and I’m a girl naturally, I need many things.
Even my mom goes through the same thing. He takes money from her all the time. And when she tells him she has no money, he says, “Go find someone to lend you some.”
But let’s say my mom does borrow money from someone who’s going to pay them back? Him? Where would he even get the money? Obviously, my mom ends up paying it back.
I know he’s my dad, but this is too much.
When we tell him we have no money, he tells us, “I’m sick. I need it.” It’s like he’s using his illness to manipulate us, to make us feel like we can’t say no. I’m sorry to say this behind his back, but I’ve seen him buy clothes and shoes for himself with the money we give him. Then when the money’s gone, he suddenly remembers he has no medicine?
You spent all the money on things for yourself, and only when it’s all gone you remember your medication?
My mom even works on her days off just to earn more money, and she ends up giving it all to him.
I feel so guilty. I don’t know how to stop this. My mom is exhausted. She works so hard for others and then gives it all to him.
I don’t know how to deal with him anymore. This has affected me deeply my mental and physical health.
He only cares about himself. He wants to be the center of attention. He acts like he’s the only one who ever gets sick.
When we’re unwell, he says, “You’re just pretending, there’s nothing wrong with you. I’m the one who’s really sick.” ",9,9,1747934256.0,https://i.redd.it/c7elxohy9d2f1.jpeg

1ksvsv1,17 and tired.,Personal-Scallion501,"I am a college kid of 17 years old, battling with severe autism everyday due to alot of stress and not being able to get rest.

I live with my mother, little sister (16) and little brother (14). It is stressful because i do not get the rest i need. Household is messy, loud. Little brother frequently has violent breakouts. Due to that i do not have a relationship with him, my mother hates me for it, everyday makes sure i know im a horrible human being for not giving him the attention he needs. Hes often violent towards me and gets away with it. Due to that i dont interact with him because it will have a greater chance of fighting.

Everyday, every chance my mother gets, she throws in the ""oh but your little brother puts so much effort; Hes trying his best; if only you gave him more love like he needs from his big brother"" Im tired. So tired. As the oldest im always taken so serious, yet hes 14! 14 years old. When i was that age i was told the EXACT same as i was now.

Im just mad. And misunderstood. I think i am what they call a scapegoat, my little brother is the baby and gets all the attention from mother, my little sister is the middle one, she doesnt want much attention and is just there. When i am tired there always HAS to be a reason im tired, my mother is always trying to insert herself into my feelings. Shes blaming everything i do because of my autism. She makes it an excuse, for her and for my little brother to continue being distructive. 

It just bothers me, why cant she treat me the same as my little brother? Am i so different? Or can i just handle everything on my own cuz oh, im almost 15,16,17,18. Ive always been told that, i havent had a chance to be a kid. I can always handle everything cuz im the oldest. 

When i cry and explain myself in a meltdown, because i am burnt out, she laughs at me, she mocks me. Never in a million years would she treat my little brother like that. Im mad. I understand as a person that its hard dealing with 3 kids as a single mom and a full time company owner. But as her son, as her kid. I am furious. 

I am just looking for anything. Anyone to talk to, my family therapists and therapists dont do anything. Im stuck, no money and i want to get out of my house. I am gonna burn out if i dont.

1ksvpci,What to tell an adult child,myazzitch,"My son’s 23. I’ve raised him by myself.  He saw his dad on and off for the first 8 years of his life. Very chaotic and volatile. 

A year ago he started asking questions about my relationship/coparenting  with his dad. And I told him some of what happened.  He’s now again asking questions.  He’s contacted his dad and confronted him with what I’ve told him. And what he remembers about that time. 

He’s hurt because his dad either denies or tells half truths. 

I want to say the right thing to my son. I warned him that his dad will deny it. 
That he’ll blame me or gaslight him. And that’s exactly what’s happening. 

His dad did awful things to me. And to my son. And others. Emotionally and physically.  There’s evidence of some of that from the court case. 

My son’s an adult man I know this. But it’s difficult to tell him even though he wants to know .

He’s telling everyone in his dad’s family. His dad had told the family that he was in touch with him but that wasn’t true obviously.  He’s not supported him . And now he has 3 children. 

It’s so heartbreaking to watch how angry and hurt he is but tries to hide it.  

What can I say and how can I be better to help and support him ? I listen and ask questions but I dong think this is enough.

1kssb8m,Do furry family count? Ralphies all I got and the only thing keeping me alive right now. Roughest time in my life.,thebiggerhurt,"
Please pray and send good vibes for me.
I am in such a bad place right now. My mental health is awful. I’ve had such crippling ocd and neuropathy and anxiety that I cannot function.



It all started about a year ago when I had a nervous breakdown and my mental health went south. Then I got diagnosed with neuropathy and cannot even leave the house.



I used to be a proud construction worker and able to do anything anyone else could but now my mental health is so bad most days I cannot even leave my house. I have horrible ruminating thoughts and anxiety and my legs burn like fire all the time.



I have been reading the book of Job a lot for some support and it helps but it just gets so hard sometimes. I miss my old life so bad I can’t stand it. I miss going to work and living like a normal human.



The worst part is that you look at other people who go on and live their lives regularly and you don’t understand how they do it when all you can do is lay in bed and cry. I just want to be normal again.



Sometimes I feel like I am cursed, but I know we serve a loving God and he will heal me in his time, I just wish he would hurry. 



I do have medical treatment but it hasn’t helped much at all I am just in a down part in my life. I am middle aged and I shouldn’t be like this I oughta be out working and enjoying life. 



Are there any other stories in the Bible of people overcoming strife?



I have no money and no food and am going to be evicted soon because I burned through my savings and lost my car. I have applied for social security disability but I still haven’t heard anything and applied for food stamps but that takes a while. 



I am so embarrassed to do this because I am a grown man and shouldn’t have to ask for help, but if anyone at all can help me with anything to get a meal or just anything I’d be forever grateful and I would for sure pay you back if I ever get my disability or get on my feet. My cashapp is @captainmidnight5 if you can send anything, anything at all will help. I also have venmo @captainmidnight5 I also have PayPal at the same username same one on all 3 PayPal would be easier for me tho. hate to ask and never dreamed id have to do this. 



I’m so embarrassed to do this and please pray for me. Above all I need prayers and good vibes. Please God help me. I get down and frustrated but I am reminded of Jon and he still didn’t curse the Lord and I won’t either.



I have no speakable family as I grew up in the system and have no one I can borrow off of and my credit is ruined because of me not being able to work. I was hauling scrap metal off to make ends meet but my truck tore up blown engine 2 days ago and it really wasn't even making ends meet just feeding me but now I have nothing this is awful and so embarrassing. I do have a full bag of dog food left tho I actually bought it with my last money just to make sure my boy eats. I'm hungry. I have 2 mountain dewd and a can of soup to eat then that's it and I'm putting that off until my stomach hurts.



Please just pray for me. I feel like Job. I know this will get better I just hope our great healing God hurries.

1kss7hq,My mom is Ruining my mental Health,ThrowRa-Pack-9803,"(I'm 21male). My mom and I live separately. She is abroad working, and I'm studying. Every time she calls me, I end up either angry or on the verge of crying. I know I have a hard time controlling my emotions, but she really knows how to push my buttons.

Let me give you an example. If I don’t pick up the phone for some reason (once I was in the bathroom), she will call everyone, even my neighbors, to try and break down the door. She tries to control every step I take. It didn’t bother me much before, but now it’s ruining my life.

I suffered from severe depression for two years. During that time, I wanted to go to therapy, and I asked her for financial help. She told me to just go outside and that I would be fine. But I was not fine. On my lowest days, I didn’t have the energy or will to clean my room or house. Once, she called me and made me turn the camera around to show the room. It wasn’t clean—there were cups and plates in the sink. She called me dirty and compared me to my father, even though she hates him.

Sometimes when I’m at home, I’m either doing homework, watching a movie, or just relaxing. She calls or texts and asks me to do something for her that isn’t urgent. She expects me to drop everything and do what she wants immediately.

I know she loves me, and she’s abroad because of me, but sometimes I wish she didn’t act this way. I’m so tired. My mental health is already fragile, and her constant nagging and pressure make me feel like I’m losing it.

1ksruuy,Worried about my niece,Th3greenCraze,"I had an awful childhood,  with parents who let life happen to them. They were so passive they could not even make simple decisions about life and the household. And more than anything else they were scared of judgment, I've always tried to call them out on how passive they were in life but they claim that everyone else is too active and everything is a waste of energy.
    Recently my niece has moved in with them, she's in the 7th grade. This morning my dad told me that neighborhood boys (one of whom is a relative) came to harass her, calling her all kinds of names and telling her to come outside. I asked what was done about it and he said nothing.  I then asked him if he was still going to give one of the neighborhood boys (the one we're related to) money . He said he would because the boys grandmother (his sister) was kind to him when she was alive. 
   I am pissed. These people have never stood up for me or my siblings because they are so scared of conflict with other people. I am scared for my nieces safety. Are my feelings valid or am I projecting my own feelings on the situation.

1ksonz6,MIL visiting new baby.,Low_Wing2219,"My husband and I (32M 28F) had our first baby in February. Life has been great and we receive a lot of help from my parents (they watch baby at our house twice a week). My whole family has met baby but unfortunately my husband’s family lives across the country.

My husband was showing signs of sadness due to them not meeting our baby yet. It pains me to see him upset (he thinks he hides it well) so I planned on getting his mother to come visit. His family doesn’t have much money so I paid for her plane ticket and decided to surprise him with her.

He was so happy and thanked me profusely for hours. That night he sat down with me and said “remember, my mom has a lot of strong opinions. I’m worried she might offend you while she’s here.” I assured him this is a happy time and I will keep my guard up.

For some context his mother and I get along because I’m a people pleaser and tend to shy away from confrontation. I will say if I met her on the street I probably would walk away from her. She is an overly negative person which I understand because I lived a few years of my life like that but it can be overwhelming at times. She has insulted my looks before immediately after I ran a marathon asking if I ever heard of a hairbrush and if I planned on putting makeup on. I also heard she calls me “Silver spoon”

It is day 2 of her 2 week stay. My husband went to work and I’m watching baby.
“You need to stop picking him up. You’re going to regret it.”
“Let him cry, he’s not going to die. Just put some music on to drown out the noise.”
“Stop picking him up all the time.”
“This baby is so spoiled.”
All day I listened to these comments but I held my tongue and kept tending to my baby. Keep in mind my baby doesn’t really cry. I pick him up before he gets to that point. At one point she was holding him and smushed his foot between a metal bar stool and her hip. He immediately started pain crying. I smiled and said “oh no, you’re alright little man” and took him from her.
“He’s fine! He doesn’t need you to help him all the time.”
He stopped crying and his foot was fine.
A while later she said “I can’t believe he smiles so much. He’s such a happy baby. Do you think something is wrong with him?”
I replied “he’s happy because we listen to his communication and tend to his needs”
She didn’t respond.

My mom came over to help watch him while I got some sleep.

And then it happened. I was getting ready for bed when I heard baby crying. I always check on him even if he’s in the care of someone else. It’s as if his crying is calling my name and it’s instinctual. I knew he was overtired and ready for a nap.

MIL was holding baby while my mom cleaned some bottles. I walk over to baby to grab him…

MIL: “NO!” She turns him away from me.
“He’s fine! Go to bed”

Me: “I can’t sle…

MIL: yells over me “GO TO BED.”

Me: “I physically can’t sleep if I hear him crying please give me my baby.”

She turns him away from me again and I had the urge to rip him away from her and snap. I wanted to scream to never withhold my own baby from me. But I held my tongue and explained calmly that he’s tired and I know how to get him to sleep in less than a minute.

I then grabbed baby while she gripped onto him tighter.

MIL: “LEAVE HIM ALONE. He doesn’t need you.”

My mom stepped in “give her the baby and watch how fast she can make him sleep, it’s so crazy! We need her to teach us.”

She reluctantly handed me baby and I got him to sleep in about a minute.

I laid him down and went upstairs. I didn’t tell my husband what happened but my mom came to check on me. I expressed how angry it made me and that it’s only for 2 weeks. My mom said “I’ll spend more time here the next two weeks to help out, I don’t trust her alone with him.”

So now I’m here. There’s more things I could add but this is already long. She told me all her children (including my husband) would tremble, rip their own hair out and scream for hours. She said she would hit them when they cried for too long and they would eventually stop. She also said she smoked her whole pregnancy and that they showed signs of withdrawal when born (tremors and excessive crying). My husband has talked about how they were raised and that he will never raise our children that way but he still loves his mom. 

I’m just lost. I was only looking at the positives when planning her visit but now that she’s here I can only see the negatives.

How do I make it through these next 2 weeks without snapping? How do I find the patience to handle the comments? Am I being overprotective?

Any advice welcome.

1ksnm6m,I think me and my husband are cursed,DragonsBoy,"I'm 22 (f) and my husband is a 24 (m). No, I don't actually think we're ""cursed"" but it feels like it. We got married April 26th and ever since we got married things have never gone right, only wrong. Not even two days after we got married, my sister got into a huge argument with me, my husband, and my mother. She was yelling at us and obviously me and my mother had no problem yelling back at her and because my husband simply raised his voice at my sister trying to defend me and my mother, and it wasn't anything offensive towards her, he just wanted us to stop fighting. At the moment he was holding our two year old son in his left arm, and all because he said something, my sister went for him and physically tried to assault him while he held our son. He grabbed her right wrist with his right hand and because there was a gate between them, she used her left arm to try and lift herself up on the gate and the metal on top of the gate dug into her arm, he never even touched her left arm because he was using his right hand to hold her right wrist and using his left arm to hold our son. Thankfully, she wasn't able to hit my husband or son but I did immediately yank her away from him and she turned on me and got me down on the ground before she started to punch me in the head while having a hold of my hair. I tried to get her off but she's a lot bigger than me, my mom tried to get her off of me but accidentally lost her flip flop in the process, when she got my sister off, my sister grabbed my mom's shoe that had fallen off and hit me with it in the face. My mom got us separated and she was told to leave immediately. The next day we did call the cops, my mom had told me not to the night before because she didn't want anymore problems but I told her the next day that she needed consequences for her actions because this wasn't the first time my sister has lashed out at a family member and physically attacked someone because she ""lost her temper"". And my son could've been hit because of her actions so that's the biggest reason I wanted to press charges and make a report. We called the cops, made the report and pressed charges. She was arrested that same evening. And don't worry, it gets worse.

After she got arrested, her boyfriend started texting my mom harassing her about how this was all her fault and she should've never let me call the cops, that because of her, my sister was having to sit in jail right now. And the very next day, my sister wasn't even in there for a full 24 hours, my grandmother bailed her out. My grandmother says she isn't ""taking sides"" but she's been nothing but supportive of my sister and her crazy ass boyfriend. I didn't drive anywhere the day after she got arrested but two days after she was arrested, I had to go to town to run some errands and my car wouldn't start. The engine wouldn't turn over but the battery life was still working, even when I could get my car to start for a few seconds, the engine would shake violently. I called my grandfather and he came over to look at my car because the same thing was happening with my husbands car, shaking engine and wouldn't hardly start. We noticed that when we took the gas caps off my car and my husbands that there was a dark brown liquid around the rim, there was an excessive amount. We immediately began to think that my sister's boyfriend did something because this was just too much of a coinsidence that BOTH of our cars stopped working at the same time and he had already lashed out at my mom, so he was clearly angry with us all for what we did. My grandfather tasted the liquid around the gas caps and low and behold, it was COCA COLA. I tasted it myself and I felt like I was going to explode because it tasted exactly like coke and our cars were having the exact symptoms if someone were to pour coke into our fuel tanks. And after my sister had been arrested, her boyfriend was the only person who had actually been alone that night and lived right down the road at my grandmother's house, all he had to do was walk through the patch of woods, through my neighbors yard and then he'd be at our house. My grandmother claims that he was at his aunts house the night my sister got arrested but he could easily be lying and can't show any proof that he was actually there. But also. Nobody knows what time he could've gotten there, he could've went over there for a little bit or went over there late a night after he was done tampering with our cars. Sadly, we don't have any cameras put up so we don't have any physical evidence to prove that it was him, my husband and I live with my mom, so her brand spanking new car was in the driveway, same as ours. And hers never got touched so we know it wasn't some teenager or else they would've hit all three cars. And nobody else in our neighborhood got touched, so who else could it be?? Of course, they're swearing up and down he didn't do it, but my sister is also claiming that my husband ""attacked"" her and tried to ""break"" her arm over the gate when he had a hold of her and that she had only been ""pointing"" at him. She had never tried to hit him even though we all witnessed her fist going up in the air like she was going to haymaker him. So I guess we were all just imagining things? Maybe she was pointing her fist up at the sky? But also, if my husband was the one attacking her, why would I not go after him? Why would I need to yank her off of him if he was the one doing the attacking? And if she was ""hurt"" and ""scared"" just as much as she acts like she was, why would her first response be to turn on me and start pummeling me and beating me with a freaking shoe?? I could've just been trying to help her! We all know she's full of it just like her boyfriend is. 

But because neither me or my husband have a working car because the coke has completely screwed up our cars, even after we tried putting Heet into the fuel tanks. It's been extremely stressful between us, his job has barely been giving him any hours so we barely have any income coming in, and I mean like not even 100$ a week kind of income. Since we got married we haven't had a single night or even day to ourselves, we never went on a honeymoon because we couldn't afford it and we were just gonna try and go later when we had more money. We've been fighting constantly it feels like, I feel like we make each other miserable and that he doesn't want to be with me because I'm hard to be around right now, same for him, it's been hard to deal with him because he doesn't have a stable job, we have three kids to take care of, he won't talk to me about his feelings. We just argue and argue. I don't think we've really had a single day since we got married where we didn't argue or get into it about something. And then on top of all of this, my ex, my two oldest sons biological father has been nothing but a dick and is threatening to get an attorney to get the kids from me, even though he's the literal definition of a deadbeat, the kids don't even know him really, he sees them maybe once a year and doesn't ever call them. He doesn't provide for them and he refuses to fill out any child support paperwork that the child support office sends him... so clearly he's talking out of his ass. But it's another stressful thing to add to the pile, I try to focus on the good like our wonderful adorable kids, but a lot of the time, I just want to cry and fall apart. I feel like me and my husband are going to get worse and our kids don't need to see us fighting, but they do, I'm afraid I'm losing my husband and our relationship is extremely strained right now. I don't know what to do, I try to be in a good mood for my kids and him but there's always something that gets to me and then ruins the day for me. I have major depression disorder and borderline personality disorder along with very bad anxiety. I've tried to research what I can do to do better but something ever seems to help. I've tried therapy in the past but they don't ever seem to listen or they tell me things that I already know. The last therapist said that I'm a chaos seeker and I told her that at times yes I can be because that's what I've grown up, it's been nothing but drama with me and my family or me and my ex and his family, at this point, I don't know anything but toxic relationships and cycles. I don't want that with my husband though, we've been together for four years and he truly has been the most supportive guy I've ever met, he's become a dad to my two oldest boys and we have a wonderful little boy together as well. I'm just scared that I'm going to lose them and don't really know what to do. ",1,0,1747910826.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksnm6m/i_think_me_and_my_husband_are_cursed/
1ksmjgy,AIO disappointed in future MIL,GypsyWoman1974,"I (42F) met the most wonderful guy (40M) and after almost 2 years, our wedding is this summer in Mexico. He has the nicest 19yo daughter and we get along great. He’s never been married and I’m divorced. 

We were having a house built, and his parents invited us to live with them to save money. That part went great. As a couple his parents are pleasant and made us feel welcome the entire time. We had almost an entire half of the house and only saw them in the kitchen unless we planned on a meal out. When we moved out they gave us $3000 to put towards our wedding. 

However, his family seems really cold. They treat his 19yo daughter well, but he says he’s always been the odd man out, he was supposedly a bad kid in high school but it was because they belonged to a strict church, and he wanted to be normal - wearing shorts, not having a ridiculous curfew, etc. His parents put his sisters through college but not him; he is a computer engineer and does well. 

His family frequently has get-togethers and they don’t invite us, or invite us at the last minute. His mom and sisters make all the decisions on family gatherings. 

I’ve talked to him about how they treat him, but he is laid back, used to being treated this way, and just would rather not see them as much as possible. But I thought I would be getting a new family when I married him, and it doesn’t seem like that is going to happen. 

The worst thing they did was at Christmas while we were still living with them. I mentioned to my future MIL that I would love to make Christmas cookies with her, and she agreed that’d be fun. But the next week we came home and she and her daughters were in matching Christmas sweatshirts making Christmas cookies together. I was able to act normal until we got to our room, but then I cried for hours. I’m a grownup but it hurt my feelings so much!  I felt like I was in high school again with the mean girls. 

I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong, since he says they’ve always been that way. Should I just give up on having a relationship with them?  ",7,4,1747906557.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksmjgy/aio_disappointed_in_future_mil/
1ksjkxa,am I wrong for being upset about 440 bucks being missing,PristineHistorian761,"I (16 female ) have lost 440 dollars from my savings. In context I have been saving up money in some organizer. I got my job when I was 15 and I been saving ever since. I had built up to 1500 dollars in my education fund and 1080 in my savings and around 600 for a new car. Earlier this week I had gotten my check and I cashed it as I usually do and put it in my selections. Yesterday I decided to count my money to check. I didn’t have enough . Maybe I got my total wrong I had my grandma go and count my money. I was missing 440 dollars. I began to panic. As a 16 year old 440 bucks is a big deal. I text my mom about how my money went missing. This where my sister comes in (24, female let call her Jackie). This isn’t the first time my money has gone missing in the past “my little brother “ had gotten into my money while Jackie was supposed to be watching him. 80 dollars went missing. We found 40 dollars later that day in the wash the rest never found. I began to cry that day and basically had a panic attack. And I was told I was being dramatic by my family. I was told it was my fault because I left it out. And to hide it. I hide it in a hidden place in my room but after a couple of months I stop hiding which caused this train wreck.Anyways back to the story. I ask my mom to talk to my siblings about my money. They both claim they don’t know where it is. I let it go and the next day/today I ask my mom how much exactly I was missing cause she wrote it done early that night. She says she doesn’t know. I I asked her to text me the total price and she says she is to busy. I asked her to do it when she not. And she like well I don’t know the exact amount that is missing and what would that even benefits me. I told her I just want to know the total and that it is imporant to me to know. Mother then said that probably some of the money is missing cause she swear I took money out when we went shopping.And I told her no I didn’t cause I got paid that day so why would I take out of savings cause that makes no sense .she like when maybe it was another day or something . In the meantime I am texting my dad explaining what is happening.  He told me he was sorry and to hide my money until either my mlm or he opens an account. My mom and dad are divorced. Later today I texted Mother this “Please found out how much exactl I am missing. This matter to me please tell me” 
She then replied to me “ Literally if you have your dad harassing me too “. I then tell her “ I am sorry. He is my dad I am allowed to tell him what is happening. I am not saying that he should harasse you but mom this is a lot of money and to acting like it not. Mom I dont think you understand how long it took me to save all of that money.”
She then tells me to leave her alone. I don’t know why but it hurt so much hearing my mom to leave her alone. But I told her okay then she gets mad at me. “ You literally have no idea what I’m acting like “ I told her that it was her actions toward me and she yells about how she is opening a bank and to just leave her alone. So I tell her okay and then she got upset cause I didn’t tell her I am sorry. I told her I am confuse on what she wants me to do. She told me this “ You basically said I didn’t care and I told you what I was doing and then you didn’t even say you’re sorry so yeah I am mad. You’re making me feel pretty shitty.”. Anyways later once I got home from school my mom acted like nothing happened. I do think my sister did take my money cause she has been struggling with money problems. But umm if you actually give me advice than you this is more of a vent more the anything.",1,0,1747893854.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksjkxa/am_i_wrong_for_being_upset_about_440_bucks_being/
1ksitt5,I feel like my family is tearing itself apart while I watch helplessly,thelightmaster7,"I love each and every member of my family beyond words. But I feel as if its falling apart around me. My mother ever since getting a second job (as in she works two jobs now and now works 12 hours in total) has not been the same, acting as if she doesn't care anymore saying she wants to go back to her home country with dad because she doesn't think there's a future for her here, and this new behavior has strained her relationship with my brother to where the two keep fighting again and again to where my brother tells me he has nothing but hate for her and that he wants her to move back to her home country so he doesn't have to see her anymore. 

  
Let me make it clear, I doubt any of us are innocent, I'm not as I failed to pass some certification exams after she tried to get me to study although I am retaking them, my brother keeps lying and doing things he's not supposed to (Likely due to him being a teenager), my mother's long work days likely making her snap easier saying some things she doesn't mean in arguments, meanwhile father I think is the most innocent of all of us, but I think its because I'm more concerned about my mother and brother's strained relationship and because I know dad loves mom. I keep trying to talk to them, but my brother won't budge and I feel like I'm talking to a wall with my mom. Brother doesn't want to go therapy so I am going to try getting my mom to go. But I feel like I am out of options and am stuck watching it all burn around me. 



Please if any of you here can help me fix this in any way, or even just say something kind to me in a comment, I will really appreciate it. ",1,2,1747890908.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksitt5/i_feel_like_my_family_is_tearing_itself_apart/
1kshbca,Just need to vent,Chance_Potato_333,"This is going to seem fairly minuscule so sorry for anyone with real problems, I’m just tired of the BS and need to vent. So long story short my entire family followed me in my cross country move. It hasn’t been too bad having them here (other than my mom but I won’t get too much into that), and my daughter loves having her cousin around. We’ve lived here about a year and a half, them only about 6 months. My friends that I made in that time were only work friends because if I wasn’t at work I was at home with my daughter, then pregnant, then with both kids. I have now left that job and as a lot of us know, work friends are work friends. So I’m back to square one with no where to go with two kids and no one to talk to. Turn to family right? Bit of back story there I have always been there for my family and tell them they can come over whenever, my daughters would love to see them. They never do. Well now, my niece that lives with them works nights and sleeps during the day. She’s a heavy sleeper and if we go over my kids are usually quiet. If they’re too loud and causing issues, we go home. Tomorrow is my nephews 5th grade graduation. So i thought to ask if we could come over after it was over (we are going to it but it’s not much of a chance to see him or anything) so that my daughter could see him and he could hang out and have fun on his graduation day instead of having to be alone. I was told no because it’s not fair that my niece (25f btw) has to sleep for work and can’t have fun too so we can only now come over when she’s off and can join in. What? But they have never once come over and hung out. The few times they’ve been to my house they either stay in their car outside or aren’t here longer than 30 minutes. I just don’t get it anymore. They’re supposed to be family but don’t ever want to see us, only when I go to their house with the kids. Oh and the off chance that I’d need something? It would just lead to them complaining and saying no. I don’t even ask because I know where that’s going to go 🙄. Sorry about the rant and if you made it this far kudos to you.

1kscecp,“I’m 28 and my 55-year-old mom has been financially dependent on me for nearly a decade — how do I break free?,madamedemontespan25,"Hi, I need help with a serious, ongoing issue.

Since 2016—nearly a decade—my mother has been financially dependent on me. After divorcing my father (which I helped fund at age 19), she moved in with me. Since then, she has not contributed to rent, bills, or household expenses, despite receiving $500 in monthly alimony and working briefly.

We lived together in cramped spaces where I covered everything. Even during the pandemic, she hosted a friend for their annual “vacation,” despite not contributing or working. When I moved back home in 2020 to recover financially, she stayed with relatives—again, without helping with expenses. Now, she’s back living with me as of September 2024, in a townhouse I can barely afford, even with my partner’s help. She still offers no support, claiming she has “a few cents” in her account, and has openly said she doesn’t want to work.

This is not due to depression—she exercises daily, vacations yearly, and spends most days on her phone or watching TV. I’m the one up at 3 a.m. hustling to make ends meet. She has no savings, no plan, and no willingness to change. The burden has robbed me of my 20s, independence, and financial stability. I feel trapped and worry I’ll never be able to have a life or family of my own.

My sister and I have tried to talk to her, but nothing gets through. We grew up with the bare minimum, and now we’re supporting someone who refuses to support herself. It’s exhausting, and I’m desperate for solutions—or even words that might finally make her understand.

1ksbrke,My SIL is ruining everything,SwimmingRich2949,"OK, I want to keep this short. It will be hard. But I will try. My sister-in-law  is a toxic person. Basically my father-in-law had very unexpected and very severe health issues. I think that messed my brother-in-law up pretty good. He messed up his college career. Had a weird relationship with alcohol. He started dating someone several years older than him who was a bartender. She got pregnant after six weeks. This is now my sister-in-law. I sound very judgmental. The reason that I do is because it all started badly. We had mutual friends that worked at the same bar as her and his friends advise us. We should ask for a DNA test. Nobody ever did. It’s not my place. This was almost 10 years ago, but things have gotten progressively worse. She got in a lot of trouble with the law before we knew her and my brother-in-law took a personal loan out so that she could get all those debts paid off and bought a car so that she could have his old car and start driving it. They got married because she needed health insurance.Then since bartending was her primary income and she was pregnant she quit because she didn’t want to be around cigarette smoke. But she kept smoking and drinking throughout her pregnancy. There have been so many ups and downs between her and I. She and various family members. I have no idea what their marriage is like. I know all of her complaints. She felt like a single parent because my brother-in-law had two jobs. But that was so she could stay at home and be home with the kids full-time. Yes, they did have a second one purposely. The difference is between the two are very apparent.

The reason this is bothering me now after close to a decade is because they made several terrible decisions that are impacting us. They decided to move two hours away in some show of independence. The problem is they’re not independent. My in-laws drive out there all the time. So what starts out as a simple errand turns into an all day ordeal because it’s a 4 Hour Dr. when you look at it round trip. That’s taking away from so much. My husband‘s grandparents are in their 90s and need a lot of help. My mother-in-law still works and has to take a lot of time off. My father-in-law gets tired very easily because of those health issues I’d mentioned. but they don’t care. My brother and sister-in-law don’t care and my in-laws don’t set any boundaries. I had a baby a year ago and we don’t assume there will be Support but I can tell you any support we would have had is no longer available because of the time and energy and money. It takes to make those four hour long trips. The other thing that came to head recently is that my sister-in-law decided she has substance problems and went to a rehab facility for about six weeks. I think it’s great that you should try and fight your demons. I do find it questionable that we all knew she had a dependency on alcohol, but it didn’t bother her until we had a baby and needed help and she thought her Support might be going out the window. there’s a lot of resentment all around. And it’s really driving me nuts. Now the house they bought two hours away they cannot afford. Instead of renting or moving closer to home they’re going to look for a smaller home in the same school district. My in-laws are cosigning. I need to set boundaries. I need to stop being bitter and resentful. I’ve never felt so full of hate before.And this is coming from someone who never met her father and his teenage mother abandoned her to let her grandparents raise her! I’ve worked my way through my demons in years of therapy. Half my life. I just cannot reconcile watching someone make mistakes in thinking that they’re smart enough to know they’re making mistakes while still making Them.",1,2,1747868408.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ksbrke/my_sil_is_ruining_everything/
1ks3vy2,My mom almost treats me like a criminal,Cold-Advertising-856,"My story with my mom

I’m 14, and my relationship with my mom has been rough, especially since April this year. She treats me like a criminal even though I’m just trying to live my life. Yeah, I vape, and I told her straight up how long and what I did. But she makes a huge deal out of it, constantly asking for every single detail and writing it all down on her phone like I did something terrible. It’s like I can’t even make my own choices without her controlling everything.

She says stuff like: “What are you gonna do, cause trouble, vape, get weed?” Like she doesn’t trust me at all. Meanwhile, I give her respect but get nothing back except accusations and negativity. She often talks badly about other people and seems emotionally unstable. One minute she’s nice, the next she might explode or start crying.

She emotionally leans on me without saying it out loud. I feel responsible for her feelings, but I just want to be left alone. She expects me to come to her with my problems, but I don’t even trust her. And when I try to talk, she twists things and makes it all about herself, like my feelings don’t matter.

Sometimes she says things that hurt, like I’d rather talk to my mentor than to her, and that she doesn’t even know if she wants me to go to Arnhem because I “make a mess” at home. It feels like I’m never good enough. And even though she says she wants things to be better, she talks to me more like a cop than a mom.

She was almost a single mom since I was born, so I get that it’s been hard for her. But I can’t keep taking this bullshit. I have anxiety about failing, feel guilty all the time, don’t dare talk back, and just want some respect and peace. This is not how a mother and son relationship is supposed to be.",2,2,1747848909.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ks3vy2/my_mom_almost_treats_me_like_a_criminal/
1ks2thn,My Cousins Drain Me but They’re the Only Family I Have Abroad,Decent-Water-7147,"I’m a 19-year-old woman, and I moved to a new country for school. Coincidentally, two of my cousins (who are 4 and 6 years older than me) also live in the same city. We didn’t plan this, but now they’re the only family I have here.

I usually spend holidays with them and their extended family. While we do have fun sometimes, I’ve noticed that I always leave our hangouts feeling drained. There’s always something during our time together that rubs me the wrong way. I’ve tried not to focus on the negative, but I can’t help it — and the weird thing is, I never feel this way with my friends. I genuinely enjoy being around my friends, but with my cousins, it’s different. I can’t spend long periods with them without feeling emotionally exhausted.

My dad encourages me to stay close to them since they’re the only relatives I have nearby, and I feel guilty pulling away because from their point of view, it might seem like I’m being ungrateful. They do try to take care of me sometimes — for example, paying for meals SOMETIMES since they’re older or including me in road trips when their parents visit — but still, something feels off.

I’ve been slowly distancing myself to avoid unnecessary drama, but I can’t cut ties completely because they are family, and I might need them in emergencies. That said, I’ve started to notice some passive-aggressive behavior from them on social media, which makes me think they’re sensing the distance.

There are a few things that really bother me about our dynamic:
	•	I can’t have meaningful or intellectual conversations with them — our interests are just too different.

	•	They dominate conversations and rarely ask about my life or how I’m doing and even when I talk about myself they don’t respond or seem interested and continue talking about themselves.

	•	They often make backhanded comments about my family and just always make everything seem like a competition and have low self esteem 

	•	I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around them. They’re quick to judge, easily aggravated, and sometimes gossip about other cousins.

	•	They lack the emotional intelligence and self-awareness I value in the people I surround myself with.

       •    I also don’t feel comfortable around knowing they probably also gossip about me since I’ve heard them before 

The most ideal solution would be to have an honest conversation with them, but I don’t feel close enough to them to do that without risking conflict or making things more awkward.

I care about them and wish them well, but I don’t know how to balance being polite and maintaining boundaries without seeming cold or ungrateful. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? How did you navigate it?


TL;DR:
In a different country for school and my cousins are the only family I have nearby. While they help me sometimes, I find them emotionally exhausting, judgmental, and self-centered. I feel guilty for pulling away, but being around them drains me. I’m stuck between keeping the peace and protecting my energy. Not sure how to navigate this without burning bridges.",2,0,1747846377.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ks2thn/my_cousins_drain_me_but_theyre_the_only_family_i/
1ks2p6m,Parents taken away all access to my devices and severely upset and trustbroken with me,Wide_Positive7101,"Hello. I have had this problem for like 2-3 months where I have: (I live with my parents now)

1. Been on chatbot for hours searching up real life scenarios like about therapists, adults in professional settings, how they would respond to certain bad or so-and-so scenarios. like often 4-10 hours a day occasionally, and those scenarios that I do, I haven't experienced in real life and get concerned about them and I often redo them because the scenarios about them I often want to do again and again until it gives me the result I expect or makes most sense, which it bothers me a lot when it doesn't and gives me lots of anxiety. Some scenarios are ""please provide scenario of college girl boasting agasint parent then apologizing for small mistake"", client choosing to not listen to therapist/workout instructor for..., few other scenarios of acting stupid with adults in professional settings
2. being on computer a lot leading to less stretching and less exercise, clearly less throughout the week and sometimes overholding urine and poop.
3. Staying up very late even in spring some days
4. Not going out to malls or stores almost not at all
5. Having thoughts overcloud or get into my mind of studies and stuff
6. Few days skipped one meal or even one snack
7. Slightly delayed college work
8. Not in statistics class for 3 weeks because of those concerns
9. No cooking at all
10. Avoiding lots of responsibilities

This stopped last week, but it is horrible and concerning. I have continued a little bit after that, and because it has continued, my parents have been really upset and trustbroken with me. Now my toxic and narcissistic mom is saying she won't buy me laptop at all until 1 year later and won't even allow me chatbot for doing work. My dad is getting very toxic towards me. There is ultra strained relationship because of this, and I am too scared because of their toxicity and abuse and firm ass mind to ask them for laptop unrestriction, where they will keep saying in a verbally attacking way that ""I hate being your jailer! This is fucking annoying!"" I am 22 years and 7 months old right now.  I am now getting ordered around for almost everything, and the environment is getting super intimidating. What the fuck do I do for this laptop shit? I now know that I can ask for books, or use quora or reddit to ask questions, instead of getting in endless loop to ask questions that concern me where chatgpt fucked me up. They are now disappointed and frustrated with me, with over tense conversations with me, for my mom being 24/7 right now. My parents will now no longer give me internet computer as of this, and they are over confrontational with me. What do I do now? My parents keep seeing me write scenarios of stuff like how supervisors would react to someone not listening, how people would react, and scenarios of parents vs someone younger. They are very hurt by the parent scenarios with trust gone down and down totally and them being hurt beyond imagination and blaming me for it. They keep calling me motherfucker, and they call me looking up stuff online as concerns about my parents as motherfucking, and wasting my life.

1ks1vx5,Is my father cheating on my mother? Help me figure out,scarlett_novaaa,"I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong, but I really believe I am. My siblings agree with me, and even people who know them are on my side. So for the past 20 days, my siblings and I noticed something strange on my father's phone.

There was a contact saved as Praveen Kumar on WhatsApp. At first, it didn’t seem suspicious. The profile picture was of a little girl, and the messages just said ""Sir, Sir, Sir."" Since my dad has a job where people respect him, I figured it was a colleague or client, so I ignored it.

But then something weird happened. I clicked on the chat, and just then, Praveen Kumar unsent a message and went offline immediately. It was strange. I thought maybe he got mad that my dad didn’t respond, so he unsent it out of frustration. Still, I brushed it off.

A few days later, one of my siblings came to me with more info about the same contact. Apparently, this Praveen Kumar had been chatting with my father a lot—tons of missed calls, flirty emojis (not just one or two, but several). My sibling even showed me proof. He deleted those chats my father

Then it got sketchier. This contact sent a picture of an SBI bank account that had the name Prameela on it. The person in the photo was clearly a woman. And that hit me—just like I used to save my boyfriend's name as ""Divya"" to hide the fact he was a guy, maybe my dad saved Prameela as Praveen Kumar to hide she’s a woman. He Even deleted right after sometime when he realized he forgot to delete. Unfortunately we saw those pictures and chats.

We confronted our dad. My mom asked him who this girl was. He said she was a friend of a friend who needed help with money or a recharge. That’s it. My mom believed him, but then he turned around and tried to manipulate the situation, saying we were just trying to ""distract"" them. He even made it seem like we were trying to cause problems between him and our mom.

But here's the thing we didn’t believe him. If it was so innocent, why was the contact saved under a fake name? Why were the call logs and chats being deleted? And why was she sending flirty emojis? If it was just a friend's friend or relative

We got smarter. We linked his WhatsApp to our devices so we could keep track. Then he blocked the contact and deleted it… but a few days later, we saw he saved the number again, this time under a new fake name: Raju.

He kept talking to her. We saw messages like ""Where are you?"" and she’d reply ""I'm at home."" They'd voice call each other, sometimes for minutes, sometimes for hours even while my dad was at work. They’d chat and delete the messages immediately afterward. She even sent him pictures  which he deleted before coming home. We haven't saw those pictures right after notification he deleted it.

I even found her Instagram from her phone number.

So yeah… is he really cheating? I believe he is.

It makes me angry, because my dad is a strict Muslim man. He barely prays, but he forces Islam on us forces us to wear hijab, follow rules. He treats us like we're the ones who should behave perfectly. But when I got caught once talking to my boyfriend, and my dad found out he was Hindu, my dad made a huge deal about how Muslims shouldn't talk to or marry Hindus. He told how hindu boys are haram and dangrous.

And now he’s literally talking to a Hindu woman, building a relationship outside of marriage, which isn't allowed in Islam either. He’s a hypocrite. He’s cheating on my mom, and he's doing exactly what he tells us not to do.

All I wanna know , is he actually cheating? Or is beyond that? ",1,0,1747844138.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ks1vx5/is_my_father_cheating_on_my_mother_help_me_figure/

1ks16zn,Im not sure what to do about the situation with my sister,Mean_Release_143,"This is a long post but, I feel like I need to share all of details to get advice on what to do in this current situation.

Ten years ago when I was twelve years old I was living in California with my mom, dad, brother and sister ( who I’ll call Olivia) and some of my extended family. During this time period, there was family drama between my mom and dad, because my dad was having an affair, and my parents decided to get a divorce. Before I lived in California my family and I lived in Rhode Island. During the summer my mom was planning on taking me and my two siblings back to Rhode Island, because she thought we would be happier there, since that's where I met all of my childhood friends, and we could escape all of the toxic family drama associated with my father. Olivia was about eighteen or nineteen during this time.

Before we moved though Olivia  ended up not coming back to Rhode Island, and instead ended up staying with my father. This is also because Olivia  met a guy who she was dating at the time, who I thought she wanted to stay with. When my mom and brother and I moved back to Rhode Island, we kept in touch with Olivia . We would text and call each other regularly, and when I was in seventh grade I remember she came to visit us during my winter break around christmas time, and she came to visit again during the summer, and the next summer after that, when I was about to go into high school. After the last time that she came to visit things became more distant between us. I remember the last time she came to visit my mom and Olivia  would get into arguments and not get along.

When I was in high school, things became more distant between Olivia  and the rest of our family. We would try and reach out to her, by calling and texting her, and it got to a point where I would only rarely hear back from her. The more time went on the less and less she would talk to us/ I would send her text messages and call her and she would rarely answer. My mom told me that one time it got to a point where my father felt like he had to call the police to check up on Olivia , and apparently during this time she said that she doesn't want anything to do with her family.  My aunt and my grandmother were also very concerned since Olivia  wasn't talking to them either and she's usually very close with them. One time  I remember when we talked on the phone I asked her why she won't talk to mom and why she's been so distant. She told me that she feels resentment towards my mother, because of stuff that she did to Olivia  in the past, but, when I tried to ask Olivia  what she was talking about she wouldn't tell me, and that it was just between her and my mother.

About six months ago, some things happened with Olivia  and her boyfriend who she was with for nine years, and eventually she ended up moving back to the east coast, to live with my mother and I. During the time that she's been living here, I've noticed that Olivia  seems different. When we saw each other six months ago when she came back it was the first time we had seen each other in seven years. Things were very awkward at first, and she seemed different. One time Olivia  and I had a talk, and she feels like we abandoned her. She also expressed this to my mother when she came back.

When we talked about this Olivia , said that my mother never asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island, with my mom, my brother, and I. Olivia  said that she talked about this with my mom, and my mom says that she did ask Olivia  if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us, but Olivia  insists that my mom was gaslighting her, and that she never asked her if she wanted to move back to Rhode Island. Olivia  basically thinks that we just decided to move to Rhode Island. I also talked to my mom about this, and my mom says that she asked Olivia  if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us, and according to my mom Olivia  said that she didn't want to come because she didn't like Rhode Island. Olivia  said that us moving to Rhode Island happened so suddenly, which I don't remember, because I knew that we were moving back to Rhode Island during that year, before the summer started, and I knew that she must have known something about way before then, since me and my family members were all talking about it.

I remember when we talked about this that Olivia  also admitted that when she came to visit when I was in middle school that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back and live with us, and Olivia  said that she felt like this was manipulation, so she turned the offer down. I just don't understand Olivia 's logic behind this. So she wished that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island, and then when my mom finally asks her to come move in, was it somehow manipulation? My mother also doesn't see how we abandoned her, because when I was in high school she says that we did nothing but keep in touch with Olivia , and that we even sent her gifts during the pandemic, and we let her come visit during the times I mentioned previously. My mom doesn't see how we abandoned her, when she feels like we did nothing to keep Olivia  in our lives, while we were apart.

What really bugged me during my and Olivia 's conversation, is that when I told her that I tried to text and call her while we were apart, she said that she ""doesn't care about a call or a text"" and that she wanted to see me. I feel like that's unfair because I don't see how she expects me to make plans to see her if she just decided to disappear and not respond to messages. How else did she want me to communicate with her when we were across the country from each other.  I feel like that's also unfair of her to say that, because I was twelve years old when all of that happened, and I was a literal child too, so I feel like I didn't really have much of a say in the matter. My choices were to either go with my mom, or to stay with my dad, who was literally cheating on my mom at the time, and was a toxic person to be around. The way I see it I didn't really have much of a choice. I just feel like the distance between our relationship isn't my fault given the circumstances at the time.

Lately since Olivia  has been back, I am always feeling like there is tension in the house. Olivia  just comes and goes and barely speaks to anybody and just goes off to our room by herself and rarely comes out. I've been home from college recently, and she's hardly said anything to me. Yesterday, my mom and Olivia  got into a heated argument because my mom, who has been dealing with this everyday since Olivia  got back. What happened was my mom was trying to have a conversation with her about why she barely talks to anybody, and what’s going on with her, and Olivia  just blatantly walked away from her while my mother was talking to her. My mom lost her patience and went into our room to confront Olivia  and they both got into a heated argument.

Today I mentioned to my mom about how Olivia  and I were having a conversation and she said that she tried to call me back multiple times while I was away at college this semester and that I didn't call her back. I told her that I was busy with school and I was also really busy with making a short film that I wrote and directed. She then said ""Well you tried to call mom while you were gone, so that excuse isn't going to work."" When I mentioned this to my mom, my mom was upset about that, because she felt like Olivia  was bullying me and that her behavior was manipulative. I said that by her tone of voice, that it sounded like Olivia  said this in jest, but, my mom said that you don't need to have a certain tone, and that Olivia  was trying to make me feel like I did something wrong even though I didn't, and that I really don't owe here an explanation. My sister is staying with us right now, and in two months she’s leaving to go to boot camp for the army. 

I'm just not sure what to feel about this and I am not sure what to do about this whole situation. 

TL;DR: Olivia  has been distant between us, and she recently moved back from California to live with me and my mother. There has been tension between her and my mother, and the rest of us. I am not sure how to feel about this or what to do.",1,0,1747842482.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ks16zn/im_not_sure_what_to_do_about_the_situation_with/

This happened this morning between 4-5am. 
I know my spouse got drunk last night. I’m wondering if he went and bought hard liquor I know he was drinking beer. Any way 4am this morning, his alarm is going off and I nudge him a few times to turn it off. He gets up to go to the bathroom, when he’s done, he leaves the light on and door wide open. Comes back to bed. ( we have a 3 yr old and 2 yr old that sleep in our room next to our bed. It’s just more comforting for them) I ask him to close the door so the light doesn’t wake up the girls. He doesn’t answer so I asked if he heard me or if he’s ignoring me, he gets up, mocks me, then mumbles ‘go fuck yourself’. Ok fine, I didn’t say anything back. I just thought to myself there’s absolutely no way I will help out someone who is going to talk to me in such a way. I’m not getting up and getting his lunch or coffee ready if he will be disrespectful to me. So then about 40 minutes later im trying to wake him up so he won’t be late for work. He gets a little snappy with me after I tell him what time it is. He goes out to the kitchen, I guess to see if there’s a lunch made. There isn’t. So he starts slamming things, banging coffee cups around in a drawer, slamming the refrigerator door. He comes back into our bedroom looking for something and I ask why he’s slamming stuff around at 5 in the morning. He says he’s going to starve today. I told him there’s a whole container of food in the fridge. He says he doesn’t have time for that and he’ll just starve. I repeated myself again about the food in the fridge and he tells me again to ‘go fuck myself’. I told him as he was walking out the door he’s acting like a fucking child. And that was it. I’m pissed because my girls were in the same room as all this was happening, whether they heard it or not I always told myself I wouldn’t be in a relationship like this. And here I am. Tolerating some bullshit man child temper tantrums. I’m the one that always has to try to fix things. It will be turned back around on me somehow. There is hardly ever an apology from him. I don’t know anymore. I’m just lost, defeated, exhausted. ",2,2,1747832042.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1krx3he/i_just_feel_sad_sick_to_my_stomach_full_of_anxiety/

The 3 of them never and i mean never clean up after themselves but create a massive mess to results in basically the whole house needing to be cleaned. My mom has tried everything under the sun to try and get to clean up after themselves but nothing works, from calm two sided conversations to shouting to ultimatums you clean your room and you'll get your phone back. They keep saying ""but its boring"" ""i dont wanna do that"" or say that they will do it but they only do it that day for the next hour and later on continue with their shit. 

Im seriously done with it, im doing my leaving cert therefore staying at home to study more but because of that mom asks me to make dinner and sometimes if needed do shopping but for me to cook the dinner i need to clean up their massive mess in the kitchen cause putting the cereal bowl in the dishwasher is so much harder than putting it in the sink. Because of the mess it takes me an extra 40 to over an hour to sort it all out and i end up loosing time on what i gave myself extra time for, study. Hell its not even about that just the fact that they WONT CLEAN AFTER THEMSELVES. 

Idk what to do my mom doesnt know what to do, it causes her to cry from frustration but my siblings just dont care. My moms frustration also then causes arguments with my father him defending my siblings when shes giving out to them cause they wont clean after themselves. Its awful living in a place like this everyday along with other family troubles. I just dont understand why they wouldn't clean after themselves?

How could i approach them to make them realise that they need to take some responsibility for themselves and literally just clean after their own self?
I have tried before but nothing. Im at a loss.

1krt5x9,Coming out.,EZEANGELLE,"Hello, my name is Ezekiel, and last night, I came out to my parents as a non-binary, macs-presenting individual. 

I was nervous at first, but to be honest, I had pretty high hopes! 

At first, it seemed as if my parents were actually listening to me. They let me speak and didn't talk over me. Great, right? Yeah, it didn't stay that way for long. After awhile, they eventually dropped their understanding act and started to shove religion down my throat. My father told me “I’m not religious, but I stand by God.” and showed me a video one why being apart of the LGBTQIA+ community was a crime. I was crying while watching itt because I genuinely couldn't imagine myself being a daughter and my father asked me “Why are you crying? Why does this hurt you?”

My mother would occasionally let out a bitter chuckle, or a sarcastic laugh saying: “It’s so sad! My daughter wants to be a son.” That hurt the most.

After the conversation, I remember going to my dad and saying sorry for bringing the conversation up, since it had probably upset him. He just hugged me and said:

“It’s okay, Anak. I’m sorry you have to feel this way, I know no one wants to feel the way you do. Just fight it, you'll accept that you are a woman one day.”

I don't know how to feel…. It hurts so much. Am I in the wrong? Should I just do what they say? Is it really my fault for feeling this way? Should I just abandon my identity for their sakes? I don't know anymore.

Anyways, I’m really sorry that my first post has to be a whiny one 😭😭😭

Don't get me wrong, my dad has never hit me, my sister, or my mom, but during arguments he has tendencies to start to throw things around the room like a child. It genuinely upsets me. He recognizes that he has anger issues, and he even went to couples therapy with my mom, but it just feels like he keeps getting angry over nothing.

I (21f) think my aunt (40) and uncle (42) have no remorse for the actions they took against my sister (26). My uncle (let's call him james) reposted a hurtful post on Facebook against the Trans community. My sister (let's call her Emma) called him out in his comment section when my uncle replied to another commenter that seemed to be upset by my uncle's original post. The comment said ""I've never pushed my belief onto you I'd just hoped you would respects me"" my uncle replied to that comment saying something along the lines of  ""I know and I have. I just mean the people who claim to have xxyy123 chromosomes""  in other words my uncle only thinks people with xx and xy chromosomes exist. My sister Emma responded to my uncles comment saying ""so this mindset applies to your niece"" meaning my younger sister who has turners syndrome which means her chromosomes are xo and not fitting my uncles ""norm"". My uncle and sister then had a long text chain of comments trying to prove eachother wrong. My aunt (lets call her sarah) then texted my sister a long ass text along the lines of ""how dare you call your sister trans"", "" if you are struggling with your sexuality are you gonna cheat on your husband?"" and the big kicker ""Lastly thank you for supporting my ex husband who was abusive and cheated on me with another man and put a gun up to my head"". I find it interesting that my aunt sarah thinks my sister would ever support an abusive asshole just because emma believes that everyone has the right to love who they want regardless. Its clear my aunt sarah has not been to enough therapy if any at all. My uncle posted about 150 hurtful posts against people who have mental issues, people who are liberals, people in the LGBT community and more all within the month of April 2025. Then my aunt and uncle decide to post passive aggressive posts on facebook against my sister and roped the rest of the family into basically hating and making fun of my sister and her husband since my brother in law decided to stick up for his wife. (All of this mind you my sister had struggled with depression since she was 16 and if she wasnt in a good place right now she could have ended her life because of the constant hurt they were doing towards her). My brohter in law called my uncle an idiot for supporting RFK and the things he said about autism because my uncle had an autistic kid and cant see the possible harm of the registry.  My brother in law said ""your and idiot"" instead of using the correct you're which made my uncle laugh at him for his grammar when my uncle misspells indeed (he thinks its two words) as well as misuses the ""theres"" all the time. Just a hypocrit. My dad then calls my uncle because they are brothers and tries to get my uncle to understand what he did was wrong by, asking If this situation had happened to his own children, how would he have felt. My uncle respoded with ""if my kids came out as any part of the LGBT they would be kicked out of the house."" My dad also said the reason my aunt sarah broke her arm was because of karma. That comment most likely got back to my aunt from my uncle because after my dad hung up of his brother my aunt completely blocked me and the rest of my siblings on Facebook when her beef is with Emma and my dad. To this day my uncle still is posting shit like that and the only person we talk to on my dad's side of the family now is my dad's other brother who is being Switzerland right now. My family doesn't blame my other uncle because we wouldn't want him to lose his family for something he didn't do.  Ask any questions and I'll try and answer them as best as I can.

1krmikl,I am starting to HATE my niece. Help!!,Proof_Fly_8948,"Yall.... so I think I am going to put my niece out to go back and live with her somewhat homeless mom. I have literally been with this child since she was born and helping and buying things the whole time she has been alive. She has for the most part lived in a place with me minus a few times her mom got her own place(another story). But, my niece has been living with my mom and I while she attends college. We were trying to be supportive so that paying rent and bills would not be on her plate and she could just go to college. Upon moving in I had her agree to ""STAY"" out of my room and my bathroom because she has a history of taking things and lying about it. Long story short she agreed because she did not want to go with her moms living arrangements. She is a sneaky, lying, ungrateful person my niece is. She goes in my bathroom pumps all my shampoo, sneak and use my body wash but that's not the part that sends me. I really like neat clean things so sometimes she would in the bathroom and leave shit in the toilet and recently left a fucking used pad on the sink. Then...when you ask her about it it's ALWAYS not her. She steals my clothing then try to sneak it back and we DONT wear the same size in tops at all. God gave her the biggest racks ever and I can literally still wear kids shirts. Long story short is that after 19 years of her antics because when she was younger she did similar shit to me. She keyed my TV, stole my earrings, tore up my shoes. And as a 18 year old she gave my crocs to her freaking friends, gave my Stanley cup as a loaner to her friend without asking, mind you I bought her one. I am tired it is at the point I shoot my self to get away from her and this family or I put her out. I am asking God to help me because I am just filled with hate for her and I am tired. I am sick of it all. I am a Scorpio soo...there is that... what should I do? Leave it to God? Put her out?

1krkq3f,"Treating great nieces as surrogate grandchildren, makes me feel less important",ChaosRoseXV,"I (36F) am an only child, I'm in a committed 10 year relationship and my partner and I are fully decided to be child-free for a plethora of personal capability reasons. I have nine cousins through both my mother and father's sides, all of whom but one have children.

I hope I can explain this correctly. I can make edits and clarifications if something doesn't make sense.

I don't have this situation as much with the cousins on my father's side, since they live much further way. However, whenever there's a baby on my mother's side my mom becomes deeply enamored with the baby and ends up talking to that particular cousin a lot for a while. But it was always ""there's a new baby. There's a new member of the family"" excitement and was never really extreme and seemed pretty normal to expect of a woman who really loves children. But this time feels so different.

My oldest cousin on my mother's side has never had children of his own (I'm not sure if he and his wife can't or what that situation is, I never felt it my business.) So they found themselves in a good place for it and decided to register to be foster parents with full intention to foster to adopt. They were expecting to probably help an older child, but fate had other plans for them. Basically the same day they were approved as fosters, they got a call about a pair of twin girls that had just been born that needed a foster family. They are now officially adopted at this point. I'm so happy for them.

The girls are almost two now and basically since the first days they were home my parents have been helping my cousin out with the girls. Staying overnight, babysitting, even just visiting, etc. Now my cousin's parents (the actual grandparents) live closer to them and are actively in the girls' lives as well and they adore the girls. So there's no absence or anything there. I'm not against them helping. I'm happy that they seem happy to do this sort of thing for family.

Where I start to feel bothered is when I have my mother's phone basically shoved in my face no matter what I'm doing, busy or not, to be shown the latest pictures or video of the girls. Or I have no choice but to be regaled with the latest stories of the girls. It just feels like she sees the twins as the grandchildren she'll never have and dotes on them as such and I feel that things going on in my life matter less and less since I'm not married and able to give her grandchildren.

She's not a bad mother at all, she's just shy of oblivious in understanding how her actions make other people (mostly me) feel. She's never been someone I could easily confide in. There isn't a lot that she and I have in common to connect with. So I'm just feeling like I'm less important in her life now that she has my cousin and the twins to dote all over.",2,1,1747787444.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1krkq3f/treating_great_nieces_as_surrogate_grandchildren/

1krhm62,How can I contact my elderly helpless mother,SoftSpecific6213,"I live in Europe with my wife and child.  My elderly mother lives in the USA with my step father (he is in a coma and is in hospice care at home) and with my volatile brother.  My mother is 82 and speaks very limited English, cannot operate a phone and she is cognitively diminished.  My brother is 42yrs old and has not had a job since he was 18 and has always lived with them.  He basically just plays video games and lives like a hermit at home.  Since his father, my stepfather had a catastrophic auto accident, I have been dependent on him for contact with our mother.  He had blocked me on WhatsApp or half a year and now my wife as well.  I now don’t seem to have any way to contact my mother.  I am not sure what I can do.. I know that he is not treating our mother well.  I don’t think he is physically abusive but definitely verbally and is neglectful.  Do I need to go to USA and do what?  Also I am afraid of the possibility of a physical altercation that has the possibility of escalating to lethal.. he has a handgun and my mother told me he had brandished during one of his tantrums.  I cannot move back to America and take care of my mother and I am not sure about the viability of bringing her to Europe, due to both the long flight and her demolished cognition.

1kra59t,"My uncle (age 53) still lives with my Grandma (age 77) and is abusive, and some reassurance would be appreciated",Pearl_the_Princess,"My uncle still lives with my grandma some of the things that upset me are: 

.  He yells at her when she doesn’t hear something, 

.  He makes her cook for him when he can do it himself (she has COPD which is breathing issues)

.  He doesn’t help her with bills 

.  He’s had the police called on him my a neighbour for yelling at her (they could hear through the walls) and he’s spent a night in prison. And my grandma still thinks he’s the victim and justifies it.

.  (This one might sound odd) my grandma tells me he likes going out doing things, but as soon as I come over and stay he doesn’t want to go out and just stays in the house.

.  The few times we have gone out. He gets angry when me or my grandma want to look at something we want to look at and storms off and yells that we’ve been taking too long when it’s literally been two seconds


I know some of those things might sound petty on my part but it’s upsetting for me. You might think “I should talk to him about it” but trust me he’s not the type you can have a conversation with. You could say hello and he wouldn’t say a word or you could ask a question and he’d straight up ignore you. 

My grandma justifies everything he does when the few times I’ve criticised his behaviour and she says “he has a different way of doing things” she doesn’t condemn him at all. And the whole situation makes me feel like crap. 

My grandma asked my mother (age 56) some years back to help her sort her will out, and she refused to tell my mother what’s in her will despite asking her for help. Me and my mother are worried about when my grandma passed away she’s going to give my uncle all her money and give my mother, me (age 20) and my sister (age 17) nothing, I know that might sound horrible, I don’t want my grandma gone. It’s just the future that scares me. 

I’d like some advice or reassurance. It would be greatly appreciated. I’m feeling extremely down, hopeless, angry and frustrated. Thank you if you read this :))

1kr8cl0,"I don't know what to feel about this, can I express negative emotions towards my mom sometimes?",chezenutss-45,"     Well here's my situation, my mother doesn't really like it when I frown or get mad, especially towards her. Now I did it again; she saw me frowning so she literally told me not to frown and she was totally mad at me. Although I admit I sometimes frown bcuz of her, but this situation was different. It was not even about her, and she just suddenly told me she doesn't like it when I frown.
 
     Here's the thing, I already noticed this but I don't think me and my mom has that strong emotional connection. Like yeah we casually joke and make fun of each other, but I do feel like that's it. When it comes to personal deep talks or anything about our own personal life I don't quite feel our bond. There's like a wall between us. Yes I can still tell her my problems, but only those that are trivial unlike problems about school issues, social life and more..If I ever had the guts to tell her, it usually takes a lot of time and courage for me to actually tell her. I sometimes tell her after it was alr solved cuz I feel like she will just get mad at me right at the moment.

    That's another thing. I don't really show my true emotions or feelings to her, like I'm hiding a lot from her (well I know she's also hiding a lot from me too but I don't wanna go there since its a dif topic) I feel like I can't be honest with my feelings and thoughts when it comes to her. I feel like she just expect me to be happy all the times. If I get mad, she also gets mad at me. Like is it my fault that I was feeling that emotion? 

     So I literally searched it up what's that and I feel like it is sort of an invalidation of my feelings. I rlly want to confront her, but I don't have the courage. I feel guilty easily, and I admit I sometimes hurt her, but we rlly can't even say sorry to each other. I do want to way sorry to her but it just doesn't go the way I want. Like somethings stuck inside my throat. We only ignore the fact that we just hurt each other and call it a day. Like nothing happened. 

     This situation rlly got big, but no one's even confronting the other. Just silent treatment as always. But today, I rlly want to confront her, it's just that here in our country's culture, parents are always right. So talking back to your parents mean you're rebelling, even though they R not always right. I want to get out of this. I don't want this continue.

I do not live near close relatives, but I invited my youngest , older brother and my grandad. The day of my graduation things did not go as planned , brother didn’t respect my wishes and brung a stranger to my home and my grandad wasn’t being useful and disrespectful as usual. The whole point, I asked them and stressed so much that I did not want my mom or her husband at my graduation. There was a situation months ago where she was causing drama, and spreading lies about me to the point I had to clear my name with a polygraph test. I decided that day forward I did not want anything to do with her. The day of my graduation, she ended up coming with her husband and kids. I was upset and did not even want to walk anymore. I couldn’t enjoy myself at my own celebration. Plus, my gut feeling kept bothering me and pestering me to just leave. But I didn’t and stayed until the end. When we were done at the graduation, we went to a nice restaurant afterwards. Ofc, they complained about the food , embarrassing me. But after , my grandad had to come back to my house to get his belongings to go back home with my mom and her husband. As I was coming towards the car, my mom kept acting like she was going to send me money, asking me for my Zelle information, and email/phone number. I told her I would have to text it to her. I ended up forgetting about and needed to get some things fixed on my car like a week later. I remembered she said she’ll send me money, so I asked her. Photos: 

She’s been saying how her husband has a mechanic that can put my brakes on there for me. They’ll purchase the parts and stuff. She stated over a week again that the parts they ordered will be here on May 19th. Called her first yesterday asking her if they arrived , and her response was “they will be here sometime this week.” Texted me early in the morning saying bring whatever parts I need. Me being confused I asked “the parts came yet? When?” She then responded that if I wanted to take my car to the dealership , go ahead and do so. I blocked her. I am tired of going through this thing where they are acting like they are going to help me, but never fall through. Constantly being let down is why I am struggling to do daily tasks, and to succeed in life. How do u get rid of them for good? I am tired of the drama, going back and forth, and contents put down and let downs. It’s not helping me , it’s destroying me. ",5,5,1747754909.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kr7qki
1kr7hsl,Father took it too far! What to do?,Ok-Dust7843,"I 19 f, have 2 other sibling in abroad and I live with my father mother and cousin(12). I had mentally and physically effecting incidents that caused great toll on me. I was suicidal and I am still. I think about ending every week atleast one time. Usually my parents fought on random things just like other parents would about kids, money, smoking (father smoker) etc. My mother learned bakery cuz it was free on a event even though sometimes father made faces but when he tasted those foods from her classes he would praise it. My mother used to help my father in shop before but she is now housewife for more than 3 years. So she doesnot like sitting on home doing nothing so she would try to Bury herself in any work. And today she told about how that classes has ended and she could even work under that as my father was unhappy but said that as she said was depressed from sitting in home doing nothing she could do anything. 

But, he drank and said something that my mom is crying words and tears are stuck. I can't even process it. My father accused my mother of cheating while drinking. He said alots of things that I could see that first time in my mom something broke she tried denying but he kept on cursing and accusing. I couldnot defend nor I could talk I was having dinner. Foods were stuck on my mouth. While washing dishes I cried but tried my best not to break down. When I entered room and saw my mom lying in bed with lights closed sniffling I cried on bathroom. I can't comfort her nor that I can say something that could make her stop thinking about it. I was hanging on thread cuz my parents who loved me my friends and bbf there for me but now nothing. Those suicidal thoughts are hunting me again. 

I am too tired physically too I had labs and such mentally I am thinking of ending.  No one knows I am paranoid, scared of dark and see things that doesnot exist in dark, talk to my self alot I mean alot. If I can't share it at all not even my BFF.

1kr77ei,My sister stopped talking to me over a decade ago,omnipotentfemaleJC,"Hello, my sister stopped talking to me over a decade ago. She told my parents that I punched her in the face and that’s why she doesn’t talk to me, the problem is, it literally didn’t happen. She is just embarrassed that she is such a bad older sister so she needed to make up a reason. When she first started doing this, I used to cry and beg at her door step, asking her why she’s so cruel to me for no reason. I think the truth is, is that she never wanted me to be born, because that’s how she treats me and that’s how she acts. I was born only 1 1/2 years after her, so I “stole her childhood away”, She may not even fully understand that is how she feels, but it’s just obvious by the way she treats me. I didn’t hit her, I never talked badly about her. I’ve only cried and begged for her to talk to me but I stopped doing that at least five years ago now because it hurt too much to be rejected every single time. She simply doesn’t love me. She makes up excuses, but there really isn’t a legitimate reason. She tried to sleep with all of my boyfriends, she took her clothes off in front of my ex boyfriends, she has run around the entire town shit talking me to people that used to be my friend but ended up using and abusing me. So, this is reality. I have come a long way, I have coped with it. I’m just puzzled she has allowed an entire decade to pass without even saying Hello, even after my children were born. She’s not an aunt. She only saw them once because she was forced to at an important family event. My parents are absolutely useless. They haven’t been able to resolve it either.

(all names are fictitious for privacy)
i live with my mom (40) and my older brother alex (20). the three of us have been together since i was about 8. one day dad just went out to get bread and never came back.
he left because of alex. not just because he was a ""difficult child"", it pains me to write this, but he really didn't know how to be a father to him. when alex was 9, he was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder. this is when a person can suddenly flare up for no reason. he would scream, break things, punch the wall, and then five minutes later be back to normal. it didn't happen every day, but when it did, it was scary.
mom took him to doctors, consultants, psychologists. she cried a lot then. and dad just... distanced himself. he pretended that everything was fine and didn't notice mom's condition, which was getting worse and worse. they were constantly arguing, dad would sometimes leave for the night, and come back drunk. one such evening, there was a big fight between my parents, after which dad packed his things and left (it's so unusual to write dad, because he was practically not present in my life) he never wrote or called me.
after that, mom changed. she stopped being just a mom. she became everything to alex: his support, nurse, psychotherapist, and protected him like he was a faberge egg. she said that she should be the one who ""will never betray"".
but now... i don't know.
she was always too caring, but lately it's strange. as if I don't exist at all. she calls him ""honey"", touches his face like he's still little. sometimes she just looks at him for too long.
i'm not saying anything happened. not yet. maybe it won't. maybe I'm just making it up.
but inside i feel like there's a stone. i feel anxious. and i've started noticing more and more little things that make my skin crawl.

if anything else happens, i'll write. i just needed to say it.",1,1,1747747364.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kr4r6k/i_suspect_my_mother_and_brother/

1kr17tn,need to vent and maybe some advice,gembaby___24,"i've been dealing with a lot of family stress, my mom puts a lot onto me & i take care of my little brother and shes become more & more mean and expects so much from me. my friend & boyfriend literally compared me to cinderella. i am an adult, but im full time in school & actually had to quit my job in order to be in school and help her out. she went back to school to get her BA in business & ever since i told her i was enrolling in school she thought it was a joke. for starters im 24, i got a late start on life due to mental health issues & i got my esthetician license around 2 years ago & decided i wanted to become a registered nurse. she seems to always compare me to her literally all the time & it’s really frustrating for me bc i am not her & never will be(& don’t wanna be) 

I always help where i can ive been doing so much for my siblings since i was 15, she used to hand write me notes everyday in order to take my 2 brothers, sister & cousin ti school( now i do realize that this was illegal i only had my permit) but the extent of what i do now is, wake my younger brother up for school, make sure he’s fed, teeth brushed hair brushed, make sure he takes his medication, lunch made, drive him to school & his friend (she signed me up for carpooling without asking me just telling me) pick him up, feed him when he gets home, do hw with him, remind her he needs to take a shower, i used to have to literally wash his hair for him but he’s a bit older now & does it himself for some privacy, take him to appointments & sport practices and games, i cook for the whole family (2 younger brothers one 19, one 13 mom & stepdad) around 2-3 times a week (i also have a gluten allergy so more often than not i have to cook for myself after as well) do the dishes that are actually so disgusting, nobody in my house knows how to clean up after themselves they leave literal trash soaking in the sink & other stuff too. our agreement was i do this in exchange for rent, but i feel like after all these years me finally wanting to do something more with my life & going back to school she could cut me some slack, i pay for all of my own stuff & gas and don’t ask her for anything. she also owes me over $500, she used my credit card to book a hotel room for us when we went to visit grandparents in 2024 and still has not paid me back. 

i also rarely ever say i cant do something but the other day she wanted me to pick my other brother up from the airport when i took him a few days prior, i was in the car for a total of 4 hours, used my own car w my own gas that i pay for, i had a really long 10 pg paper due the same day & i told her i couldn’t do it, for weeks i had been telling her this. she went behind my back & told my brother i was going to pick him up anyways & when i confronted her about it she told me to not procrastinate and get my work done it’s not that hard. when i was trying to have an adult conversation w her about how it’s too much i need the day to work on my hw she laughed in my face & thought it was funny?? ultimately i didn’t do it & she’s still mad at me for that. we used to be really close but now she is just a miserable person to be around & is always in a bad mood or saying mean shit.

one thing that hurts me the most is we were getting ready for her graduation, my brother that i take care of we have a 12 year age gap & i love him to death, but he’s at an age now where he kind of notices that im the only one who takes care of him. he made a comment abt why does he have to go, she’s not even my mom, she didn’t go to any of my baseball games, she never helps with my homework or makes me dinner, dr appointments, and so on. it literally broke me because i never even really thought about that. she’s just completely checked out with him & like i said im willing to help wherever i can but i feel like he is my responsibility & i didn’t sign up to have kids yet, i want to focus on myself & get my life on track.

im planning on working full time during summer to save up to move out, whenever i try to have this conversation with her so she can prepare its a disaster. she thinks that i owe her something for taking care of me all of these years, mind u she’s literally my mother.. like ur supposed to take care of your kids. there’s way more things that happen on a daily basis but this post is already too long. just some ranting and rambling bc it’s been eating at me a lot lately and im always exhausted 24/7. if anyone has any advice let me know, thank you ",2,1,1747735808.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kr17tn/need_to_vent_and_maybe_some_advice/

She said ""We're not gonna be showing up"" And I texted her Saying, were you just gonna wait for me to look into the audience and see you, weren't there? I texted her saying I can't believe we chose a f****** PDF over your own daughter i told her she could let me know before I am and she didn't i called her selfish and told her he doesn't need stupid money to live on.

I asked her when have I called the only time i've called was to call my grandpa hmm, that day my Godfather message, my mom singing is disgusting how she basically disowned her own daughter and chose a PDF over her own daughter.Then how he finds it disgusting that she did. And how she is making me feel s***** for not forgiving him for being a PDF towards me and tryingto grape me, and she told me that the message I sent her yesterday was inappropriate and was a form of harassment. I didn't send that message to her. And that was the first time my Godfather ever texted my mom she told me I need to stop. I said, fine. I will be coming up there to get my things and my Birth Certificate. She told me she will be calling the cops on us if we show up to get my things.

Here is the message my Godfather sent to my mom.  Ive stayed out of all this bs between yall
and Hailey despite how shitty yall have been to her and how you have basically disowned your own daughter, but yall are wrong for ghosting Hailey on her graduation. The least you could do is show up. This is your own daughter for God sake. God has a very special place in hell for people like yall. What your doing is disgusting and honestly based off what I've seen from You these past few months really shows how shitty of a person you really are and how unfit you are to be a good mother. I really do feel sorry for Mia, Gia and Trevor. It's bad enough you keep them around a man that has no problem making sexual advances on a girl he raised as his own, but your also feeding them with bullshit lies and keeping them from there own siblings just becouse your afraid of the truth. You may have them fooled, but after tonight, your whole family that actually showed up to Haileys graduation will know the real truth......

1kqzef6,Struggling With a Physical Altercation,walgreens567,"A while back I was in a physical altercation with my stepfather. It’s something that’s been replaying in my head constantly, and I’m having a really hard time processing it.

Physically, there were moments he got the upper hand he ended up on top of me for maybe 10 seconds, then shoved me across the floor and walked away. I wasn’t seriously hurt, but I did get a small bruise near my eye. I managed to land one solid punch earlier in the fight that definitely caught him off guard, but I didn’t follow up with more, and I’ve been stuck with regret about not doing more. My goal at the time wasn’t to really hurt him, I wanted to get away

Emotionally, I feel like I failed because I didn’t win in a more obvious way. But part of me knows that not escalating further, and standing up to him at all was already something important.

I feel ashamed, angry, and disappointed in myself. It’s like no matter how many people tell me I held my own or did well, my mind keeps telling me I lost or that I didn’t do enough. There’s a constant sense of unfinished business, and I hate how small and powerless it makes me feel. I keep wondering if I should have hit back harder, gotten up faster, or done something more decisive. It’s exhausting.

How do you come to terms with a fight like this where you didn’t lose badly, but also didn’t feel like you dominated? How do you know what parts really mattered? 

Fortunately he is out of my life snd we don’t talk at all. There is a lot more to this situation but this is the gist of it.",1,0,1747728031.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kqzef6/struggling_with_a_physical_altercation/

1kqpibz,Am i wrong for hating my dad? / how do i get over my anger,iizzyy101,"Am i wrong for hating my dad? / how do i get over my anger 

Hello Female here, my parents migrated to the Uk and i was born a few years later, ever since i was born my dad has never really been in my life. He doesn’t like the life in the uk and chooses to spend more time in our home country rather than with his family. We never had a great relationship, Arguing - fighting never respecting eachother. Fast forward to when i was 14 my mum got pregnant with my sister N, my dad would visit us once a year Christmas time then we’d see him next is when we’d travel to our home country to see him (summer). Since my dad never liked the Uk he kept finding himself more and more responsibilities in our home country eg, he became mayor, started training to become a firefighter, stared building our “family” home, so i became the baby sitter. i baby sat my little sister since i was in year 9 - year 14 (extra year in college) till my mum was made redundant from her job. No matter my pleading he would never come back to help us even when i turned 17 and was desperate to find a job i couldn’t because i would find myself babysitting every week different days each week. When i turned 18 i started learning to drive   i found this very hard and emotional, my mum helped me pay for my first car for all the help with the babysitting — i thought since i have this car my parents would be more keen to help me learn to drive, no, dad never took me out to learn when he would come for a month in the christmas season he picked me up in my car many times but never let me drive it or take me out to learn, even after seeing me come back home in tears from driving lessons instead when his mum (my grandma) called to ask about me and ask how the license was coming along he replied “she’s too dumb for a license” i still wrote him this to this very day and he never replies and stays quiet. He never calls to ask how’s everything, didn’t call me to congratulate me on finishing college, on getting a job promotion and whenever my mum would point the phone onto me when he’s calling he always makes a rude “joke” or comment which gets my annoyed to then replying “yu can’t take you joke”

How do i get over my anger after pleading myself over and over to my parents and always getting a “but we’re family we’ve got to help eachother” reply. 

I want to have a good relationship with my father but my anger is stopping me i can never see him positively. 

What do i do?

1kqo50l,How do I tell my Bio Father that I want to go no contact,SpecificAd1011,"Hey Reddit! I 29F need some advice. Basically I don’t have much of a relationship with my bio father and I want to cut him off completely. 

A lil back story for yall; my parents divorced when I was about 11. My father wasn’t home often. He would be either out with his friends or at his moms (my grandma) or cheating on my mom with some random woman. Crazy thing is that the cheating was just the cherry on top of the cake that was leading to divorce. There were a lot of different reasons for the divorce but I’ll leave it at that. 

The only somewhat consistent time I had seen my father was when we (my lil sister and I) had to visit him every other weekend cuz he was required to do so in the divorce agreement. And even then there was a chance that he would cancel. 

When I was 14 he signed away his rights from us and that was that. We would still visit him from time to time and when I was in college I lived closer to him and would visit for a free meal and to visit my grandma (he lived with his mom until about 5 years ago). 

Today, I only talk to him a handful of times a year and he is always expecting to act like we have the perfect daughter/father relationship during the holidays. It is currently end of May and I haven’t heard from him since Xmas. My lil
Sister has told me that she and her finance will no longer go to the holiday parties in December. And I want to do the same. But I know I’m going to have to be the one to tell him. 

So Reddit, how can I tell him? How do you cut someone off completely from your life? 

Thanks!

1kqn98a,Feel guilty for sharing my sister related trauma with my mom,Frooms27,"My sis is 6 years older than me. I’m currently 32 and have had two children within the last year.

My sister had always been a terrible influence on me and introduced me to heavy drug and alcohol use. She put me in some real shitty situations and I  ended up being molested at 18 by her current husband. I decided to not tell anyone out of fear and disbelief and continued to drink and do drugs, basically a party animal.

Although I was crazy I still got my shit together and turned out okay. My hubby pulled me away from my toxic sister and now that I’m sober and have children I have reflected on all the shitty things my sis put me through. I ended up telling my parents and sister about the sexual assault(s) and put some strong boundaries between my family and my sisters.

I since have further explained to my mom how my sister put me in really bad situations and exposed me to fucked up things at such a young age. (Drugs, alcohol, drinking and driving etc)

My mom feels so guilty and blames herself for most of it. My parents both worked a ton and weren’t home or involved much. I kind of word vomited all the bad things she’s done, but I really just needed my mom to see clearly why my husband can’t stand my sister and why we put up such strong boundaries with her.

It just sucks so I feel like I’ve made her really upset and she’s really struggling with guilt.

1kqmyfg,Overbearing Mom - Guilt trip ! She wants to join every vacation,Future-Reveal5842,"I love my mom  we are very closely but she quickly turns overbearing and expects too much. 
I have a husband and a 6 year old daughter. We are all close and I understand my mom is lonely even though she has my dad. She does not work, and her other son lives in another state with 3 kids of his own. 
That being said, she volunteers at my school (I am a teacher) almost every day, and we see each other some days after and on weekends. 
We see each other on holidays. 
I made the mistake a few times of spending my summer break as a teacher with her and my dad. It always ends in arguing, or feeling suffocated. Last summer my husband and I were planning on doing an Italy trip , well she caught on and got my brother involved to guilt trip us to go altogether as her birthday trip since she always wanted to go. Well, I did it to make her happy for two weeks. It was a nightmare…
After that my husband and I said no more trips on summer with her. We need our time as our own family (me him and daughter) together.
(She also lives about 5 min away from us)
She and my dad tried dropping hints recently like “ we miss trips, can we do an rv trip again” and we say “we have plans already “. We are going on a cruise (which she tried to invite herself and I said no) and also its the first summer my husband is able to take a lot of  time off with me- we are planning a road trip.

Her birthday a few days away from mine is coming up. So I asked what does she want to do, that we are down to going out for the day. 
She never replied.
Today she came to volunteer in my classroom- well I asked so what do you want to do for your birthday? BIG MISTAKE

She said “ I am shy to say.” 
Eventually she told me “ I want to go on a family trip this summer for a week”
I said “ Oh but i have plans already I cant this time . Every summer we do a trip and this summer I need to spend time with my husband and daughter”

She burst into tears saying “ So I cant go on any trips with you this summer, not even a week” 

Ugh - i feel so guilty. But I need time with my own family for once. 

I suggested she could go on a trip or visit my brother with his 3 kids and said “its not the same” 

So idk, she kept crying, I did not feel like justifying my feeling because I know in her mind I am being selfish . 

What do you guys think? Any advice to approach this?",1,0,1747688137.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kqmyfg/overbearing_mom_guilt_trip_she_wants_to_join/
1kqgjj1,Go on the vacation w/o my husband,Ok-Organization-231,"Hello everyone, I need some unbiased advice. Before my husband (40m) and I (34f) became serious, we both made some mistakes. However, being a woman from the Caribbean, I feel like I’m judged more harshly. We've been married for three years now and, for the most part, we are happy together. There haven't been any issues on my end or his, to my knowledge. I try to be a good housewife; I don’t go out often because he gets jealous, and I prefer to avoid arguments by listening to him.

The problem is that my family is planning a reunion on a six-day cruise, and he initially agreed to go and pay his share. He has a green card, no criminal background, but he is terrified to leave the country and now says that my kids and I can’t go. I might be in the wrong because I paid the remaining balance for the cruise, even though he later said no, since the deposit was non-refundable. I was hoping he would change his mind, as I would be losing $1,000—something he wasn’t willing to pay back.

Now, I've paid the full cost of the cruise, which is $3,000, and he hasn't changed his mind about going. The trip is in 50 days, and I'm really eager to go. We spent the weekend with my cousins, and my male cousins advised me not to go, saying it would ruin my marriage. Meanwhile, my female cousins think it’s unfair for me not to attend since I’ll be surrounded by family. What do you all think? My husband has added that if I go, I can't complain if he decides to take a vacation by himself.",1,1,1747673211.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kqgjj1/go_on_the_vacation_wo_my_husband/
1kqfu14,My brother and I used to be best friends — now he won’t talk to me because of my husband. What do I do?,alyssa505o4,"
Growing up, my younger brother and I were super close…best friends, really. We leaned on each other a lot, especially since we had a semi-narcissistic mother and an enabling father. We understood each other in a way no one else did. But everything changed three years ago when I started dating my now-husband.

Backstory: My brother got into some trouble in high school — got mixed up with a bad crowd, experimented with hard drugs, and even ran away for a week to a party house. Despite all that, he always kept in touch with me. He even encouraged me to move in with my then-boyfriend. But then, one of his friends (who had literally just been at our house) got arrested for stabbing someone while high on coke. He was 18 and went to jail for it. 

Naturally, my boyfriend was concerned and told me to be cautious around my brother’s friends. When my brother later asked what my boyfriend thought about his “homie getting locked up,” and I relayed that he told me to be careful, my brother blew up saying that it meant my boyfriend didn’t trust him to protect me. Honestly, I just chalked it up to him being an immature 18 year old who would get over it. 

BUT since then, it’s like he’s disowned me. In the last three years, except for when I text him to say I love him, he’s only actually talked to me twice: once to come by when my husband was out so I could help with a job application, and once to defend our mom in a ridiculous argument where she was mad I texted “love you” instead of “I love you.” My parents and I have had several big fights but we always end up okay… my brother had never defended her to me before though.  

What really hurt is how he talks badly about my husband to family, all based on that one cautionary comment from years ago. I honestly thought our relationship might improve around the time of the wedding. When I texted to ask if he would come, I got a oddly formal reply that he would come with his girlfriend. Honestly felt like she was texting me, not him (I used to tutor him. I know he doesn’t write like that).

And then… he just didn’t show up. On my wedding day. Turns out he was moving out of my parents’ house that day, and my dad even left our reception early to help him.

I am so upset. It’s been three years! I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know how to move forward. I miss my brother, but I’m tired of being hurt by his silence and passive-aggressiveness. Is there a way to rebuild this, or should I accept that he’s choosing to stay distant? Any advice is welcome.

I have a 9 year business with my partner that we built together from scratch when we were courting, which is now our main source of income and it can’t be operated by one person.

I am looking into getting counseling for her treatment from her to both me and my Husband.

We went on a family trip over the weekend and she proceeded to yell at me saying the following things;

I was miserable 
I hate my husband’s kids
I am jealous 
My husband could get anyone he wants
I treat him like he’s five
He’s going to leave because I don’t trust him

I support us both financially and emotionally.
She wouldn’t be seeing him if it wasn’t for me
She has been getting worse and worse and I have never been anything but respectful towards her.

I told my husband if you continue to feed these odd things to your mother and you don’t stand up for me, we are over.

I am extremely depressed, I have absolutely zero self esteem, and all I ever try to do is help all.

I know I need to focus on myself

Above are texts she sent because I said good morning to her and she ignored me over the weekend and I got this flood of text messages.

I did not give her any fuel, nor did I respond or engage with this abuse.

There are so many layers to the dysfunction.

I am just looking for feedback and input. It’s bad I am aware. 

I am still processing this and it’s caused me tremendous mental anguish.

I love my husband, but she is toxic and ruining our relationship. 

Anyone that’s dealt with this I would appreciate how you responded or didn’t.

1kq2cvk,My older half sister secretly takes pictures and videos of me and my gf to send them to people??,Scary_Building_6078,"Disclaimer!! i know this is long scroll to TLDR to skip backstory!! My older half sister is 33 and still lives with our parents. Me 20 (F) still also live with my parents. However she’s 33 with a full time job and my parents (by this i mean 100% my mom) don’t ask her to pay a DIME (no rent, no bills, NOTHING). The only thing she does is work. I am a full time student in nursing school with 2 part time jobs. I have busted my ass to get scholarships and get loan forgiveness through my school in return to work for them after graduation. All because I never wanted my parents to stress about adding another bill like my school tuition. I’ve been a full time college student straight out of high school and they have never had to pay a penny for my tuition. And yet she says she has no money and is broke all the time to my parents and us. My mom has even given her money when she says she is going out with her now ex boyfriend. That makes me incredibly angry, she takes advantage of my mom’s pitty for her and shields her from the rest of us who see things how they are.

Now this is not the only reason I heavily dislike my older sister (just because i don’t want to use hate but now i think i do) for a lot of reasons, I met her when i was 8 when she came from mexico after my grandma passed who she lived with and at first it was great and so cool to have an older sister. that soon faded like very quickly. She would just straight up bully me and try to discipline me when my parents weren’t home and she was supposed to watch me like hit me and slap me when they weren’t home and not in a playful way. I never said anything because i didn’t want to cause problems and i was just a quiet shy kid all around. At the time we had a family friend who lived in an extra room and he witnessed her slap me and was the one who alerted my parents. When confronted she got out of it saying she just wanted to go back to Mexico because she wasn’t welcomed here. In which my mom just begged her to stay.

Since then she’s always been bitter and purposely doing things to me in which i grew to really not speak to her or interact with her i’ve only really stuck up for myself a few times when she was being out loud and direct but most of the time she just does things to get a reaction out of me. My mom always complains how she hates that we don’t get along and says I just don’t like her. We’ve talked plenty of times and her response is “you just have to understand she was raised by my mom and i think she just wants to be more like you and the life you had , remember her dad never spoke to her and it’s just a lot” in which I always say im not going to going to feel pitty for her and excuse her behavior because of it. My mom hates it because she says we only have each other here and she doesn’t know what will happen when she dies.

On a separate occasion she has told my younger sister (full sister 13) when speaking about me that she resents me because my mom left her and came to a different country when she was 12 and then got pregnant with me. Now it’s not like I had the best childhood ever in fact it was far from good because my parents worked day and night and i spent most of my time with a babysitter who would discipline kids physically. As well as having to immediately kill my childhood when my mom left for her (took her 7 months to come back) because my little sister was 1 year old and my dad couldn’t handle us both so I learned how to take care of her from showering, changing diapers, feeding everything while we weren’t with our babysitter. But they worked so much because my mom would send so much money to my grandma for her. She was put on a pedestal by my grandma and spoiled so i’m confused at how she resents me when i didn’t do anything but just live i guess.

****Here’s where my absolute hatred begins, I’ve been gay for a long time since I was in middle school and she never really said anything about it. I’ve been dating my gf for over 2 years and everything was fine she just said hi or casual conversation. Theres been some recent incidents where she had taken her keys and gone out in someone else’s car and block in my gf to where she couldn’t leave and her excuse being “i thought she was spending the night” (she left at 8pm with her car keys even though she wasn’t taking her car and my gf only spends the night on holidays where she will drink something) so that was just bizarre weird behavior. On top of other petty incidents we like to think she’s just weird and jealous. for example I like hello kitty i have a lot do hello kitty things and my gf buys me a lot of hello kitty things for the last few years my hello kitty collection has grown and then a few months ago out of no where she added a hello kitty bumper sticker to her car and some to her bare stanley. i thought oh okay weird but whatever. she’s been on and off with a man for about 2 years and he genuinely does not like her it’s very obvious but that’s a different story. Last week she claims they broke up indefinitely this time so she apparently has way too much time on her hands.

TLDR ********She doesn’t go out with any friends or anything of the sorts and i can see why but yesterday we were invited to a wedding in which my mom told me to bring my gf. my younger sister who also doesn’t really like her because of her weird activity and me and her are very close. Before leaving my mom says oh we’re gonna need 2 cars because we won’t all fit I just said okay i’ll drive my car and drive us. Since i’m not close enough my older sister says “ooh alicia’s (my gf) just gonna drive herself” in which i’m like um no she’s not i just said i’m driving us. she didn’t say anything and just walked to the car. My little sister saw my irritation and got in the car with me and my gf everything was fine after until it wasn’t. At the party i sat on the same side of the table as her but with a empty chair in between, my gf, sister and i just being dumb and bored were making random jokes about nothing in particular and just laughing nothing very sneaky or suspicious just talking. I think nothing of this, me and my gf get up to throw our food plates away and see if we want any dessert. on our way back to our table i notice her taking a video of us not very secretly playing it off like she’s on her phone I thought maybe I was just paranoid or something when i go to sit and i glance and she’s just sitting on facebook and puts her phone down. I continue doing my thing about 15 minutes later i notice her trying to turn her phone screen while texting which makes me think she doesn’t want me to see so i just look away until i catch something that looks familiar out of the corner of my eye. She’s on whatsapp texting someone and sending pictures of me and my gf standing and talking followed by a video of us walking towards the table. I play closer attention and she opens her gallery to attach more and more pictures of us pop up. I’m trying to get a better look but am too far to see what she’s saying I can only see a few chat logs in response with laughing emojis and text. I immediately am filled with rage and i look over to my gf to tell her she’s like “weird bitch oh my god what’s her problem” my little sister notices my face and asks what happened my gf tells her and she looks confused and mostly in disbelief. i tell her to come sit next to me to get a better look so she comes and sits in between us i play it off saying the light is in her eye when she moves because my mom asks. Older sister is still oblivious and continues to text. my little sister then text me I can’t understand what she’s saying because it’s in spanish (she’s not a great spanish reader) but it says something about being gay. This just makes it worse and in the moment i want to grab her and drag her outside. My gf tried to calm me down and i can just feel my body heat raising so i try to calm down because i know she’s not worth it. i text my dad (who also dislikes her because of how she acts and my mom babying her) and tell him she took pics and vids of us and is sending them to someone . he tells me to tell my mom so i text her as well (we’re all at the same table) im very visibly angry and upset i watch her read it and got upset a few minutes later she tells her go outside with her. I begin to talk to them about it when they leave including my dad and he just agrees with me. I’m very angry and i think she’s genuinely a bitter, ugly jealous person and needs to pick a struggle. I start making jokes about how if she really wanted a picture of us that bad she could’ve just asked us and we could’ve posed or done something else, just to calm me down from knocking her teeth out outside. About 7 minutes go by and they come back and there chatting like normal I spend the rest of the night not looking at her or ignoring her which was already what i was doing but I know this will be talked about when my mom realizes i won’t be speaking to her anymore under any circumstances.

I had my sister by my side so we both knew at the same time. We looked for details and found out who he was. Never told anyone. They both were from same working place, had calls for meeting and so on. She also made me talk to him occasionally, but as someone from workplace. Me and my sisters eyes used to meet when his calls used to come. And recently about an year ago, I saw a picture of my mom and the same guy in her cellphone. And very recently, about 2/3 days, my dad came home late from office party. My mom asked about the black mark, he had on his body. I think he didn't respond anything. Now, I really don't like when parents involve their children in these matters. Sort it out yourself. She called me to other room and talked about it being a bite. She seemed off. 

  
But, wtf. She is also cheating and he might be too. The reaction was like she has always been loyal. I hate how they are making me feel. I am not able to see my dad as before and about mom, its been so long I don't even care.  I hate this. I hope they talk and get a divorce or whatever. Just wanted to share this here, didn't tell my sister about my dad.

  
And it was a love marriage since they were 17 years old. LOL.",1,0,1747625416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kq22b9/my_parents_are_cheating_on_each_other_only_i_know/

I’m Muslim my dad Muslim my whole family Muslims. I hate to say it but I have , I can’t handle this anymore. I’m the oldest girl. I don’t have someone bigger than me to talk with. No one can’t believe me or listen to me. I have so emotions right now. I can’t forgive him. I can’t look to his eyes every time I see him. our relationship not the perfect but it’s hard to figure out that your dad cheated on your mom. My mom is the kindest woman ever. She do the best for her family and my dad just cheated when I was seven years old. I figure out that my dad have a password and his phone and that was so new to me so I open it and see a lot of pictures with women’s with him so I run to my mum and tell her from that day she never slept with him at the same room. I feel bad because my mum didn’t deserve to know that shit but I was a kid. I don’t know what to do. I just go to my hero my mum and now I am older when I figure out that he cheated. I didn’t tell her that’s kills me. I don’t want her to live with someone with like him. She deserve the best. He deserve to be nothing he didn’t deserve to to have a good family me and my siblings and my mom I don’t know what to do to deserve that. I swear I didn’t do nothing bad in my life. I’m just a kid with a broken heart all I have as some messages in TikTok app that’s all the things I have. I don’t have any pictures cause I was little when I see them .

1kq0z5s,ranting/need advice about brother ;;,risottoneero,"my brother’s a minor diagnosed w/ bpd. maybe i’m seeing this from a different perspective, since i’m not diagnosed with any issues like him.. but he has frequent breakdowns, some violent, and i wanted to rant about this. he often thinks the world is against him, he takes everything out on everyone else in the family and blames everything on us as well.
today, it was my sisters graduation and he wasnt allowed to go because whenever he goes somewhere with everyone,, he tends to have breakdowns and manages to make it about himself all the time.. and obviously it’s a big day so nobody wanted that. i stayed home since i didn’t wanna bring the mood down cause i honestly just listen to music & stay quiet (i might have personal problems too cause i get a bit upset when people try to talk to me in public TT not the point though!!!!) anyway, my brother was home too and i heard him yell a couple times and heard some noises in my moms room. i went out to feed my dog and i saw a few things scattered on the living room floor + an armrest that i thought was my moms chairs (it wasnt) but i assumed he did something in my moms room, assumption was right LOL.. he knocked down a lot of stuff in my moms room and was blasting music in his room. sorry for the off topic but he’s completely unhygenic and does not clean his room.. tbh my mom has catered to him his whole life and she still cleans it because it gets so bad. okay back on topic, i told my mom and she came home an hour or two later since it still was my sisters graduation & they went shopping. my mom and brother were arguing a bit ago & i think his reasoning was because he doesn’t have friends and can’t go anywhere? something about being a mistake too LMAO. he’s online schooled because he can’t control his tongue in public, he has no friends because he f*cks his friends gfs, and he’s a mistake because he can’t do anything for himself. he’s CAPABLE to get a job. he can drive too. but he refuses!!!!! sorry needed to clock that. if we’re completely honest hes just an ASSHOLE. first encounter with the police, he asked my sister to take a pic of him in the cop car, got put into the mental hospital maybe 3 times? he may have been kind the few weeks after but it did not last long. he boasts about wanting reassurance, my mom tries to give it to him, he cant accept it? ‘don’t act like you care’ he says.. he gets EVERYTHING HE WANTS if he throws a tantrum. he gives my mom so much stress and i just feel horrible, no one else really has breakdowns like this so she obviously has no experience with dealing with this? gosh he thinks everyone can do everything for him. the pointless arguments end in him slamming his door, screaming ‘you don’t understand me’ and blasts music.
about the physical breakdown, theres multiple. but the most recent one was with my sister.
it starts out with him being on the phone with his ex, screaming and begging to take him back or something (how low can you go???) and he was so loud my mom cut off his line and so he banged on my sisters door telling her to call mom to turn it back on. she said no, obviously, and he kept on banging. she opened the door and he was screaming at her more, only repeating ‘call mom’ and she was screaming to get tf out duhh.
anyway, he broke a bowl that was on her dresser and she says that he tried to swing (but i didnt see and sadly i doubt that LOL sorry sis) also i didnt see because i was in my room cause i had just woke up to this sh*t.. anyway well he spits on her and stuff, she punches him and he holds her down on her bed… i heard her yell ‘get off of me’ so i jumped out of bed lmao and started slapping his back and he eventually got off. my mom turned his line back on and he backed off and started begging his ex again.
my mom & dad did nothing about this. atleast i don’t recall. he laughed about it. Psychopath, literally. 
lets see.. another breakdown with him.
maybe two three years ago? i had a heart problem and was going to get surgery a little soon. it was late at night and he was knocking on my door asking for my vr headset because he needed to play something.. i said no, though things couldve ended quicker if i just gave it.. but he was Nasty and i mean it, I MEAN IT!!!!!! so i repeatedly said no and he was just saying the meanest stuff, like ‘i hope your surgery doesn’t go well so i can just take the vr for myself’ as he kept banging.. eventually he was starting to take my doorknob off as i tried so hard to hold the door closed, i was scared. i tried calling my mom & dad from their room, and on the phone too, but they didnt respond ;; he took my doorknob off and took the vr and i just sat there sobbing my eyes out. he sees me as weak and incapable of doing anything, so he didn’t care about me crying. also, to be honest i didnt want him to hate me and call me a baby for calling my parents so i think i stopped after a bit. i think he felt bad(?) and put my doorknob back & gave the vr back but gosh that was the worst experience.
i can’t even trust him :( i came out to him months ago too and he doesnt use my respected pronouns, atleast he hasnt outted me yet though lol. i really dont know how much longer i can take this and based off the physical interaction its going to get worse from here. i hate him so much, i’m sorry but i wish he wasnt my brother. i would give anything for him to really love me. and i get told that he does love me and he cares, then why am i treated so cruelly? i feel unsafe around him.",2,3,1747621752.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kq0z5s/rantingneed_advice_about_brother/
1kpwphr,What do I do about my sibling?,s3rv1ngcvn1,"!! Disclaimer: I have horrible memory. Some information may be missing in the descriptions of what happened, because I simply don't remember, which might make the situation sound a bit weird. Also lowkey long post.

Hello! Before I explain the situation, I want to explain my family dynamic just a little bit. I also apologize if anything is explained weirdly, if I begin rambling or over explaining, I'm just trying to not miss out on any details that might be helpful.

I (16, F) am the oldest child of a family with three children. My bio siblings are 14, F and freshly 13, F.

I used to have a very strained relationship with both of my parents, especially when puberty first hit and around the time I was diagnosed with depressive episodes, but we're mostly neutral/getting better now.

My relationship with my bio siblings is hard to describe, it changes up a lot of the time.
This post is about my youngest bio sibling (the freshly 13 y/o), who we'll call Alex.

As background on Alex, they were an early bloomer in things of puberty, and they (atleast used to, I don't know if they still do) look up to me a lot, and copy a lot of the things I do. 
I'm assuming this lead them to think they're mature for their age, and should be allowed the things I am allowed, even though they quite literally were 12 up until a few days ago. My parents share this assumption.

(Example for this is hair dye. I began dyeing my hair when I was 13, almost 14. I dyed it red with Henna and kept that and black until I was 15, that is when I began using bleach and doing more funky colors. Alex began using bleach at 12, even after my mother said multiple times that she doesn't even like me using bleach, she doesn't want a 12 y/o to bleach their hair.)

They have a tendency to just disappear from home for hours without telling anyone where they're going, and then returning at past 10PM, or just not keeping to set return times in general, one time we called the police to report them as missing because they didn't come back after having supposedly gone to training, only for them to show up at nearly 11PM on a weekday, after having skipped training to go to a queer meet-up at a local bar. 

My parents always get very frustrated when things like that happen, or when they steal money, or break any other rule, because they don't know what to do. Because how do you show a 12 year old that their actions have consequences? They already barely have their phone/tablet because of their many f ups, because that's the only thing my parents can actually enforce. If they grounded Alex, they'd just not come home directly after school, and they also don't actually want to ground anyone. 

Besides, Alex has a massive screentime problem, anytime they don't have their phone they go running around desperately to find something they can go online with. I've seen them open Instagram over out TV or the laptop we use for school work. One time they brought a school ipad home and spent the entire night on it, and when my mother found out and told them to give it back, they didn't and instead hid it outside, and then got it once my mother thought they'd given it back. 

Now, what actually made me write about all this is something that happened this evening, after dinner.

My parents sat us down to talk about screentime, and the topic of Alex's screentime came up again. My parents criticized them for being on their phone so much and letting it distract them from schoolwork, which is causing them to possibly not even get into the next grade.

There was a fight, I don't remember about what exactly, most likely about limiting Alex's screentime more.
While my father and they were discussing that, my mother had gone upstairs to get me pain meds (I had asked for them because of period cramps). My mother keeps the pain meds in the same place as our lunch money, and when she came back downstairs she was pissed, because someone had stolen nearly half of next week's lunch money.

Alex is the only possible suspect, my father has no reason to take our lunch money and would've said something, my other bio sibling earns her money by doing small tasks for our mother, and is just the golden child who would never do that in general, and I don't even know where the money and meds are kept, and I also have enough money of my own, so Alex is the only possible person who could have taken it. 
They absolutely snapped when my mother confronted them, and got up to run upstairs while screaming and crying. My mother was standing in the doorway they had to take, and when she tried talking to them when they passed. They punched her.

My mother is shocked at them using violence against her, and my jaw actually just dropped when I saw that.

I want to make clear that my parents are not physically abusive, before anyone starts that theory. They're not the greatest emotionally, and have said questionable things, but other than rare play fights, there has never been physically violence in our house. I don't know where this came from, and I don't know how to handle it, or how to handle Alex in general.
I know that I'm not their mother, and I shouldn't concern myself with that too much, but I still do, and I know that it might be puberty, but puberty isn't a reason for physically assaulting a parent.

What do you do with a kid who does that? Where did that even come from?

To everyone who read until here, thank you so much, I'm so sorry if anything was unclear, I'll answer any questions that come up as good as I can. Have a good day/night/whatever!",4,6,1747608439.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kpwphr/what_do_i_do_about_my_sibling/
1kpvzb8,Letter to my father,Advanced-cat-brain,"Letter to My Father

I don’t know where to start, since I know you won’t read this letter. But in another life, maybe you wouldn’t even have needed a letter to be a better father.

I already wrote you one, when I was 9 years old, after you broke several pieces of furniture that my mother had bought, just because you had forgotten where you put your wallet and we weren’t much help. But all you did after reading it was yank me violently. Then you just sat there, as if nothing had happened.

I know it’s impossible to make you see reason, to show you how much of a bad father you were. But I also know that communication has never been a solution with you.

When we lived with you, you kept talking about how many sacrifices you made for us—but did you ever wonder if that wasn’t simply the normal price to pay when you choose to bring life into the world?

I never asked to be born. In fact, I would’ve said no if I had known you would be my father. What a misfortune… You never sacrificed your anger issues. You came home scaring everyone, woke us up in the middle of the night to look for your things when you lost them, punished us by locking the house to stop us from going to school if we didn’t do what you wanted. You yelled at us in front of our friends and neighbors; you hit our mother in front of us and threatened to do the same to us if we didn’t obey you.

But the question is: why? Why did you feel the need to make us suffer? Why did you never show us how a loving father treats his family? And finally, why do you never remember or speak of any of it?

It’s ironic how I still watch videos about gentle parenting and cry. I talk about you to my friends, and they never laugh when I try to turn my trauma into jokes. I used to hear family members say: “At least your father doesn’t smoke or drink.” But why would a loving father who smokes or drinks be worse? At least he’s only harming his own health, not others’.

I convinced myself that maybe you deserved a little love because you never sexually assaulted us. But how sad it is to have to use that as a threshold for abuse.

I tried everything with you. I tried obeying, ever since I was 3 years old when I realized you broke things when you were angry. I obeyed, cleaned up after you, didn’t cry in front of you because I knew it would make you scream at my mother. And I waited… until I was 9, when my mother decided we had to move in with you because of her work, after discovering you were cheating on her.

But things got worse: too many debts we never benefited from, too many outbursts, and too many changes. You stayed angry. Every time you came home from work, I had stomachaches from anxiety. Everything had to be arranged your way, or all hell would break loose. And the next day, I had to lie to my friends to explain the shouting and fighting in our apartment.

At 13, I’d had enough. I started defending myself verbally—I was tired of being the slave of the one who was supposed to protect me. But it only made your behavior worse.

Everything became unbearable when my mother left and I lived alone with you and my little sister. I felt like we didn’t experience things the same way, because I’m much more sensitive.

That year was the worst. You made me prefer death over obeying you. You stopped me from sleeping and seemed to take pleasure in it. You walked me to school with a stick in your hand like I was livestock. You starved me for days, to the point where I had to ask my friends for food. Why? Because I didn’t help clean the house? Because I didn’t wake up in time for school?

So I started defending myself physically, but you were stronger, and I was judged for it. Even my mother judged me. She once said: “I’ve seen all kinds of difficult children, but I’ve never seen one hit their father.”

But is it normal to see your father hit your mother and never react? Is it normal to be locked up the night before an exam and have to push him away to escape? Is it normal that no one judged him when he hit me in the face on my birthday? When he slapped me because I wasn’t walking fast enough behind him? When he beat me for arguing with my sister?

All of this is ""normal,"" but I’m the one who should be ashamed. Even in religion, I was forced to ask his forgiveness when I defended myself, because I was afraid of going to hell.

I kissed his hands like a slave every day, from the time I was 3 until I left Morocco. But I hated it. I couldn’t not do it, or he would make the day worse.

I hated you, but you were pitiful, always talking about how people ruined your life, about your unfulfilled dreams. You talked so much that I ended up feeling sorry for you.

So now the question is: what do I want from you? Well, nothing for myself, because you’ve already destroyed my childhood. The only thing I want is for you to treat my mother and little sister well.

Either you change, and become a good father for the years you have left, or, if you stay violent—mentally and physically—then go as far away as possible and never come back.

This letter could have been read by you, if you were a reasonable person. But you’re not, and that’s sad for both of us.

With all my regrets,
Your child.

I am (29F) living with my brother (33M). I have recently shifted to his city for work.
He doesn't really speak to me at all , (last one year when we were in different cities, I think we barely spoke). Now, when I am living with him, he still doesn't want to speak to me. We might exchange one sentence one week, that's it. We both have hectic 9-6 jobs.
Idk he just doesn't like me or hates me for whatever reason, I have tried to have a relationship with him but he doesn't reciprocate & now that I am bruised by other life traumas I don't have it in me to try to mend the relationship.

As living in this house is adding to my mental stress,
I want to move out.
But my parents want me to stay in his house because 1. Safety (as this city is particularly unsafe) 2. It's a fairly decent house, with servants (he has a good job ) 3. A fair distance from my workplace 

Help me come up with an excuse to move out.

So to be able to drop off and pick up my daughter to school Ive been working evening shifts for the last 3 years. My mum works 9-5, my brother as well. My partner has never had a stable job, he sleeps instead at home and go out to drink, he loves drinking. It's supposed me and him to pay all of the bills, the rent, and the food. But most of the time he can not support me as what he earns he spends on alcohol. My mum buys things for my brother and prepares his food. Whenever I can I cook as well, I maintain the cleanliness of the house as well. But she blames me that the only thing I do is that I run away from my daughter, that's why I go to work. There are 2 blockes at the house, my partner and my brother, they almost never go shopping, barely help me to pay off the rent, btw my mum doesn't pay rent, she buys food for mo brother, which all of us eat too. She blames me that the only thing I do is that I use my job to run away from responsibilities.

My family is a sensitive family, we weren’t ever much able to be able to tell people to get on out, and my mom and sister makes a lot of excuses. 
The dude is now 18 and she is 15 and they still mess around and he still freeloads, doesn’t pay no money, doesn’t hang out with the family, just lays in her bed and they mess around whenever in there. He has been influencing her to drop out and he is real bossy, entitled even, like yeah he seems cool, but he is not good. He talks to minors on his phone already, and even when my mom told him not to come over anymore, he would still come over, he would sneak in himself. Her room is in front of the front door so it’s easy, I made a mistake a while ago by agreeing to switch rooms. 

But anyways, my sister is making excuses and all that, thinking it’s fine that this 18 year old is messing with her, and she has said she doesn’t want him, but she still lets him around. It is so annoying and it really breaks my heart, and my words are never taken seriously in this house, my entire family gets offended at my opinions. And they all argue and make excuses, I want to make a police report but I don’t want to be in the drama, I get bad adrenaline. And I will get too guilty for my mom but she needs to get in trouble too for child endangerment and neglect. I don’t mean to say too much
but I know that Reddit does have a lot of people saying a lot but anyways..
I am not the type to fully speak my mind, I either get emotional and my mind goes crazy, and then I go silent, but I also have issues expressing myself, I don’t know why, I want to think I was traumatized because I’ve been this way for years, slowly getting better. And both my parents are narcissistic, especially my mom, she has her brothers thinking Shes in a bad place and shes just really hurting, she got about $7k from step dad who is separated and that was some really nice stuff he did for THE KIDS, guess what, like 5% of that money was spent on the kids, we were supposed to get a car, but then she spent it all on her druggy friends and drugs. 

My family breaks my heart, and knowing that I’m not a part of it definitely helps me a little, but it sucks that I have to be looked at like them, I’m not like my sister or mom especially, they both are narcissistic and hoe-like… I want to ask to live with my dad but I don’t want to be a burden on him, and my sister hates him because he doesn’t accept of her actions. But anyways, enough venting about all that lmao

I need help knowing fully what to do, mind you, I’m a guilty person, I don’t have the heart to put people in a bad situation, but these current situations are slowly getting worse, with the fact that no one seems to see the truth, my mom ruins it all, my dad doesn’t try to see us a lot, and my step dad has a new son with another woman

And my uncles are in their own situation, don’t have kids though

1kprog2,I think I hate my family and I need advice,Upper-Discipline-284,"I can't help but hate my family, my mother is the only one I like. I'm an only child who lives with both parents and my grandmother (dad's mother). Recently, i've come to realize that I cant stand my father and my grandmother at all and i'm so clueless. My father is absent and always on his phone. I can't even remember the last time I had a conversation with him. To top it all off, he has no patience and constantly throws stuff around and yells at my mother, which led me to be very jumpy and hyper aware of his moods and constantly anxious in my own house. My mother is a saint who can forgive him time and time again, but I can't look at him without hating him. My mother is constantly ranting to me about any fights they have (which is just my father yelling) and while i'm glad she confides in me, I cant take it anymore. I'm only 16 and i don't know how to handle any of this. My mother also shared a lot of conerning stuff about my grandmother and it honestly makes me sad for her. My grandmother doesnt appriciate my mother and constantly ridicules her every move. When my grandfather was sick, it was my mother who cared for him, bought his medicines and dealt with his appointments and she was even forced the quit her job to take care of him. As I said, my father is very absent in out lives. When he comes back from work, he doesnt move or help out or even talk to us. My father is extremely lazy and weaponizes incompetence. It's always my mother dealing with the bank stuff or any stuff in general with no help from them. I'm constantly scared and  with every interaction with my father i have it gets worse. I can't do anything without the thought of what if i piss him off and he yells at my mother again. I'm always on edge around him, fearing any word or anything I do will set him off and hit me. My grandmother adds fuel to his anger by supporting his temper tantrums. My mother has it worse than me but whenever she gets yelled at she takes it out on me.

1kpro27,I think I hate my family,Upper-Discipline-284,"I can't help but hate my family, my mother is the only one I like. I'm an only child who lives with both parents and my grandmother (dad's mother). Recently, i've come to realize that I cant stand my father and my grandmother at all and i'm so clueless. My father is absent and always on his phone. I can't even remember the last time I had a conversation with him. To top it all off, he has no patience and constantly throws stuff around and yells at my mother, which led me to be very jumpy and hyper aware of his moods and constantly anxious in my own house. My mother is a saint who can forgive him time and time again, but I can't look at him without hating him. My mother is constantly ranting to me about any fights they have (which is just my father yelling) and while i'm glad she confides in me, I cant take it anymore. I'm only 16 and i don't know how to handle any of this. My mother also shared a lot of conerning stuff about my grandmother and it honestly makes me sad for her. My grandmother doesnt appriciate my mother and constantly ridicules her every move. When my grandfather was sick, it was my mother who cared for him, bought his medicines and dealt with his appointments and she was even forced the quit her job to take care of him. As I said, my father is very absent in out lives. When he comes back from work, he doesnt move or help out or even talk to us. My father is extremely lazy and weaponizes incompetence. It's always my mother dealing with the bank stuff or any stuff in general with no help from them. I'm constantly scared and  with every interaction with my father i have it gets worse. I can't do anything without the thought of what if i piss him off and he yells at my mother again. I'm always on edge around him, fearing any word or anything I do will set him off and hit me. My grandmother adds fuel to his anger by supporting his temper tantrums. My mother has it worse than me but whenever she gets yelled at she takes it out on me. I don't think she realizes she does that, but I can feel it. Everytime my father scolds her, anything I do make her angry and she scolds and hits me.

1kprl6k,Parents,dababycarhead,"17M. My mom is manipulative and my dad is an alcoholic. At times our family is pretty normal, but mostly it's constant yelling and screaming. They yell at me, at eachother and at themselves by me. My dad is pathetic, he can't live a single day without alcohol. He also always escapes his problems - just leaves the house to smoke and play his stupid games on his phone. My mom uses tears to manipulate me, she always uses such childish ways to do that. I'm so glad it doesn't work on me since years, because I don't love her. They always demand respect, but I have absolutely none of it for them. I've never felt love from them as I can remember (I'm sure they do love me, but they show it so so rarely, that I don't even consider it as sign of love) only constant yelling and demanding. I'm grateful that they feed me, buy me clothes etc. but that's my maximum. They didn't tell me how to be a good person, how to treat people and how to know how you should be treated. Internet, friends, other family members did. Often I feel really alone, I really want someone to truly love me, just for who I am. I have a brother that is 6 years older and he already lives on his own. He mostly abandoned my parents, he wants nothing to do with them. He experienced far worse from them than I did. My parents hope that I won't abandon them like he did. I will. I'll cut all ties with them after I move out. I hope my brother will help me. Him, my grandma and my cousin are only family members that I'm 100% sure I love. 
I've been a shut-in for 2 last years. From July 2024 to the end of March 2025 I've struggled with serious AI characters addiction (Character.ai, Janitor, etc.). I've spent 10-15 hours a day first 6 months of using them. This really destroyed me. Everyday I'm building a better version of myself. I've started kickboxing, playing basketball with friends (planning on attending paid basketball lessons), going outside more often. Also I'm planning on attending art classes, to meet new people, besides learning how to draw. My health is better, my mentality us better. But... my parents make it worse. They they humiliate, belittle me, laugh at my flaws. Just an hour ago I've had a big argument with them. They don't know, but I have big study loose ends that I tie up every day for hours. They think I play videogames, so when they demand (yes, demand) to help them and I say that I'm studying, they think I'm lying. The semester ends 4th of June and after that there's a week of exams from my college (Anatomy, nursing and history of the country). I HAVE to write my unfinished assignments for HOURS to have more time for studying for exams. My mom was really offended when I refused helping her in favour of my studies, which she thinks are videogames. I fear that my parents will stop giving me money for kickboxing and the other paid activities I'm planning on attending. My scholarship is 1510 hryvnas (36$) every month, my kickboxing lessons are 250 hryvnas (6$) for 1 lesson, I attend them for 8 times a month, so it's 2000 hryvnas (48$) a month.

1kpqxg3,Stiefvater plötzlich zu nett oder ist das flirten?,AmphibianGlad6591,"Liebe Leute,
Ich (w,27) habe von meinem 11. bis zu meinem 17. Lebensjahr mit meiner Mutter und meinem neuen „Stiefvater“ im Haus meines Stiefvaters gelebt. Meine Mutter wohnt immer noch mit ihm zusammen.
Das Verhältnis zwischen ihm und mir war immer wieder angespannt, Konflikte zwischen mir und den beiden standen an der Tagesordnung. Da ich auf dem Dorf lebte, war ich auf Fahrdienste angewiesen, worin sie mich sehr unterstützt haben. Ansonsten wollte ich so früh ausziehen, da ich mich aufgrund der Konflikte dort nicht wirklich wohl fühlte…Es hat einige Jahre gedauert bis ich eine gewisse Basis zu meiner Mutter und auch zu ihm aufbauen konnte, sodass gegenseitige Besuche möglich wurden. Darin hat mich mein jetziger Freund mit dem ich schon 10 Jahre zusammen bin, unterstützt. 
Meine „Eltern“, also meine Mutter und mein „Stiefvater“ haben in den letzten Jahren viel durchgemacht, weil meine Mutter krank war. 

Jetzt kommt die Crux. Letztens als ich aufgrund von längerer Erkältung bei ihnen übernachtet habe (ohne meinen Freund) und meine Mutter arbeiten war, kam mein Stiefvater auf mich zu, drückte mir Geld in die Hand und gab mir plötzlich einen Kuss auf die Wange, drückte mich und sagte, dass ich das Geld verdient habe und er sehr stolz auf mich ist, weil ich mich so entwickelt habe. Ich glaube er hat da auch etwas Alkohol getrunken gehabt. Die Umarmung und der Kuss wirkten befremdlich auf mich. Ich stand wie gelähmt da und konnte es kaum annehmen. Nun ist es so, dass er immer, wenn er mich kurz alleine sieht, mir Komplimente zu meiner Optik macht à la „du siehst heute gut aus“ oder „das steht dir gut“…dann drückt er mich jetzt öfters fester als sonst, aber vor allem wenn kein anderer dabei ist (sonst distanziert). 
Na klar könnte ich es als „Stärkung des Stiefvater-Tochter-Verhältnisses“ ansehen, aber für mich schwingt da eine neue Ebene mit, die ich so bisher nicht kenne. Ich fühle mich damit nicht wirklich wohl. Nun weiß ich nicht, wie ich aus dieser Lähmung am besten rausgehen soll. Das letzte mal als ich bei den beiden zu Besuch wer, habe ich eher den Abstand zu ihm gesucht und er hat meinen Freund bedrängt oder wollte immer wieder mit ihm weg gehen und etwas zeigen… da hatte ich den Eindruck, dass er seine Grenze nicht wirklich respektiert hat und ihn auch von mir entzerren wollte. 
Ich möchte ihm keine falschen Absichten unterstellen, aber ich fühle mich mit der aktuellen Situation unterdrückt und weiß mir gerade nicht besser zu helfen, als den Abstand zu suchen. Mir ist bewusst, dass dieser Fluchtmodus nicht die Antwort auf das Problem ist.

Yes, he has a good side, especially when cats are dying, he will cry. He was also harassed by a gay person when he was a teenager, and he thinks that his mother abandoned him because his twin got sick, leading him to believe that no one loved him at that time. However, despite all the wrongdoings he has caused, his wife forgave him, but he is still being a jerk most of the time. Is it reasonable for me, as his daughter, to not forgive him?

1kpmepd,Si stepmom,tokischia,"
So here's a lil context about how my dads mistress become my ""stepmom""  OFW ang father ko that time and my mom is here sa Philippines, kaya nakilala ni papa si ""stepmom"" is because binugaw ng tita ko (kapatid ni papa) alam ni tita at ni ""stepmom"" na may asawa't pamilya ang papa ko, pero dahil nga malandi at mukhang pera ay kinabog kabog ang papa ko at eto namang tatay ko ay pumatol.

 Year 2016 my mom died due to many illness, diabetes and so on. After my mom's death wala pang dalawang linggo umuuwi na si ""stepmom"" here sa bahay namin, nag iiwan ng mga bra at panty sa bahay knowing na may makakakita. After a week pinakilala sakin ni papa and another week inuwi na niya dito sa bahay namin ang anak niya at pinasalo sa tatay ko lahat. And after so many weeks, months, e talagang puro kami away hindi ko maitatanggi na talagang sinasagot ssgot ko siya, e bakit hindi? 

Back to the current issue, nang hihingi ako ng pera for my errands tomorrow since wala na akong pasok at wala na talaga akong pera and hindi ako nang hihingi ng pera sa papa ko ng madalas, ngayon lang. Nang hihingi ako ng 50 pesos para pang pamasahe lang etong si stepmom si bukang bibig ""walang pera"" e kahit alam ko na meron, tapos ginising niya ang papa ko saying na nang hihingi ako ng pera ang ending si papa ay sinigaw sigawan ako, i'm not asking for too much money and ngayon lang ako humingi ng pera since natapos school ko. After ako mapagalitan maya maya umalis si ""stepmom"" at ang anak niya, bumili ng pagkain. And again, ramdam ko nanaman na kapag sila ang hihingi ng pera ay dapat okay lang at mag bibigay ang papa ko, pero kapag sakin, parang bawal na bawal e ako ang anak? Minor pa lang ako at wala pang trabaho para mag karon ng sariling pera. 50 PESOS lang ang hinihingi ko pero ang nagastos nila e mahigit 200 PESOS.

Hindi ko alam anong mararamdaman ko, wala akong ibang mapupuntahan kundi sarili ko lang, kung hindi lang mahalaga ang errands ko for tommorow e hindi ako hihingi.",1,0,1747581577.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kpmepd/si_stepmom/
1kpifm8,How do you reconcile disliking a person you supposedly love (aka your mother),moeluk,"I have slowly but surely emerged from a series of realisations over the last few months / years…an emotional spring clean if you want. Job 1 completed: realising that my ‘mates’ were just abusing me emotionally having previously financially abused me (spending years conning me with poker out of a rigged deck)

Reconnected with some older friends, and started making new ones where I now live.

Now I’ve come to the realisation that whilst I love my mother, as she creeps further into her old age (currently in her mid 70s) the more and more I dislike her. For instance yesterday travelled 5 hours to see her and take her for lunch, and to suggest a new car she might like before her existing one explodes and is worth nothing…(which I have no doubt it will) and frustratingly she had already dismissed it before we got to the showroom….now she wouldn’t say why but 100% it’s because she considers Renault’s “poor people cars” it’s not a BMW so it’s not good enough.

Then she said, she did like an older 3 series or a an Audi TT, totally missing the point that I’m trying to future proof her, save her money and that she’s had a hip replacement done…so maybe a low to the ground bone shaker like a TT is probably not the best idea….

Either way as the above example shows she’s very materialistic and as she gets older is turning into a nightmare. At some point I’m going to have to take control….but how do you deal with someone like that? I’m 99% sure she hates the fact I’ve been with my partner for a decade and have 4 step kids and won’t be giving her, her “own” grandchild…

1kpi8bx,Child’s father has a new girlfriend who’s mentally unstable..,Typical_Shine_5863,"What would you do?….

Me and my child’s father were never in a relationship, we casually slept together and hung out for around 2 years. Around the time we stopped sleeping together I found out I was around 15 weeks pregnant, at the time he had slept with (once) his good friend and employee’s very recent ex girlfriend. He wanted me to have a termination but due to how far along the pregnancy was I decided against it, he decided to pursue a relationship with the new woman at this time. 

Here where things get a bit f*cked, so obviously we are talking about the pregnancy and scheduling in missed appointments to catch things up since finding out late ect, he tells me after him and the new girlfriend have been together less than 3 weeks that I need to start including her in the pregnancy ect ‘because she’s going to be the step mum’ naturally this annoys and disgusts me, I always knew the guy was immature but I really didn’t think he would be this complacent about his own child’s safety. I told him that I understood we will both have new relationships at so stage in our lives and our son will evidently meet new partners, but that it needs to be something we discuss and set healthy boundaries around. I told him that if he and his girlfriend were still together in 12 months that we would look at her meeting and spending time with the baby, given he wasn’t even born yet! 

His obsession with this new girlfriend being the child’s step mum is a very toxic situation, and I wouldn’t have my guard up so much if it wasn’t for the fact that I know about her past (I was seeing my baby’s father and she was seeing his friend) so we were associated as a friendship group, which I why I know that she struggles immensely with depression, anxiety and likely other mental health conditions. She attempted to commit suicide on two occasions that I know of and would self harm every time she drinks alcohol (almost daily basis at the time of her previous relationship) Now that my son is 3 months old, it’s been nothing but an inconsiderate, insensitive time where his father is more concerned with his girlfriend being involved than he is even being involved in his sons life himself. Now knowing all of this, I’m so scared to eventually have to leave my vulnerable child with him and this person, not knowing if she will suffer a mental episode while caring for him, hurt him and who’s knows what, it’s made me so stressed about the entire situation. 

His entire family seem to encourage his dysfunctional behaviour and support the narrative of this woman being the step mother and them both having care of the child as soon as the court will allow them to which is even more distressing for me as his mother. I am completely alone without any family nearby (they are in a different state). My sons father hasn’t once helped with an overnight, helped his his sons colic episodes, helped me with any house work, baby’s needs, nothing! 

How would you navigate this situation? I’m so sick to my stomach with the whole thing.

1kpgah5,Mum misunderstands then accuses me,mosho84,"My sister (and her young kids) has been estranged from our family for a few years now but she actively posts on social media. This has obviously been a source of sadness and frustration in the family. Today I received a very confrontational message from my mum accusing me of speaking to my sister but not telling my parents. First she wouldn't tell me what makes her think I was speaking to my sister. Eventually she told me that my sister posted about thanking her family for buying lot of food for her. I can't access my sister's social media accounts as I'm blocked so I asked for a screenshot but my mum wouldn't send one. Eventually I managed to get someone to screenshot it for me. The message was ""Grateful for the food, the family and friends, and the love between us"". So my mum clearly misunderstood the message and accused me. She finished the conversation by saying ""I hope you're telling the truth"".

I feel very pissed off about it. I'm supposed to be visiting my parents today but I'm very angry. When I'm upset with them about something, I usually wouldn't want to visit them to avoid dealing with the situation but I would like to be a better person this time, face things calmly, and communicate properly (which I'm not good at).

They claimed I have the money (which I don’t, I have about 1k in savings which is for when ever my car might break)

Maybe as she does live in a house that I bought rent free. And she said she might but I just don’t want to go but also have FOMO about this because I dunno I don’t have a lot of family and I’d like to spend time with them but just not in New York City 😂

1kpay43,My husband won’t let me put my daughter on ADHD medication!,whohurtus,"I have a 12-year-old daughter, and for a long time, I’ve suspected she has ADHD. She struggles to follow instructions, especially if she’s given more than one at a time. She often zones out, becomes easily frustrated or angry, and takes a very long time to complete even simple tasks. She doesn’t respond well to criticism and has a hard time expressing her emotions. After finally getting her evaluated, she was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Vyvanse. I want to start her on the medication to help her succeed and feel more in control, but my husband — her father — is completely against it. He doesn’t believe anything is wrong with her and is deeply concerned about the risks, especially knowing that Vyvanse is a stimulant and can be addictive if not used properly. What makes this even harder for me is that I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child too. I was prescribed medication, but my mother chose not to give it to me. That decision had a lasting impact on my life — it caused me years of struggle, confusion, and missed opportunities. I don’t want my daughter to go through the same pain I did. I want her to have the support and tools I didn’t get. But now I feel stuck between doing what I believe is best for her and trying to respect my husband’s fears and perspective.

1kp7lha,Is my mom going too far or am I just being a prude?,skyflower111,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before but I just need to know if my discomfort about this is valid or stupid. So, my mom (F48) has always been very open and comfortable about the topic of sex and sexuality to me (F16). She used to walk around naked a lot and would make fun of me when I told her it made me uncomfortable, however, when I was about 14-15 she finally stopped. When I was about 8, she told me she has a foot fetish and still makes comments about people’s feet and jokes about sexual stuff involving feet sometimes. It’s always weirded me out a lot, not to shame fetishes but I just DO NOT need to know that about my mom. She also always makes jokes about my sex life, whether it’s been existent or not. Like- when I had a boyfriend at 13, she dropped me off and said to him “use a condom!” in the first interaction they had, even though we were never even close to doing anything like that. I’ve always been very uncomfortable talking about anything sexual, especially with her, and I think it’s because she’s made it kind of an uncomfortable thing and gone too far in my opinion. Earlier today I told her she was giving rebellious teenage girl vibes when talking to her boyfriend, and then she referred to him as “daddy” right in front of me because of that. It made me grossed out but they both were acting like it was usual and I’m the one who started it with my comment. I know my mom has good and playful intentions, and is a great person. And I’m also completely fine with my friends talking to me about sexual things, I just feel very uncomfortable and weird about the things my mom has said and done but i know she doesn’t understand why, and thinks I’m just being a prude.

1koy73s,I Am Number Three,,"I know this is a long ass post. I don't expect everyone to read it. But I need to get it out of my head. 

I want to forget about everything they did, and kept me from doing. But I'm still paying for their arrogance and stupidity at 24. I've lost countless opportunities for a life worth living. Because of my father, mother, older brother and sister. 

I've been off adderall for 5 years. I've quit smoking weed at least 4 times. Things are rough, but I'm still trying to do better. This post is to vent. If you want to start a fight. I bet there's a subreddit just for that. 

Memories from when I was a kid keep me up at night. Still trying to understand how people could be so stupid. I still rely on meds to get decent sleep. The earliest I remember was a bad trip to Disney when I was 6. My brother, sister, and dad bullying me for only being tall enough to ride the plane. Height restrictions are common knowledge. But that wasn't even considered before spending thousands on a trip that not all of their children could enjoy. 

That instance sticks with me. Because it sums up my whole relationship with them. And They homeschooled me until 6th grade.

I never found out why. But beef has always fucked with my stomach. That was my dad's favorite food. So when I told him that going to bed hungry was better than eating what he made. He left marks that lasted weeks. He'd make me go without any food at all for days at a time. When people asked why I hadn't eaten, or wasn't ALLOWED to eat at a public event. He'd just say I was ""picky and hard-headed."" And people left it alone. Despite the fact that I look like a corpse in every childhood photo. My stomach is still the size of a child's. 

Both parents are dangerously arrogant. My dad would spend all day getting pissed at everyone else, to come home and take it out on a 5'4"" woman and his own kids. Without a drop of alcohol. My mom had been cheating since I was in middle school and thinks she can tell others who to date. 

My mother was a special kind of stupid. She's never paid a bill in her life. But when my brother or sister were practicing for their sports, or attending their clubs. I'd be in the car with her. Hearing her scream so loud about how expensive their activities were that it echoed. My skin was always red, itching, and burning from the soap and detergent she bought. And she'd just scream at me for ""being a baby."" 

When I was 11. My dad got me paternity tested. Because the son of a civil engineer can't flunk a math test. He'll never admit it. But there's only one thing he would've actually wanted to know from a blood drawing. 

After that, every grade below C got me dragged back the hall to get my ass beat. Carpet burns on my ankles and shins. And some marks that are still visible in my twenties. He would even wait an hour and then pull me into the bathroom to check me for bruises so that he could tell me how I ""really got them."" 

My 11th birthday was the worst one I've had. I only had 3 friends I could invite. We had a pretty good time playing DS and Wii. But 3 of us had the DS Lite. One had the DSi. That uses a different charger that he left at home. When his started to die, my father learned of the problem and pinned me to the wall by my neck. It took all of my friends and my older brother telling him we didn't have the charger to save me from suffocating. 

I woke up later than all of my friends the morning after. They'd gone outside while I was pouring my cereal. My dad walked into the kitchen, saw me by myself, and without saying anything started dragging me back the hall. While I'm yelling ""I have to eat!"" When we got back to his room he literally threw me on the floor. I got back up and told him. I had to eat again. And he belted my face so hard I thought I'd lost my nose. He proceeded to mark up my whole body while screaming about me being a ""failure"" My friends saw the marks. And were visibly shocked. But nobody said anything. 

He told me I wouldn't remember that night for the fun I had, but for the pain I endured. And credit where it's due. That's the one time he told me the truth. But it beats my 10th birthday. Where I asked to go to a superhero movie my parents didn't approve of. For trying to argue my case to them, I was sitting alone in a chair in the middle of our living room. And told I'd get my ass beat if I got up. 

When I was 12. I wanted to join the basketball team. Both of my parents went apeshit over march madness every year. So you'd think they'd at least get me the physical, but no. I begged until I cried. They did end up dragging me to the doctors office for ""The physical I needed so badly."" But signups had been closed for weeks. I argued my case the year after, but my brother piped up out of nowhere (Without them telling him it's not his business) and said verbatim: ""Basketball is for pretty boys who think they have everything! You should run cross country with me!"" 

And just like that. My next 5 years were decided. When I told them I didn't want to play guitar, audition for the musical, run track, or march in the band. My father literally put a hole in my forehead that didn't close for 2 months. The bones in my skull have only been in the right spots for about 2 years now. 

I spent most of 16 years alone in their basement. Because I hurt their ego, just by existing. 

Therapists were the people who screwed me over worse than anyone else. My parents forced me to go when I was 15 because I told them college was a waste of time and money. 

I never had a chance to figure out my own interests, talents, or opportunities until I had one year of school left.

When my older sister offered me weed. I took it. I'll always regret that. When anyone asks me, ""Why?"" It was just because I wanted to feel something other than hopeless. 

At 16. I made enough from my job to pay for martial arts classes. I almost broke a dude's arm for trying to steal my lunchbox. My dad didn't touch me after doing that. Because he wouldn't put hands on someone who could fight back.

I was 17 when I joined the National Guard. The ""behavioral health"" girl got a bonus check for every soldier she ""diagnosed."" I was branded autistic and wasn't allowed to do the job they paid me to train for. Because I didn't lie about my parents sending me to therapy. 

I was a carpentry and masonry specialist in the Corps of Engineers. I finally got to be proud of something I did on my own. To build barracks for other soldiers and shelter for refugees. But I never got to. 

I passed the physical exam for flight school with flying colors. But the feds have my autism ""diagnosis"" on file. So I'm not even allowed to apply. I'm not even allowed to learn a trade. To pass or fail on my own. 

I'm stuck on the ground in one of the poorest counties in the country. Not good enough to leave. 

My golden boy brother is 27 and still in college. He'll be in debt for the rest of his life. My sister almost went to jail for worse drugs than weed. And they bailed her out 4 or 5 times. I'm in no debt and have no record. After all that, I'm still the ""lazy one."" For everything, THEY DIDN'T LET ME DO. IN HIGH SCHOOL.

I'm still living at my father's house. My younger sister has been put through enough by that asshole. As angry as I am about not being able to afford a house of my own, I'm happy I get to be there for my sister. She still has 2 years of school left. Having grown up in this house, I feel responsible for her. Because my parents have neglected her about as bad they did me. 

My friendship with my younger sister and cousins has made me strong. Not my parents bullshit. I've gotten to be a father to them more than asshole my dad and uncle. And I wouldn't change that for the world. 

Sorry for the wall. It just feels good to be heard. Or read in this case.",3,1,1747502408.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1koy73s/i_am_number_three/

Well, recently I found out its because he's been sleeping with the girls mother.

1kosc14,My mom is going to be homeless but she won’t stop lying about everything,thewickedhiker,"Thank you for reading if you’re here 🥲

Some background: I’m 26F, living with my fiancé (28M) about an hour north of my mom. We recently bought a 3-bedroom house we’ve been remodeling ourselves. It’s still a work in progress—one room doesn’t even have drywall or flooring yet and is currently being used to store our tools and paint. Our bedroom is finished, but the guest room doesn’t even have a door yet (we still need to buy them) and is also doubling as a storage space. We live with our three cats.

Now, onto my mom. She’s a pathological liar. It’s something I’ve tolerated for years because most of her lies are small and don’t cause major harm. But it still bothers everyone who knows her—she lies constantly, doubles down when questioned, and ends conversations instead of owning up to anything.

Two years ago, her lying became a serious issue. She was kicked out of the house where my sisters and I grew up, but she told everyone she had sold it voluntarily. She assured us she had somewhere to go. She didn’t.

When I called her to check in during her “move,” she was panicked and said she needed help moving a U-Haul and her car. I rushed over after work and found the house in a terrible state—completely unprepared, dirty, and filled with trash bags. There was grime all over the floor, a fridge that looked like it hadn’t worked in years, and everything that couldn’t be moved alone was simply left behind: her bedroom set, my childhood room, my sister’s belongings—years of memories just abandoned.

She admitted she had nowhere to go. I did the only thing I could think of: I got her into one of the apartments owned by the company I worked for. I signed the lease myself, put it under my name, and paid the full deposit and rent out of pocket, knowing I wouldn’t see that money again. I even risked my job to get her off the street. She had just $40K coming in from the sale of the house but wouldn’t receive it for a few more days. She was in her car with my 12-year-old sister and their two dogs (a 5 lb chihuahua and a 200 lb mastiff), with nowhere to go.

My sister didn’t even know they were moving. When I picked her up, she was confused and asked if they were just going to check out a new place. My mom lied directly to her face and said they had just bought a new house.

Eventually, my mom repaid me for the apartment, but she then moved into a rental house for $2,600/month—completely unaffordable. I begged her not to. I hated watching her spend what little money she had furnishing the entire place from scratch, but she ignored me. She bought everything new—beds, couches, TVs, pillows, blankets—all to replace the things she left behind. I hoped she could stabilize in 6 months.

Fast forward to yesterday: I get a call from my mom. She has to be out of her rental by midnight. She claims she’s been paying rent but her landlord wasn’t paying the mortgage and the house is being reclaimed. She’s scrambling to move everything into a U-Haul. Once again, my sister knows nothing. My mom told my sister (WHILE SHE WAS MOVING HER SHIT INTO A UHAUL) that she would  leave the apartment unlocked so my sister and I could grab clothes for her dad’s house over the weekend. I ended up having to be the one to break the news: “Mom got kicked out. Everything is in a storage unit now.” My sister was devastated, unsure why my mom couldn’t be honest with her. My sister asked me if my mom had bothered to pack her bed. It makes me cry.

I don’t have the resources to help this time. I can’t house her, especially with the mastiff. We’re financially stretched thin from the remodel. My fiancé and I both work full-time and aren’t home during the day.

My sister is heartbroken. She’s supposed to go on a weeklong school trip to DC on Tuesday. My mom promised to drive her and her friend to the school that day. Now we’re not even sure if her things were packed or left behind again. Had we known what was happening, we could’ve at least made sure she brought her essentials to her dad’s house.

I’m just at a complete loss. My mom lies so much I never know what’s real. I know the obvious answer is “don’t believe anything,” but how am I supposed to help someone like that? I have nothing left to give, but I hate watching my sister go through this. I’m heartbroken and disappointed beyond words.

I honestly don’t know what to do. My mom refuses to be honest, refuses to take accountability, and seems to believe that if she ignores her problems long enough, a miracle will fix them. But no miracle comes. And now my little sister, once again, is the one suffering the consequences.",2,4,1747486525.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kosc14/my_mom_is_going_to_be_homeless_but_she_wont_stop/

1kor9j9,i don’t know what to do…,Comprehensive_Elk131,"this is not necessarily for me (23F) but rather my younger sister (17F) i’ll refer to her as K. Long story short, when she was around the age of 10 she got really cold to my dad. We didn’t understand why. She eventually told my sister (20F), i’ll refer to her as Y, that my dad had told her (K) not to tell anyone about when they were playing around. my sister Y (then about 13) didn’t know what to do so she went and told me. i asked her (K) what happened. K said they were playing around and he was tickling her and then he kissed her. but later told her not to tell anyone and it freaked her out. K said it was simply a peck and it only happened that once. my dad has always been an affectionate person and a small peck was normal as a child but it had always been innocent affection. obviously it didn’t continue after we got older. we all got together as a family and talked about this. my dad said the reason he said to not say anything was because he noticed K’s reaction was starting to become more of something “stimulating” to her so he stopped and didn’t want to make it embarrassing to K. he didn’t think too much of what he said.

as time went by, everything was back to normal. K and my dad’s relationship looked unaffected. though the possibility of that happening was always at the back of my mind from that point on and it really affected me. he never gave me a reason to think he did it on purpose before or after the incident. it made more sense it was miscommunication.

as my K got older, she started to be more secretive and never spoke to us about her thoughts, friends, or school. eventually we got a call from her high school that she got expelled after being caught vaping in the classroom. that was something unbelievable to us. Y and i were always calm and responsible, getting anything lower than a B was disappointing to us, let alone expelled. K was grounded and expelled for a week. K brought up the incident again, saying that what my dad did to her affected her. we spoke about it again and it seemed like we reached the same conclusion as before. he apologized and said he never meant for something like that to happen and make her feel like he was doing harm to her. 

K returned back to school but it made us question who she truly was. 

eventually through mutuals, Y was told that K had a boyfriend. we assumed K was embarrassed to tell us (since Y and i never had a relationship before) so we just kept quiet and waited until K felt comfortable enough to tell us. 

as K’s punishment for not doing well in school, my mom took away her phone. on there, was conversations with her boyfriend. an entire different person was in her phone and school. in her gallery we found nudes both of K and her boyfriend that they would send each other. there was conversation to her friends about them (K and her bf) skipping school and having sexual interactions in our family car (she drove herself to school in). it wasn’t having a boyfriend that we were worried about but rather how she was going about it. my parents were never strict with us in that aspect either. Y and i never were in relationships as a personal choice. however, K being secretive about it, sharing what is essentially child pornography, skipping school to goes god knows were, was what was wrong. they thought it was best to pull K out of school and do it online. her phone was taken away at first but eventually it was given back in short periods of time.

once again after looking through her phone we saw K was texting her boyfriend. honestly, didn’t really mind much since it was expected. however, it was disappointing since we offered her to meet with him in a public setting (as couples her age should be doing) but she refused and just kept contacting him secretly again. in those messages her boyfriend said that he was “mad that she is dealing with your moms emotional decisions” meaning that K’s punishment was simply do to my mom being “emotional”. essentially saying she (K) did no wrong. 

in that same conversation K said she will try to do something about my parents allowing her to go back to school the last week before summer break. later that day she was crying and when asked what was wrong she would say “nothing”. K spent the entire next day in bed sleeping and crying. eventually my mom got sick of her acting that way since it felt like it was a tantrum to let her go back to school. and in that confrontation she brought back the incident with my dad. saying it has affected her and that her friends and boyfriend are the only ones to make her happy. she continued to say that she never opened up to my sister (Y), my mom, and i was because we didn’t believe her when my dad did that to her. in that i told K we did, that’s why we spoke as a family and confronted him about it at first and it was settled as a misunderstanding. then K goes on and says that he actually would put his knee between her legs and rock her back and forth. he would also make out with her. and that it wasn’t only once but it went on for a month before she told us. my heart dropped. 

this was entirely different than what she had told us first and it would change the entire event. i told this to my dad and as i was observing his reaction to see if it was true, it looked like his eyes looked hurt rather than panic. he maintained his story on it and said that he never did anything to her other than innocent playing. K then went “that’s all i needed to hear” and stormed off. when i asked her what she meant by that, K said he kept saying it was innocent when it wasn’t. that “i was ten and he knew better” and K wanted him to admit that he SAed her basically. my dad said he wanted to go back and avoid that entire situation from ever happening and even told her that if she truly felt that he had hurt her to call the cops on him and he would gladly go. he just didn’t want to see her suffering anymore because of him. when she denied doing so he even offered moving out. but again declined. we offered her a therapist and she hesitantly agreed.

this entirely changed our family forever. the father i know and grew up with would rather die than hurt us. he never once made me doubt his intentions toward us or anyone. he had always been an anxious man that couldn’t lie for his life because his anxious tics would give him away. his heart has always been pure and loving. my other sister agreed as well. so him doing this to her was something my mind couldn’t fathom. i’ve heard stories of families not being there for their children that were SAed and to “protect” the family essentially denied it happening. i didn’t want to do that to her. my mom said that although she loves my father, she will always love her children more. my father said the same and understood if we wanted to believe K entirely. 

i don’t know what to think. i don’t deny this affecting my sister but at the same time i feel like i know her less than my dad. had Y been the one to say this, id have no doubt. but K makes me question things. why did her story change? okay sure maybe she was scared or didn’t realize to mention it. yet why does she coincidentally bring this up when she’s in trouble? maybe her emotions are heightened and her emotions spill out? why would she ever lie about something this serious? is she willing to make this up for her benefit? i’m not so sure

1kol80i,My boyfriend's family,OpportunityOk7758,"Hi me (23F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together since December 2020. 
We startes living together after 1 week, I did not know basically anything about his everyday life. How we decided to get together is a whole another story and is the end result of multiple other experiences in my past etc. 
So we started living together at his location which is near his whole family. And by near I mean that we see his father, mother, grandpa and grandma almost every day. They also have a family business together.
What is very weird to me is how these people here are. His parents just started to get a little comfortable with me and it's been 4 freaking years. They are very insecure people. In this part of our country the people are very jealous. They think only about what other people think. They have extremely closed mindset. Which is annoying and frustrating for me considering that I study philosophy, I have used drugs, I love partying, I am an adventurer by soul, my boyfriend understands those things and we are both good with them. Never mind that, I am raised to be good to people and I am really trying to be nice and kind and good because they are family and I want to have a good connection with them. 

But his parents and his sister and his whole family they are just ungrateful. 
I'm not going to go into detail about what I've done for them and how their respond I will just share basically how they act which for me is absolutely ridiculous. 
His sister has prom next month and she is absolutely ungrateful. Yesterday we tries to talk with her and her boyfriend about gifting them plane tickets for Rome which will be worth around 300 euros. And they started acting like we (me, my boyfriend, and his parents) should pay for their hotel too because it is embarrassing to gift something for prom for 300 euros. 
I just went crazy to be honest for me this is absolutely unbelievable and ungrateful and shit. 
His (my boyfriend's) parents are just as crazy and ungrateful. They always act as if I haven't cook or done anything nice and they will never say, thank you or ""it was delicious"" if I cooked something and I know I cook good. 
They never say ""I love you"" to my boyfriend and they almost never support him
I am just going out of my mind. My own family is not like them, my parents are very caring and they never act like that with us as a couple. 
My boyfriend tells me not to care and that they do not deserve my emotions and energy and I should not worry about them. Basically he is on my side, he sees that they are not acting normal. 
And I actually do care about them. I care that there is tasty food, that we do good, that we are happy and we have a decent present for his sister and her boyfriend for prom, or anything like that because that is how I'm raised and at the end of the day it is really nice when the whole family is good and we understand each other but with them.. It is never the case. 

I'm just really thinking of not talking to them the same way anymore and not talking to his sister for a while because this is ridiculous for me. She called her brother (my boyfriend) ""idiot"" because of those tickets and hotel yesterday and she said to us not to go to her prom. I just really want her to understand that this is not normal behavior for an 18 year old and that words have consequences. All those tiny scandals have built something in me for the last 4 years that really affects my relationship with my boyfriend. I am not even happy because of those things. It's really frustrating. 

Do you have any advise how can I cope with those people and get back my happiness in my relationship? Basically my question is - how can I deal with this so that I can feel better with myself because I can not change anyone and my boyfriend knows that those people are unchangeable and they are not worth worrying about emotionally. How can I safe myself from taking those things too personally? I just want to not give a shit about their stupid thinking and problems.

1kojamq,Is my mother actually right or am I just being the bad person here?,LocationUnlikely333,"So, I'll try to explain this as briefly as possible. 

My mom grew up believing never to talk to guys once you get to 6th grade. Her sisters told this to her and she passed on such beliefs onto me. I was told not to make any friends. I was told not to talk to anyone in school unless you need something from them. I used to be childish and joke around with my relatives, and this made her furious. She used to lecture me that I shouldn't laugh and joke around with people and just answer what they ask. Nothing else. 

Then i went to middle school and I was told not to talk to guys, as every Indian mom does. She then told me that I was an unwanted child and she and my dad were planning to send me off to my aunt after I was born. This was not a joke, I asked this to my relatives till I was 18, and they confirmed this every time. At this point I started forming unhealthy friendships and crushes with people which kept on happening till I was almost 20. Apart from this, a lot of thing weren't that different.

Then i went to high school and things started getting worse here. Apart from the study pressure, I started feeling very low, I was never happy, I was always in a tough spot. I didn't have any good friends. This is when my dad passed away and she and my brother became a team. He used to beat me up and she used to provoke him. There was never an instance when she thought I was in the right. My brother dislocated my gums due to which I needed teeth treatment for over a year. Yes, she never felt sympathy for me and she still thinks I deserved that. What did I do? I just said ""no"" to helping her in cooking, in a slightly irritated tone. That's it.

Then comes college. I made the worst possible friends here, I couldn't even know who is what? Other friends of mine actually knew what's right and wrong and I literally couldn't know shit about people who I considered friends. Yes I still made unhealthy bonds with people here. This is where she started slut shaming me, saying that I could sell myself to any guy, she loves victim blaming every person on the internet. She started looking at girls and getting obsessed with it. She never asked about anything in my life other than my ""female"" classmates. ""How many girls are in your project group?"", ""how many girls are in your company?"", ""how many girls are in your class?"" Etc.. never asked about people in general, just girls. She keeps judging every girl for what she wears and gets disappointed in any of my female friends have a boyfriend.

Not very surprising but I don't have a boyfriend. 

Now she keeps on repeating things like ""you have to be safe, if you live far away, you'll get kidnapped, if you trust guys, you'll get graped, never ever fall in love or get in a relationship""..

(I still hug my family sometimes and I'm okay with pats on the head etc.) However, my mom makes uhh...interesting comments about that when we're joking around. She'll say stuff like ""I'll touch your butt"" and ""you want me to caress your thigh?"". She's joking around too but it really ruins the mood for me and it's lowkey a weird thing to say to your child. It unsettles/is uncomfortable for me and I've communicated that with her. She responds by saying ""you're mine so I can do whatever I want to you"". Erm...
I've even cried in front of her a few times because of this since I REALLYYY don't like it. She ignores it half the time and gets mad the other half. Basically, she just ignores my boundaries. Like mentioned above, it's not like I don't allow any type of physical interaction. It's just that I'm not as clingy as anymore compared to like 5 years ago.

1koi83a,My sister has ruined my pregnancy by being vindictive & self righteous - warning: long story,Royal_Juice2987,"Warning: very long story and I don’t have the energy to summarise after writing it all out, but any advice appreciated if you can be bothered reading. Thanks. 

I (34F) am currently 35 weeks pregnant (May-25). This is my first baby and I am pregnant with a baby girl. My sister (31) has been my closest friend my entire life but we are completely different personalities. 

As a child I was very outgoing and confident, whereas as an adult I suffer with generalised anxiety and have had some low levels of depression on and off throughout my adult life. I am an empath and think and feel quite deeply. My sister was very shy as a child but has grown up to be a little more outgoing, although I don’t think she is as emotionally deep as me - she has never experienced anxiety and almost dismisses mental health problems generally. I’d say she thinks that good mental health is a choice and can be controlled easily. 

For reference we have a narcissistic mother, a passive emotionally avoidant father and there has been lots of dysfunction in our family and triangulation from my mother in the past. I think it’s fair to say we have both picked up some horrendous communication habits from our parents. We have never been taught good communication or healthy resolution. 

Admittedly, I am emotional and see red quite quickly often saying things that whilst are very real to me and 100% relate to what I am feeling and experiencing, aren’t always helpful. My sister on the other hand avoids conflict but is also extremely snappy, sulky, stroppy and can be very vindictive. If you cross her at all, she storms off in a bad mood and can give you the silent treatment for as long as she feels fit, and it seems she feels absolutely nothing. 

My sister was pregnant a couple of years ago and I had to be at her beck and call every single day to listen to her pregnancy woes, and I was always on the other end of the phone to cheer her up on a bad day. This continued into my niece arriving - I have been obsessed with her ever since, feel deep deep love for her and have spent a lot of time with her since she was born. 

Back in February, sort of mid-late second trimester my sister carefully broke it to me that she was looking to book a holiday around my due date. I was gutted - she is the only family I really have. My mother is so toxic I can’t bear her being near me. She emotionally abused me for years and I can’t stand the thought of her near me or my daughter and my dad never even said congratulations to me, because he’s too wrapped up in my mums commands. This has been a theme throughout his entire relationship with her - he’s isolated from his own family, he has no friends, has even seen off his business partner and he acts like he doesn’t even have a brain of his own anymore. 

My sister was trying to sell going away to me as ‘leaving me in my bubble’. This felt weird because her birth was very adverse, emergency c section and a stay in hospital with her little girl - to which I responded to her every whim to make sure she was cared for. Running extra clothes and snacks to the hospital (all the while not being allowed in to see her or the baby, which was fine)… and running out to buy some preemie clothing for the baby when she came home as she was so small nothing fit. 

My anxiety took me straight to a place where I would need a family member in a similar capacity and she wouldn’t even be in the country. I know you can’t control people’s lives but this stings because I would never book a trip within a month of her due date. I care too much, and this wouldn’t even be a worry she would have to think about. 

I left it a couple of days and felt stressed. My partner told me to speak to her. I approached it very gently but it quickly turned sour. She’s a SAHM and her husband pays for them both to live, earns an extremely good salary and they are very very well off financially. She played the card “ask him, because he’s not willing to pay hundreds of pounds more to go away weeks after because it’s school holidays and it gets expensive”. This pissed me off because 2 years ago she coughed up over £1000 just to go on a hen do for one of her friends (his money/their money) and he wasn’t even going. 

I didn’t say this to her, but I feel like her husband digs his heels in when it’s anything to do with her family because he only prioritises his own and they’re always seemingly in competition with who’s family gets more time with them and their child etc, which I find very weird. I did tell her that this was ‘tight fisted’ and that I didn’t feel a few hundred pounds warranted missing the birth of your first niece (no other kids in the family apart from hers), and to not be around for me post-partum for a short while. I say this knowing I 100% did this for her, and if anything it felt like an honour. 

Prior to these messages, when she was trying to sell to me ‘being in my bubble’ as in her not being here ‘in my way’, she recited a conversation between her and her husband where they’d been discussing my due date and how she couldn’t possibly miss the birth and she said to her husband “I know my sister, she’s not having a very nice pregnancy and she won’t go overdue, she will just go to the hospital and get induced”. I didn’t say anything at the time but this really upset me because induction is the last thing I’d ever want and I’ve expressed this before… but seemingly doesn’t listen and just wanted to make sure my pregnancy fit in with her plans of a summer holiday abroad. 

I’m getting annoyed just reliving all of this right now to be honest. Anyway, moving on - she snapped on the texts and said “oh fuck off, I won’t be there at all at this rate” which really hurt me. She knows that’s what I needed and she went from seemingly caring to switching completely when things weren’t going her way. I told her she was a poisonous cow and there were a few irrelevant lines exchanged after that then it stopped. This was 3pm and I was waiting for a reply. 8pm I noticed she blocked me on WhatsApp. She’s never done this before, this is also the first argument we’d had in 18 months. 

I cried my eyes out to my husband night saying she didn’t care and that there are a completely different set of rules and expectations for us as sisters. I work from home and the next day I was so exhausted from crying all night and not sleeping that I rang in sick and I just slept on and off all day with my curtains drawn and felt so shit. 

My husband who would never ever normally get involved, called my sister to speak to her that morning. He is honestly so polite and tries to be impartial at all times. He told her I’m not having a good time, he was worried about me, I didn’t feel like I had any family etc and she seemed to get a bit upset herself. He suggested we take a day or a few away from each other and without saying it directly, suggested she reach out when we had cooled off. 

4 weeks passed, still blocked. Her husband invited my husband to do a marathon training run together, they did and when her husband dropped mine off at home in the car he raised the row. My husband said I was blocked and that sent a message in itself. Another 2 weeks passed then she unblocked me - seemingly waiting for me to make the first move. I’d be happy to do this, but in my experience my sister is NEVER over an argument and if you approach her at any point afterwards, it is just another opportunity to drag you over hot coals again. She literally is so pissy and difficult to talk to without her forcing an apology out of you, even if she had a huge part to play in the issue. 

After she unblocked me another 6 weeks passed. 3 months she’s avoided me for during my pregnancy - this is something she would 100% have disowned me for if I did to her. I’d never be allowed to forget it - my life actually wouldn’t be worth living. 

This weekend just gone, her husband had been pressing my husband all week to meet him for a drink. They met at a pub for a few hours, had a few drinks and he was basically saying that I needed to reach out and apologise for calling my sister poisonous and calling them tight fisted. Basically insinuating I’d be giving birth and not having them involved in my child’s life if I didn’t grovel? My husband is super polite but he told me after a few drinks he lost his temper a bit and said “there is absolutely no way I am going home to my pregnant wife, who is about to give birth in a matter of weeks, and telling her she needs to apologise for this mess”… and he basically said it’s not going to get resolved then because my sister wasn’t willing to reach out. My husband also said he got the impression that my sister had fully considered the long term effects of this. 

My husband also said that her husband said my sister was actually growing increasingly annoyed about me not reaching out, because I hadn’t seen my niece in 3 months. May I repeat that my sister is the most unapproachable person when she’s in a bad mood, and this is the longest she’s ever gone without talking to me, and I already had the impression she was using my niece as bait to make me come running to her, despite feeling like she has abandoned me first by booking a holiday when I’m due and secondly by being absent for half of my pregnancy and certainly during the darkest time of it when I felt really low and poorly.  

My husband came home, we talked, I cried and we said we needed to just accept they weren’t going to be around at all when I gave birth and that they weren’t too bothered about it, therefore we should stop worrying about it. Side note: we have our suitcases stored in their loft until we have ours boarded out and I need one for my hospital bag (genuinely been a concern for a while now). So I said to my husband, I’m not willing to hang on a few weeks and then ask to collect them because it will drag everything up again and it will look like we’re trying to start a conversation about it again. So my husband asked her husband if he could collect them next week, he said yes…

Then later in the evening he said “what if I spoke to [my sister] and got her to call tonight” and my husband asked me how I’d feel. I said I was fine with it. He then replied again saying “she’s going to need some more convincing” plus their daughter was poorly and they had their hands full that night, plus my sister had a part time job application to fill before Friday so she was busy. It’s now early hours Saturday and she’s not called. 

If I know my sister, she will be going through the last WhatsApp chat with a fine tooth comb to find anything she can trip me up on, to blame this on me. She keeps the receipts for absolutely everything. I’m nervous to talk to her because she will beat me with the stick I hand to her basically. If I tell her I felt low and heartbroken when she cut me off, she will use it against me. If I act calm and nonchalant she will tell me I don’t care and I’ve just caused trouble and it hasn’t even affected me. 

She is extremely extremely sensitive to words and I know she’s after an apology for the poisonous and tight fisted comments. Whereas it wouldn’t shock me if she then didn’t apologise for any of the above. Every argument is about winning and dishing out maximum punishment for anyone who dare cross her. 

I should add that in the last message from her husband, he said “She’s dropping a shit load of pride to reach out”. My husbands jaw dropped. I know my husband has seen a different side to them both in this argument and we’ve agreed that if we sort things out for the sake of our kids etc then we will be giving them a much wider berth. 

My sister has always been beyond sensitive when it comes to any kind of feedback / conflict / confrontation… but her husband who she’s been with since she was 17 is the same and they make each other worse - sitting at home plotting and validating each others reactions. 

I feel so sick with myself for all of the stuff I’ve done for her over the years. I’ve had crushing pain in my chest all night knowing that I could be having a conversation with her this weekend where I’ll probably go to pot and won’t get anything across in my defence. 

This has ruined most of my pregnancy. I’ve thought about it every day since it happened and I’ve not been able to escape it. We live in the same small town and I’ve been terrified of bumping into her in our local town centre for months. She’s really let me down, I actually don’t know if I can fully forgive her but also if I tell her things won’t be the same, and we need a healthier distance between us because we’re so different then she will flip it and say “well what’s the point of talking about this if we’re not going to go back to the way things were?”. 

I can’t do it to myself - this one sided relationship anymore. What would you do?",3,7,1747448298.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1koi83a/my_sister_has_ruined_my_pregnancy_by_being/

And before you say what about times you get to join them, then it's often just to show face so the public have a good opinion of how the parents treats the 2 siblings equally. When in fact they'd even sometimes be willing in the most serious cases be willing to even have the unfavored child like donate an organ to save the favorite child.

1koe0i8,My Sister is Moving to the US Later This Year,Lucas5440,"Not sure if this is appropriate sub for such a thing, but it's the closest I can find.  

Bit of a background, my sister and me are close and have always gotten along well, there's a 13 year age gap between us and she's always seen me as her baby brother even though I'm sadly into my 30s now. My brother in law has been given a crazy work opportunity in the States, and they've decided to take the offer and move there (we're from England). 

It would be a big enough loss with just the two of them moving, but the real pain for me comes from that my nieces will also be moving with them. Little bit more back story about my niece's, I'm not a Christmas and birthday only uncle, I've been involved in their lives from day one and have always had a bond with them. Not just because they're my family they're the sweetest girls and have fantastic personalities, one is about to be a teenager in a few months and the younger one is 10. 

I have an amazing partner who also has a very close bond with my nieces and is just as wounded by the news as I was. My brother in law told us this was happening August of last year and are being held up by the visa process, it definitely seems like it will still be this year that they leave. 

The reason I'm posting here, is because I'm at a loss, I have been ever since being told the news, I don't know if depressed is the right term, but I know I'm fucking devastated, the fact the girls are leaving is often my first thought when I wake up and my last when I fall asleep. I've spoken at length about it with my partner about how to deal with it and how it makes us feel, and nothing has helped, it's like a dull thud at the back of my mind and feels like it's always just below the surface. 

Thankfully it's East coast and not West, so it's closer to England than the West coast. I was wondering if anyone on this sub has any similar experiences to this and if they found a way to cope with the loss, because from my perspective when they get on the that plane and if they stay there I miss the majority of the rest of their lives. I can't imagine them not being in my life as they are now but I know there's no avoiding it. Any advice from anyone going through or been through the same would be greatly appreciated.

she's always sensed when people are afraid of her, not the first time she is barking in these cases.

anyways, family evaluating if we should pay for them staying at a hotel, to circumvent the issue, (2 weeks duration) but I dont want to pay for that.

before you criticize me for being a stingy b\*stard, hear me out.

getting a dog is a serious serious commitment, we had one in childhood, but sold him because we were too lazy to attend to his needs, just kids after all, no backyard for him to roam free.  
so I knew how big such commitment is,  
so in early 20s my father comes home with this puppy, complete surprise, everyone all ""aww how cute"" n shit, but my mind blank, ""did they forget what owning a dog means? at least going out with it everyday for 20 minutes for its whole lifetime, having to restructure your day to do that regularly.  
I voiced my criticism and they agreed that I wouldnt have to have that responsibilty.  
years passed, they still nudged me to watch her when they went on vacations and trips (I'm that kind of home enjoyer anyways more than the travel guy, but their expectation of me still annoyed me).

so now they're asking the 1 guy in the family who doesnt have any responsibility for the dog to also pay up, even though it is their fault for not raising her properly, she always barks at the littlest things: people walking outside, doorbell, sounds, strangers, visitors...  
and dont tell me you cant do sth about that stuff, pretty sure you can, watched that guy on tv teach the most brutal looking beasts, you know who.

so thats my view, what do you guys think, probably really boring situation compared to other stuff on this thread, so no one probably read so far",1,7,1747429431.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kobt49/my_grandparents_are_coming_to_us_to_attend/

1ko04h0,"After 24 Years of Silence and Pain, My Mom Is Finally Standing Up for Us",IllustriousMiddle622,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something personal because I know many people are dealing with toxic and abusive family situations, and it can feel so isolating.

My dad has been a toxic, manipulative, abusive, controlling, and obsessive husband toward my mom for as long as I can remember. He’s never supported us financially — everything came from my aunt and his parents. My mom got pregnant at 17, and they married young. Mom never finished high school, but my dad did.

Growing up, our home was full of trauma — my parents fought constantly, sometimes violently. My dad was not only violent toward my mom, but also physically and emotionally abusive toward me. When I was a kid, he told me he wished I was aborted. Those words haunted me for years, making me question my worth and pushing me into dark, suicidal thoughts.

I remember my mom leaving us and hiding for months because my dad physically hurt her. She even went to the police, but my grandparents begged her not to press charges. She was always alone. Because of my dad’s behavior, mom lost contact with her own family for years — my dad had a fight with them, and he would break her phone anytime she tried to reach out. Mom worked multiple jobs just to keep us afloat, even when my dad’s family sent money.

I saw so much pain growing up. My parents were toxic to each other — and immature — and they kept going back and forth, which made everything harder for me.

Now, I’m about to graduate college. This week, my parents finally decided to separate after my dad threatened to kill us. We had to move out urgently — I paid the rent this month from my savings just to get us to safety. Even after the separation, he stalked my mom at her workplace and harassed her coworkers to find our new address. Thankfully, they protected us by keeping quiet. Mom didn’t go to work today — she started filing a VAWC case (Violence Against Women and Children), and I’m hoping and praying for justice and peace for her.

After 24 years of marriage, my mom finally decided to fight back.

I’m so incredibly proud of her. Despite everything — the abuse, the isolation, the constant struggle — she never gave up on us. She worked tirelessly, often juggling multiple jobs, just to provide for me and keep me safe. Her strength, resilience, and love inspire me every day.

To anyone out there who is trapped in a toxic or abusive situation: You are not alone. It’s not your fault. It’s okay to ask for help. It’s okay to fight for your safety and your peace of mind.

We deserve love, respect, and safety. Every day is a battle, but healing starts with courage and taking one step forward.

Thank you for reading my story. I’m holding onto hope — for me, for my mom, and for anyone who needs it.",8,1,1747400060.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ko04h0/after_24_years_of_silence_and_pain_my_mom_is/

My brother he has extreme anger issues and does the same but unlike my dad the marijuana barely tempers it. Me i have it also but rather than getting high Miss spend a lot of time getting my anger out through writing, doing violent photography, and running extremely violent tabletop games. 

Now my gf wants to have a baby. I see that the anger issues passed on to my sister's sons. One of them is nearly ended up in jail multiple times. The other one learn to channel it into building things. 

I worry about if we have kids I'll pass that and go on to them. 

It also doesn't help that the men in my family are irrationally strong. I don't work out but I can deadlift over 400 lb My brother who works out moderately can lift even more than that before he blew his back out.

1knt8rj,My (19F) mom (38F) is clinically depressed and upset I can't center my life around her the way she has my whole life.,New-Bell4222,"Some backstory- My mom had me when she was 19. She always told me that she prayed that someone would love her unconditionally, and when she got unexpectedly pregnant while she was nowhere near ready, it was God sending me to her so she would have someone that would ""love her no matter what"". She was married to my brother's dad for a while, and then they split up and since then we have lived in a number of different states and she has had a number of different boyfriends, none staying super long. My mom and I always had a rocky relationship, as she refuses to get help for mental issues that make her borderline narcissistic, but I always reminded myself that if I just got to 18, I could go to college and the distance would make it easier and better for both of us. A few years ago my aunt, who my mother had always been extremely close to, died out of the blue at a fairly young age. Ever since then my mom hasn't been the same. She's constantly depressed, she doesn't like doing the things she used to, and she's developed this mentality that the universe is punishing her for something and everyone always leaves her. (All things that I understand come with grieving- the issue is that she refuses to get help.)

That brings us to August of this past year. I decided to go to a college about 3 hours from home, and I come back from school semi-regularly, about once every two months, but sometimes more. I have been dating my current boyfriend for a year, and we are long distance since he goes to college 7 hours away from our home town. I see my boyfriend and hang out with my friends at home a lot, as this is the first time I've had a real friend group because of all the moving throughout middle and high school. My mom, since I left for school, has been constantly more depressed and begging me to come home. I once asked her if she just thought I was going to live at home forever, and she responded with a genuinely upset ""Yes."" Earlier this week, she came into my room to say goodnight and was visibly upset. I asked what was wrong and she started crying and said she felt like she died when my aunt did and that she just doesn't want to or feel motivated to do anything anymore, all signs of textbook depression, which I also have and am medicated for. She then went on to say that she's upset that my boyfriend comes before her, and one day I'm going to have my own family (as if it was a bad thing that I may have my own family one day). I told her he does not come before her, and she said he does. She mentioned the other day when she had to make the hour drive to my grandmother's house at 6AM and was upset I didn't come knowing that my boyfriend had slept over the night before and we were out with friends until 1AM. I said I was sorry and I felt bad, but one day I will have my own family and I hope she'd be happy and want that for me, and of course I'd still want to see her and have her be a part of my life. 

I just want to help her stop feeling like this and I don't know how to. It's weighing on me so heavily and everything I do without her makes me have this pit in my chest and intense guilt for wanting to have a life separate from her, because her life has revolved around me since I was born.

1knrpwy,Is this sibling abuse or rivalry?,Agreeable-Guide-6181,"Hello, I wanted to post on here about a complicated situation Im dealing with. I am a young woman, with 3 older sisters. One of my oldest sisters I’ve had problems with for a long time. To give some backstory, her and I grew up with with a father who would physically and emotionally harm us.  Neither of us speak to him anymore, but we are still greatly affected. This sister, who I’ll call Amy, has always reached out to me about stuff going on in her life. But it started to go downhill about 4 years ago, I was 17 years old and she’d talk to me about relationship issues and her and her partner’s sex life. That’s when I started to realize that I was becoming uncomfortable. I would try to be empathetic and understanding, but it was slowly draining me and poorly affecting my life. This behavior continued for a long time, Amy and her partner would fight, and she’d come to me, I’d offer advice and she wouldn’t do anything with it, just allowed it to continue. That’s what leads us to today, she messaged me about another issue again, and that’s when I realized this needs to stop. This happened on a Sunday night right before an important event I had the next day, and I didn’t reply. So I sent her a paragraph stating I was no longer going to put up with the behavior anymore, that I no longer wanted to be contacted about issues. I’ll include messages below that occurred over a couple days.

I just feel emotionally drained and sad that it had to be this way. But I wanted to share it here. I ended up going no contact, cause I realized my feelings never mattered to her, and that it’s better this way for my own peace. ",8,17,1747367929.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knrpwy
1knqmze,My quarrel with brother stretched on forever.,Unhappy_Garbage_1391,"I loved my brother very much until I was 14. He has always been my favorite because I have two brothers. From 2019 to 2022, he dated a wonderful girl, let's call her Katya. Katya had a university degree and knew two foreign languages, she was spiritually developed and, in general, was a very interesting conversationalist. We immediately found contact with her. I really liked her! But brother did not propose to her, although the girl, as it turned out later, was already about 27 years old at the time (he lied that she was five years younger, as it turned out later), and she was very worried about it. She began to ask him about it often, and then instead of proposing, brother broke up with her. Besides, at that moment he had a friend living with whom they went to clubs and drank. Katya didn't like it very much. And at the same time, a friend also said that Katya was bad and they should break up. It was very difficult for Katya to break up - she really loved him and still hasn't found anyone (3 years later). Meanwhile, my brother wasn't particularly sad. A month later, he saw a girl with a friend in a cafe, and they began to argue over whose she would be. That girl (let's call her Anna) has absolutely nothing - she graduated from high school and worked in a cafe. She was also a so-called ""model"" and skillfully made faces in front of the camera, dreaming of finding a richer groom. And my brother bought it. He's been chasing her for six months (he has his own business and he's pretty cute). At that time, he had completely forgotten about his family. He came once a week for an hour, during which he ate and slept. It hurt me a lot. That was the first time we had a fight over his madam, so I saw his message out of the corner of my eye and quoted it to him, in response to which he read my correspondence. He was gradually leaving the family that had given him everything-education, business, car, apartment. I especially feel sorry for my mother, who also had a negative opinion of Anna. He often began to forget about what his parents had given him. My brother stopped helping the family and interacting somehow. And so he paid for Anna's trip to Thailand. When they left, she never posted a photo where she wrote about my brother. It felt like she was completely self-sufficient and independent. The extreme point was that she posted a video where she tried on if san laran shoes. After a long day at work, I said this to my brother when he was still in Thailand, which he almost sent me to. It turned out that he wanted to propose to her there. But I found out about it later. My brother has completely stopped communicating with me. When he came home after the trip and I mentioned it again, he asked, ""How could you even say that? What if she had heard?"" I replied that I didn't care because she was just another whore. He invited me to go and tell her to her face, to which I showed him the fax. We didn't talk anymore. Although he tried to establish contact, I made it a condition for him that he should apologize (he still hasn't done that) . I wasn't willing to just forget it. I began to find erotic shots of his girlfriend, shots in lingerie. They showed it to him, and he said we were bad because we were showing it to him. I just saw a video in her reposts that she wants a Porsche. She made me sick. At some point, brother proposed to her. I hated them. The whole family asks me to communicate with him, but he doesn't want to get back at me because he doesn't know why. In the summer of 2024, they traveled in different cars from the city. She went first (brother gave her mom's car to use). And then the fact came to light that she had two men living with whom she was cheating on my brother at the same time. They'll only be apart for two weeks. I was hoping my brother would come to his senses. Later, we began to communicate with Katya. It turned out that brother had told her that all this time he had been contacting an astrologer, who told him to break up with Katya. And Anna, in his opinion, did not cheat on brother. As it turned out, he was strict with her in choosing clothes, even though his new girlfriend dresses according to her name. He absolutely stopped helping the family, only in rare cases. He even deliberately left the gym where I study, just not to cross paths. His social circle (Anna's girlfriends) are just as dumb. And if I talked to any of them, then all the information immediately went to them. We still don't communicate. Am I an asshole if I don't want to communicate without discussing this situation? He still didn't understand why he was guilty in front of me. I don't think he even tried to devote time to this issue.",1,0,1747364395.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1knqmze/my_quarrel_with_brother_stretched_on_forever/
1knooz7,My dad told me to take my uncle looking at me inappropriately as a compliment and to stop being dramatic,Anime_lover_0910,"Hi reddit 
A few weeks ago I, 15 F, was with my dad,43 M, at a grocery store parking lot after running into my aunt and uncle who are in they're late 20s (I don't know exact ages)
I was wearing a pair of shorts and one of my dad's shirts and I was talking to my nephew  (as much as you can talk to a two year old) who was in his car seat when I turned around and caught my uncle staring at me looking me up and down like a creep. I was obviously uncomfortable and moved a bit so I was slightly behind my dad and aunt and out of his line of sight. After about ten minutes they left and me and my dad walked into the store, my dad telling me about barbacue plans he had made with my aunt and uncle. I immediately stopped and told him I wouldn't go and told him about my uncle staring at me and how he made me feel uncomfortable ( Him staring at me is a reoccurring thing and he's tried to touch me once but my boyfriend saw and shut that down immediately). My dad rolled his eyes and told me I need to stop taking it wrong and my uncle staring at me was a compliment, I need to stop being over dramatic and that if they have a barbecue I will be going. I told him I wouldn't and if he made me I would sit in his truck with the doors locked because that is the only way I'd feel safe around that uncle. He didn't say anything to me after that and was talking under his breath for the rest of the night. Im very hurt that my dad told me those things especially because he's caught my uncle looking at me like that before. I don't know what to do as I don't trust my dad anymore and feel like if anything happens with this uncle my dad won't believe me. Please can anyone tell me what to do from here because I am lost and hurt and don't know what to do. 

(Edit) I have tried to tell my aunt about it but she won't believe me but my other aunt and her husband do and keep me away from the pervy uncle. The last time I tried to tell someone about something like this it ended up with me being assaulted by the person who made me uncomfortable and nobody believed me that it happened so I'm going to be carrying pepper spray and things to protect myself while around him.

1knnfd7,I cannot stand my grandmother (Long story),Substantial_Fee2114,"I was raised by my grandparents. I was more close with my grandfather than my grandmother. My uncle was an abusive raging alcoholic who abused us all. Not only that but he was a pathological liar. He’s always lived with us. Never had a job. He stole money and belongings from my grandparents. He’s over 44 mind you. He would get drunk and try to fight my grandfather. Then he started fighting me and my two brothers. We were all minors at the time. My grandfather always kicked him out. But my grandmother would threaten to take her own life, leave my grandfather, and never talk to my grandfather again if he didn’t let my uncle back in the house. My uncle has physically beating my younger brother who was only 15. My grandmother begged my brother not to report my uncle. Of course we all thought my grandmother was just the sweetest old lady ever. After my grandfather died I realized how terrible my grandmother really was. She always talked bad about my grandfather even though he was providing for her and her son. After my grandfather passed, when we were getting ready for his funeral my uncle kicked my brother out. My grandmother didn’t care. She didn’t even say anything. I yelled at him and I told him to get out. My grandmother kicked me out instead. My brother had to sleep in his car because of this man. He doesn’t even own the house. My uncle had kissed my neck when I was 15. He has stared at my legs and other body parts. I have told my grandmother this she didn’t care. He was watching porn in the living room and jerking off. Where anyone could walk out and see him. She didn’t believe us then either. He fought my little brother again and my grandmother once again threatened to kill herself if we reported him. The last time I let this slide was when he argued with my brother and threw a lit cigarette in his face and fought him. I got so angry I grabbed a bat and threatened to beat him if he came back. He broke our windows and tried to come in. He was sent to jail and my brother got a restraining order. He keeps coming here in the middle of the night and talks to my grandmother. My grandmother enables this man so much and she’s deadass evil. She is a manipulator and has always been. I cannot stand her and I resent her for how badly she treated my grandfather. When my grandfather was near death he had stated he doesn’t want to deal with my uncle for the remainder of his days. There goes my grandmother again! Saying she will leave him if he kicks him out!

1knm8y7,I got told my mom cheated on my dad after years of me not knowing,fatkittycat422,"The title kinda says the issue. My parents started to separate when I was in 5th-6th grade but nothing was finalized until years later (until 9th grade-ish). I am 23 now and I have never knew why my parents separated, but I do kinda know that my mom did cheat on my dad with my now stepdad when I was in middle school. I have put that behind me and fully processed that info. I also never knew or really wanted to know why they separated/ the full story. I knew that I would not be able to really understand or be able to handle the reason. Well I find out today that my mom actually cheated on my dad when I was MUCH younger, I was probably 7-8ish? I think. 

It also wasn’t the best way to find out. I found out at work on the 3rd day of my new job, after I opened my laptop and saw a text from my sister. My sister and I are not speaking to each other (that’s a wholeeee other issue I do not want to go into), but I blocked her number a few days ago on my phone, but if she sent me texts then I still got them on my laptop. In a fit of her rage, she sent me a text explaining my mom cheated on my dad with a man we (my family) were friends with for a few years. I would go over to his house and would play with his kids. He was friends with another close family friend of ours and now I’m wondering if they knew. I don’t really know how to feel. It would’ve happened back in 2009-2010ish, so there’s nothing I can do about it now. The part that hurts the worst is that I am VERY close with my mom. I talk to her everyday and she is truly my best friend. I never understood why my sister hated my mom or resented her and it makes sense now. My dad and I aren’t super close (that’s another story), but we still talk often and he knows I didn’t want to know anything about the divorce. I want to talk to someone about this, but I don’t know who.

1kniz6a,Do they really care about my sister more then me,everything_is_shit1,"So my 18 year old sister Amy (not real name) her birthday is 2 days before mine (I'm 19) growing up on birthdays we always wanted the same things, so her birthday being 2 days before she would always get to open her presents in front of me so I knew what I was getting but wasn't allowed it for 2 days.
And similar with birthday cakes she will always get a big one and I would get a tiny one even for my 16th and 18th she got the big cake and I got a small one because ""everyone was full from her cake so wouldn't eat mine"".
I don't want to sound ungrateful i have always smiled and been appreciative of what I've gotten but this year I was asking what the plans were for our birthdays and my mum said we were going out for dinner on Amy's night for her birthday. Normally we'd go to a restaurant on both nights but this year she told me we won't be going out for mine because it's a Monday and everyone's working, it upset me a bit that she didn't say we could go the next weekend she's just decided we won't go at all for mine.
I already hate my birthday and this is just adding to it, they don't know how much I hate my birthday. Every year since I can remember it has always been about Amy because hers is first even my 18th I got £100 from all family members put together whilst Amy got a car, driving lessons and a lot of money, again im was very grateful for what i did get.
I'm just noticing now how unfair the treatment is between us. Amy went to do A levels whilst I went to work, once I turned 17 I got 3 driving lessons and got to drive the family car for practice once a week sometimes not even that and it was only a 10 minuet drive to shops and back. Amy got 10 lessons paid for, the family car and was practicing 4 to 5 times a week.
So when Amy passed her driving test she got to keep the family car whilst I had to buy my own, she has now had the car for a year like I did but she gets to keep it and not have to buy her own like I did, is this unfair or am I reading to much into it?
Anyway like I said i hate my birthday and my mum always points out everything I do wrong and I never get a well done for everything I've done for myself whilst any does nothing and gets all the praise. So does it look like they favour her over me?",2,2,1747342127.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kniz6a/do_they_really_care_about_my_sister_more_then_me/

1knadte,AITA that im upset my dad is trying to sell family heirlooms and isn't letting me buy one,GoldenPick1e,"I'm going to try my best to keep it short and quick. My dad (60m) and uncle are wanting to sell my Grandma's (dad's mum, deceased) jewlerry to help pay for my Grandpas care home payments as its so expensive. 
I (24f) am a little upset that they are doing this, as they are already selling his house thats on the market for more than £1m+ and said can't they use that money, rather than family heirlooms to fund it. My dad doesn't seem to understand at all and even if they did sell the expensive jewlerry, it's around £18k in value and would only really fund a few months in the home. 
I've asked to have him please send me photos of the jewlerrey they plan in selling and said I want to buy one to keep in my family one day. Whilst yes, I don't have the money now, I want to have to opportunity to save for one and keep as sentiment. I don't care for the value of what it's worth. 
He sent me photos of 3 items and said these are the only ones they're letting me available to me as they're on the 'cheaper' scale and can have for free but that isn't what I asked. Then he said they'll keep all the jewlerry for a few years to think about, but then backpeddled a few hours later.
My Grandpa's housekeeper financially abused him and took from him over £75k and they aren't even trying to fight that. He was writing a £1k cheque to her whilst he was in the hospital because she asked for money (my dad found it).

AITA for asking my dad to let me buy one of my Grandma's jewlery? I feel crazy and stupid for letting this take up my brain but I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I were to let it go.

Side note: there are 8 grandchildren, 3 are female. The 3 females (including me) got given what they called 'costume jewlerry' to share between us where some items were worth £300 ish. 
I also don't know if my other cousins know they are selling the jewlerry, so I'm asking my eldest male cousin what he thinks.
My Grandma's was also the centre of my artwork growing up. Whilst we lost her a very long time ago when I was young, i still feel very connected to that side of my family internally.

1kn2gw1,Family problems - really need advice,quietdepths,"I need some advice and don’t know whether I’m just being petty 

I have a cousin, she’s someone I saw like a sister especially because I’m an only child and anyway over the years a few times she suggested meeting on trips but whenever I ask her to follow up on details like where when etc she ignores me and instead deflects to something else weeks later as though that conversation never happened 

This has happened multiple times over the years, not just once and I’m at a point of frustration and I don’t get why she bothers with empty words that raise my hopes. What she does is usually ignore me and then mass send me photos of her kids weeks later and expect me to validate or something I don’t even get it 

Well last weekend I was abroad and I hadn’t bothered to tell her bcos I decided to stop keeping in touch, I just posted the photos 7 days ago on my social media and that very day she text me asking how I am bcos I think she saw the photos. I replied that I was abroad etc and asked how she is…. No reply. 7 days later no reply still. And instead randomly she send me this slide via instagram. Is it a dig at me ? I just don’t get it. I want to build real connection and have meaningful conversation or at least a conversation but she ignores and sends this. She always does this, usually when I text her she ignores and then weeks later will send something unrelated as if the previous convo never happened   

I’m trying to figure out what’s her purpose sending these and is it a dig ? Each slide is with different quotes, ive put the quotes in the slide below

1. “It’s not your job to accept me. It’s mine” 
2. “You don’t have to get it. I didn’t come here to be decoded. I came here to be free”
3. I’m not here to be understood. I’m here to be authentic 
4. Validation doesn’t live outside me. I am the source now
5. I don’t chase belonging. I belong to myself 
6. My energy speaks before I do 
7. I don’t perform anymore. I show up and let alignment do the rest 
8. I’m not here to fit your story. I write my own now 
9. I’m not for everyone and that’s the beauty of belonging to myself 
10. I stopped editing myself when I realised truth was the entire point 

^ these are the quotes on the slides she sent. And she didn’t just forward them she also included a message saying “man love this so much. Relates so much to me” which is unusual bcos she usually just forwards random stuff without including a message. 

It feels really sad for me bcos I actually have no family im close to - no one I can converse with or call up. And I wanted her to be like a sister but I just don’t feel like I’m anyone important to her so I step back and keep a distance from everyone 

What is she doing and is those slides a dig ? Is it me being crazy? ",1,0,1747294912.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kn2gw1/family_problems_really_need_advice/
1kmydaj,I don’t know if my sister is projecting her abuse onto me and if my family is being dismissive about it.,Average_TeaTalker,"I’m sorry, I don’t know how to start off a paragraph right now because I just ran away from home and only came back because I’d only cause more distress. I’m also very sorry if I’m not providing enough information and if my sentences lack punctuation.
My sister is in her thirties and I’m a teenager. Years ago my sister and her husband lived with his family but from what I’ve heard and been told they’ve been abusing her and caused her a lot of distress that she had to talk to her husband about moving out to distance herself from that house. Just last year or two years ago she moved in with us again and her husband came with us.
I would also like to say I have 4 other siblings. But most of them except my brother(I think) don’t get along well with her. I remember being a child and hearing what they’d say, and being surrounded by toxic environments. I was exposed to a lot as a child.
…Sorry, I’ll continue. After my sister moved in I was honestly very happy because she didn’t have to be surrounded by an abusive household anymore. She seemed better but I’ll admit she might need to pick herself up and get a job. There are some times her and our mom fight due to reasons in the past but I don’t think it happens to much. I go to school so I’m not part of it at least. I want to also add she has a big attitude and says a lot of things that have made me feel a little disturbed or sad. Many times I’d be called ungrateful or unappreciative but I dont know if I did anything wrong. I feel horrible. She constantly does this and the last time she said that I’ve become more appreciative and more grateful was when I told her about a dream I had where she had drowned and I tried to save her. I blamed myself and grieved over her death so badly I woke up with my chest aching. She does say some other things but I’m scared to go into details. I want to also say I feel very depressed and unable to do many things in my life. I’ve gone through tough times and I don’t want to put it into anyone. My sister and other siblings know, I was kind of forced to tell them what I could. My sister said, “You know. Me and you are (kind of) the same.” I don’t know what to compare and contrast here. Other than some instances we’ve had that might be the same I don’t know if I feel validated. I make characters and add back stories to them, I told her that some of my characters are inspired by people and are based off of what I learned or my experiences. Their stories ending in good or bad endings or to in a way help me see from different perspectives or… just to find comfort and create ambition for them so I can have my own ambition and continue a little longer. I felt happy to tell her because she seemed interested in the stories my friends and I make but I never shared anything about the characters. I told her and warned her it would be dark and in the middle of it she interrupted me and said how she feels uncomfortable that this character is based off of one of my friends and then made the story all about herself. Then used my two of my friends who’ve gone through abuse as an example. “What if he thinks this character is too similar to him that he feels bad and horrible and kills himself or if you never see him again.(?)” I want to say that I take inspiration from my friends but I don’t use their trauma in my character making. I take inspiration off of how I see them, either it’s charismatic, hardworking, beautiful, comforting, loving. I get it that from her perspective it’s concerning but they were made because of my experiences and to represent parts of myself or who I needed to be there with me in my life. I might’ve responded really angst that I just wanted to finish my characters story, she replied by saying “if finishing your characters story is more important than what I’ve told you about then I’m honestly disappointed in you.” It feels like I don’t have a voice when talking to her.
Just today it was raining really badly. She usually picks me up and she parked far. I had to walk through the rain and it was really cold. I don’t have the best body heat and I don’t want to make it an excuse. When I came into the car I just remember us starting small conversation. I didn’t respond with attitude but she says I did. I just said “You maybe could have parked closer.” And her response was, “At least you don’t have to walk in the rain.” It just felt like an in and off battle. I wasn’t saying it to be mean or show disrespect I just wanted to have fun. But then she got mad at me the second I started talking off my shoes and telling me how at least I didn’t have to walk in the rain. That I should be grateful for at least getting picked up and that atleast she was there. The told me that I’ve been having attitude. I asked her that I wasn’t show attitude yesterday or today and that— but she spoke louder and said “okay but even if you didn’t you could still be doing it without realizing it.” and that I’ve been having a problem with everything she has been doing that I should realize the way I’ve been treating her. She then brings up past incidents which made me feel so scared. I joke around a lot and add emotion in my voice because my friends laugh and find it funny and since for a long time I’ve been distant with my family I wanted to have that same amount of fun and replace those bad memories but she makes it out to be like I did something wrong. I feel like I did. After her rampage I cried in my room before leaving my glasses and running away from home into the rain with my phone. Half way on my walk I called a friend and cried to her about my sister. I was shaking and cold and vented to her about everything. I dont know what I did wrong and I dont know what I need to do for her. She calls me ungrateful and unappreciative all the time when I do something that makes it feel like I don’t care for others when I care so much about everyone. I can’t get my point across without her saying something first and cutting me off. When I know I didn’t show attitude in my voice she makes it seem like I did. A lot of my family does that. I try to talk but I feel so little when she raises her voice at me. She brings up past events that I feel horrible and feel like I did something wrong. That I need to work on myself because she said and pointed something out. My friend says it’s maybe guilt tripping but I don’t know. I don’t want to make her out to be a bad person when I know she’s gone through so much. I did continue with my rant, bringing up some things and some other things she did that I felt horrible for. What hurts me the most is when I show the slightest bit of emotion in my voice I get called unappreciative and ungrateful and that I lack consideration for others and always try to start a fight with everyone. Maybe some other things but I’m just scared. During my time under the storm shelter, bailing my eyes out, I got many calls and text from family but none from my sister who stared this. One of them told me to go home and ignore her but I didn’t want to face her. I know that you have to confront someone or face your fears but I couldn’t face her when I feel so vulnerable. My friend advised me to take it out on herself but Immediately declined and cried harder. After a while I got a text from a family friend who lives in our house and told me to come home and that he’ll have to lecture me. I didn’t want to go home but I didn’t want to get police and cause trouble anymore so I went home. When he talked to me it felt like they only acted more about my physical being and return rather than how I was mentally or emotionally. I felt unable to express and do anything because they wouldn’t understand no matter how hard I tried. I felt like giving up because I couldn’t take it and it was piling up on me.
After I got cleaned up I sat on the couch scrolling through tik tok trying to find ideas to draw or laughing stupidly at some videos to ease myself. My sister came and sat next to me and apologized but it didn’t feel like it was genuine. It hurt and I don’t understand why. I don’t fully remember because so cried shortly after she left but it was mostly about how she’s sorry that what she said affected and hurt me but— and stated some other things and about how I’ve been treating her. I don’t know how I’ve been treating her, I’m trying to think about it and I’m scared if I’m really an asshole in this situation. I laid down in my bed crying before trying to find something or anything to distract myself and pull myself away from darker thoughts until suddenly I stumbled on a video talking about verbal abuse. Suddenly the events of today and other times came crashing down on me and I started panicking. I don’t want to make my sister or anyone in my family out to be a bad guy. I looked deeper into it and searched up the following: “is calling someone ungreatful and unapreciative when they didnt do anything name calling”, “if you ran away from home and your family only cares about your saftey rather than your mental health what does that mean?”, “verbal abuse.”
The results made me think and now ins acted because I don’t want anyone in my family and for my sister to feel like a bad guy or the bad person but I want to tell them… but most of the time they don’t understand or they understand but they aren’t empathizing and trying to attempt. I feel like all the other times I’ve shown to be in distress or have been hurt by my sisters words it is dismissed because it’s how she acts or that she is a grown woman but she’ll be herself and learn eventually or it’s just how she is or something. I think back to the times as a child I didn’t understand why they talked bad about her sometimes and why they saw her as mean or bossy or have a lot of attitude. But today I feel like I just realized she’s been speaking very aggressively with me and that my family only cares more about me being present and not my mental state.
I don’t know. I just remeber watching a lot of Reddit stories and the OP’s being comforted or helped. I just want to know if I’m doing something wrong or if I need to do better for her and everyone so they don’t have to deal with me as much anymore. I want to understand if there is anything I can do to try and fix this or try talk to someone. But I’m scared.

1kmy2ry,Struggling to connect with my father despite loving and respecting him deeply,Fatasty_wrestler,"I'm 25 and finishing my master's in economics. From the outside, I seem like a successful person — especially in education. My father admires me a lot for that, and deep inside, I’ve developed a kind of pride about it — which I don’t feel good about. It makes me feel like I’m ""better"" than some others, which I know is not true.

My father is, in many ways, a strong person. He took responsibility for his entire family at 18, pulled them out of poverty, and now we're considered a wealthy family with a family business. He’s like a self-made man — a provider, but also extremely controlling.

The family expects me to help with the business, but the truth is: I *can’t*, at least mentally. Every time I try, something inside me hurts. The business is in bad shape, and I think everyone hopes I will ""fix"" it just because I’m educated — but I feel stuck, paralyzed.

I also feel like I can’t breathe around my father. Even when I try to make my own decisions, I feel like his shadow is watching or judging me. He tries to get closer to me these days — I think he’s going through hard times emotionally and health-wise, and he’s trying to rely on family — but I always pull away.

When he talks to me or tries to get intimate (emotionally), I feel fake. I try to respond with warmth, but deep down, I feel like I’m pretending. I don’t understand why I can’t connect with him. I’m usually talkative and open with others, but not with him.

What hurts the most is that we don’t have a real relationship. And I love him. I’m worried about him. He’s getting older and sick, and I know he’s trying to lean on me. But I don’t let him. It feels like shame.

Has anyone else experienced something similar — feeling blocked from connecting with a parent, even when you care deeply? How do you even begin to repair a relationship that feels emotionally distant and weighed down by control, guilt, and unspoken expectations?",1,0,1747278471.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kmy2ry/struggling_to_connect_with_my_father_despite/
1kmw4cx,I found out my grandparents abused my dad. It still hurts.,depressedpebbles73,"I (18F) am very close with my dad. 
My dad's parents, my grandparents, were my role models growing up. We would visit them several times a year. My grandmother would bake cookies from scratch, always oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip—and she always seemed happiest when we were in her kitchen. My grandfather would take us on his motorcycles and laugh as we watched History channel documentaries about Bigfoot and other silly stuff. 

My grandma didn’t just send birthday cards—she made handmade cards for every single holiday, even obscure ones you don't usually get cards for. She’d write sweet little notes inside just like you’d expect from the perfect grandma. I kept most of them in a box because they felt like little pieces of her.

I adored them. I genuinely looked up to them and wanted to grow up to be like them—kind, thoughtful, involved. They were the people I bragged about having in my life. I loved them so much, and for most of my life, I believed that love was simple, safe, and unquestioned.

But that changed. When I was 11 years old, my family and I flew to visit my mom's side of the family for Christmas. When we got back to the airport in our home state, we realized the battery had died. So we called my uncle who lived nearby and he picked us up. He dropped us off at my grandparents, who agreed to let us stay until we got the car fixed. It was an unexpected visit, but they were hospitable nonetheless. One night, I woke up late in the guest room to hear yelling. My dad got me up and told me to pack up, that we were leaving. I was confused, but I did so anyway. I carried my sleepy 6-year-old sibling in my arms as I walked out the front door just in time to see my grandfather screaming at my dad, calling him a b**stard and stupid in front of me. ""Hey, kids! Tell your stupid dad to get off my property!"" was his exact wording.

I don't really remember how I felt at the time. I was just confused probably. We left. My uncle came and drove us to a car rental place, which my dad had tried to avoid doing. We went home that night and that was that.

There was no explanation for this incident. We just didn't visit them anymore. We didn't talk about it. When my great-grandmother (my paternal grandmother's mom) passed away when I was 12, it hit me really hard, because I loved her dearly. I saw my grandparents at the funeral and avoided them because it felt weird. Even though I had no idea what had happened that night, there was this new air of tension that I couldn't shake. I was too busy grieving my great-grandmother who had just passed. It was the first funeral I'd ever gone to. My grandfather attempted to make amends with my dad at it, but nothing went anywhere. 

I didn't understand until a year later, when I was 13, and my dad sat me down and told me about his childhood. He carefully explained that his parents had verbally and physically abused him his entire childhood. They were cruel to both him and my uncle. Name-calling, religious guilt, ridicule, and outright bullying were among the things they endured. And it was bad. My dad suffered from what I had noticed, but had not realized, were PTSD symptoms my entire life. Even now, in his 50s, my father is sensitive to sudden noises. 

When he had kids, he made a conscious decision to try to rebuild some kind of relationship with his parents—so that we could have grandparents in our lives. But that night, the tension that had been building for over a decade finally broke, and the truth about who they really were came crashing down around us.

Honestly, I was heartbroken, and I still am. It was a strange situation to process. My dad was and still is my best friend. My favorite person in the whole world. He has really broken the cycle of abuse. He's the best father I could ask for and nothing like his parents. Finding out that he had been dealing with things I had no clue about was really confusing and frustrating. I wasn’t angry at him for not telling me sooner—I understood how difficult that choice must have been. From 13 to 14, I had other stuff going on, so I didn't really deal with what I was feeling about that situation. 

But the pain kept coming back when I least expected it. A few months after I found out, my dad and I were on a trip when his brother called to say their father was in the hospital and might be dying. My dad drove us to the hospital, and I stayed in the waiting room while he went to visit. He let me decide if I wanted to go. I said no. I was angry. I still am.

By 15, I started to really understand how much the “grandparent thing” hurt me. When seeing an 18-wheeler with their small town’s name on it made me start crying, it was a clear sign something was wrong. The people I loved and trusted most had betrayed me decades ago—and I had no idea. Every kind thing they did felt tainted. I had been loving people who had abused the most important person in my life. I can’t imagine the pain my dad might've felt hearing me say I wanted to be like them when I grew up.

My dad has genuinely made peace with it and healed in his own way and I am so proud of him. He has reminded me that he is okay, that he has processed the trauma of what happened to him. He doesn't care about his relationship with them. He knows what happened wasn't his fault. But this whole thing has impacted me in a way I didn't expect. I'm still processing the pain of this betrayal. It's a strange situation to find out what a family member did, but what happened didn't directly happen to you. I feel all this anger and betrayal and sadness. I can’t look at photos of me with them or think about their house without imagining my dad as a child—crying, scared, and alone. It taints all those memories, and it hurts a lot. It didn't even happen to me. What sucks is I don't know anyone else who's been through this. How do I move past this anger towards them? I hate that they weren't actually kind people. They were just as terrible as they were all those decades ago. My dad is okay, so why can't I be okay?

Having genuinely good grandparents was something I cherished and now every time I hear my friends or other people talk about their grandparents, I feel the burn of envy. I really wanted to have my grandparents at my graduation, at my wedding, etc. I wanted to have them there because they were important to me. They were in so many of my childhood memories. 

The pain has faded a bit over the years but, now at 18, I’m still processing my anger and trying to forgive them. 

I'm reminded of this because I received the news the other day that my grandfather is very ill and likely going to pass away soon. I feel nothing and I'm not ashamed of feeling nothing about it. I know damn well I'm not attending that funeral. 

I'm grieving the loss of how I used to know my grandparents. How they once were perceived by my child mind. This is whole situation is what I've been working through for the past 8 years. And it's painful. It really weighs on me and has been the source of so much anger and pain. It's hard to put into words really. I hate that I share blood with them. I hate that I'm always tied to them, no matter what. I know I'm not like them and I never will be. To put it plainly, I'm just sad. I don't miss them. I don't want to speak to them or see them ever again.

I've been to therapy and journaled and written unsent letters to them and everything, but it's still here. It didn't even happen to me, but it still hurts. 

So here I am, sharing this because I don’t really know how to process it all on my own. 

I just want to hear people’s thoughts or stories. Sometimes it helps just to know you’re not alone.

1kmr9qc,How to navigate strained relationship with sister who lacks consideration for others?,Broad_Recipe8966,"I (29f) am the second of four girls. We’re all very close including our mom (all are no contact with our father). My parents, younger sisters and I moved to a different state when I was a teenager and my older sister stayed because of her then boyfriend. A couple years later she ends up needing out because he’s become abusive. My husband (then boyfriend) and I moved her in, get her a car and a job, and let her live there for free while she gets on her feet. Six months later, she ends up moving back to where we’re from with one of her exs bestfriends and they end up together. Fast forward 5 years and she moves in with my mom and younger sisters because he’s also a druggie and becomes extremely abusive. This time she moves in with her kids (5&7 now, 3&5 at the time). She lived with my mother for free for almost a year before she got a job. She only applied for two jobs that first year. The first one was where I worked at the time (wfh and flex scheduling), and the second was where she ended up working (cleaning cabins). She refused to put her youngest in daycare while her oldest was in school because she didn’t want strangers watching them. Which I get, but you can’t be a single SAHM with no job. I suggested since she didn’t get hired where I worked to look for other WFH jobs and she just never looked (literally admits she never made a resume or looked). When she moved here, the kids were loud (not normal loud, angry screaming loud from living in an abusive house), had no boundaries, and were super emotional. It’s super clear to all of us they have PTSD. The oldest told me the day she moved down here they moved because “daddy hit mommy hard in the eye.” Well here we are two years later and she still has yet to do anything to help her kids. Their behavior has gotten so much worse. Her parenting style is letting them do what they want and if she needs them to do something she screams and they scream back. She never follows through and the only time they ever actually end up listening is just if they have less willpower than her at the time. She has told em before she just caves all the time because she would prefer to give them what they want instead of listen to them whine and cry. We’ve all told her the kids severely need therapy. They’re book smart but socially and emotionally super delayed and we’re pretty sure it’s because they have CPTSD. She is around other children too and has admitted her kids have tantrums that are on par with a 2-3 year old instead of 5&7 year old. So she knows it’s not normal behavior, yet she still isn’t doing anything to help them, either at home or getting them in therapy. She also doesn’t take the time to teach them anything because it’s easier to do it herself so her youngest is five and still unable to dress herself, brush her teeth, wash herself and other things most kids can at least do with supervision or little help. It’s to the point our mother, other sisters and I all feel like it’s neglectful. The thing is, their behavior is starting to have an impact on the rest of the family. No one wants to be around her and her kids because every time they’re around it turns into a screaming match between her and her kids that’s so loud you can’t have a conversation in the same house as them. Her kids do have meltdowns and such other toddler like behavior when my sister isn’t around, but it’s not as bad without her because they don’t scream at everyone and we usually try and help them process their emotions instead of screaming at them for having them. Here’s where I’m asking for help; how do you navigate this kind of relationship? When she’s around with her kids she makes absolutely all of us miserable. We always hung out as a family once or twice a week and it’s down to about once a month now because no one wants to get together and listen to their screaming match. 

To add to this, she also has picked up a lot of toxic traits from being in abusive relationships for over a decade. She is very manipulative and judgmental. She is the oldest and regularly makes remarks about my sisters partners, who are amazing to them, simply because she’s jealous that they’re so young and are married and engaged. She makes comments all the time that I don’t let my kid watch tv at home and that cloth diapering is a waste of time. She makes comments about me being spoiled simply because of my husband treating me well and sharing in his part of taking care of the house, kids and cooking. She complains about my youngest sister not holding a job because of her BPD even though she still only works part time after two years since she got out of her relationship. She now lives with her new boyfriend and before they moved in with Him, she would regularly leave her kids at home with my mom and sisters while she went to his house without even letting them know she was gone. She regularly takes advantage of us when she gets a chance, she’ll ask for us to babysit so they can go on a date night, motorcycle ride, get a new tattoo or whatever but she won’t ask us for help watching her kids so she can get a regular job. I understand she’s still probably processing years of trauma, but it’s really hard to want to maintain a relationship with someone who makes you miserable and takes advantage of you when they’re not making any effort to better their life and neglecting their children’s mental and emotional wellbeing.

1kmqlpx,I am fearing for my life because my mother is strictly watching on all of my actions.,Alarmed_Ad_5916,"My mom did not deny her promise that she would put a record of my good and bad actions in a calendar. I feel like I am going to hold a lifetime record of my good and bad actions. Actually, she told me that she wrote my name on the calendar in our family's business store. My mom also mentioned that she and my half-sister had an agreement to make the calendar about me. She would put a red mark (when I do something bad) and a blue or green mark (when i did not do something bad). The reason why I assumed that what she had promised happened, it is because when I convinced my mom to not do it because I will make sure to stop commiting mistakes, she said that she will still do it. Because of what she did, she is kinda shaming me to my family members and the people who sees it.

And now, my backup plan is to do the same but it will have a different concept. Mine would be listing the negative and positive actioms of the people around me (especially my family, friends and the people I know) on a planner and write a summary about it every day. And when the year ends, I will write a narrative about everything I listed in my planner in all the days of the year. That way, I will enhance my talent in writing a true to life narrative. 

I think I am the only one who sees this but what she did to me kinda involves parent's favoritism. She told me that if my sister does something wrong, she would do the same but it feels like she will not do it because if I am basing it on her actions, she focuses on my mistakes more.

I know that I also did something bad but sometimes decisions should not be fulfilled without thinking about it wisely.. Mistakes are normal for us human beings but we do not fail to improve ourselves day by day.

im 14, and i know you all might think that im just being rebellious and shits. but no, me and my siblings has been abused as long as we can remember, both physically and mentally, our abuser was none other by our mom— sometimes dad. our mom got into a hospital last year (reason why i started) and was bedridden, so we all now were forced to take care of our abuser. it takes a fucking toll to a child you know, carrying the burden to have to take care of someone that was supposed to take care of you. 

so yeah, i stared smoking 2024 around april. and i never looked back, it was one of my getaway, i know i have problems, and i know what to do with them instead of smoking it all away. but I'm a child. im still a child, i make mistakes, and i kept making them, that's what makes me a child for godsake, just because i can shoulder it doesn't mean im not fucking it up every once in a while. 

i don't know what to do. my sisters all i got, shes my parent, shes my everything, and her seeing me like this—like a fucking thug. I don't want that. im still me, im still her sister. I don't know how to feel— should i be angry that she didn't try to understand me. or sad because I don't know what's gonna happen now, frightenend?

I know he hasn’t  cheated but I’m absolutely broken hearted that he lied to me. I’m really struggling to get over the pain and humiliation I felt and every time I bring it up he goes nuts telling me I’m being ridiculous and should just get over it?!?
Am I wrong to feel upset about this? I think his reaction is just making it worst as he just doesn’t want to talk about it at all and has become really quite nasty whenever I bring it up. 

What should I do?

1kmbgwb,Is it ok for me to hate and feel disgusted by my father ?,chewyarr,"Recently , my father’s cheating has been discovered . Something I’ve suspected for 2 years but my word was never taken seriously by others when I consulted them . 

The mistress ? If I could call them mistress , were multiple girls from various spas , all from different countries such as Vietnam and Myanmar and China (?)

He would often claim that he had work matters or meetings with friends , leading him to stay out till late at night or come late for things , but that was not the case . The find my app on my phone said otherwise , saying that he was actually at the various spas , entertaining the girls .   

When my mother confronted him , he “ told the truth “ and things were getting better , i thought my life would go back to as it was pre finding out .

He still plainly lies to us , saying he has work matters or gatherings , only to look for the girls . He claims it’s because he feels like he lacks attention , but my mother NEVER did anything bad to him , the only thing was she gave me more attention recently due to supporting me when I was recovering from my ed . Could he really be jealous of a MOTHER giving her ONLY DAUGHTER who was mentally unstable attention , so jealous that he decided to seek comfort from OTHER WOMEN outside ?? 

I get he’s my father , I would say he’s quite a good father indeed , doting on me from young . But , while a good father he’s a horrible husband . Whenever I see him  , I feel a strong sense of hatred and disgust . I don’t feel the reassurance I once felt from him as a father anymore , and I doubt I will feel it again . 

I know he won’t stop his habits , but I can stop mine . I’m trying my best to go all in Ed recovery so at least I wouldn’t be a burden on my mother anymore , but it has me wondering , if I can go all in to change myself , why can’t he ? He’s an educated man , with a masters degree and even a teacher . He should have more common sense than a teenage girl , am i right ? 

I really don’t know how to feel , I don’t want to add more burden to my mother , I want to be strong and just pretend I don’t know anything but I just can’t . 

Is it ok to hate and feel disgust when I see him ? Do I really have to respect him ? How can I help my mother ? ",4,6,1747217320.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kmbgwb/is_it_ok_for_me_to_hate_and_feel_disgusted_by_my/
1kmagzk,How Do I Handle My BIL’s Girlfriend Who Clearly Dislikes My Kids?,No_Illustrator8771,"I live in a multi-generational household with my kids, my brother-in-law (BIL), and his girlfriend (BIL's GF). Lately, things have become really tense and uncomfortable.

My BIL's GF has been treating my kids, especially my 2-year-old, in a way that feels disrespectful. I can feel the animosity from her whenever she interacts with them, and it’s obvious that she doesn’t like them, particularly my 2-year-old. She’s very dismissive, and it’s starting to affect how they act around her. It’s so frustrating because I know my kids aren’t perfect, but they’re just kids, and they don’t deserve to be treated like a problem just for existing.

I’ve tried to speak up about it, but every time I do, she flips it, plays the victim, and I end up feeling like I’m causing drama. I honestly don’t care about causing drama at this point. If it happens, it happens. I just want to make sure my kids aren’t being mistreated in their own home.

I’m fed up and don’t know how to handle it without things blowing up. I want to live peacefully with my kids, but I don’t know what to do when one person in the house clearly doesn’t respect them. How can I stand up for them without making everything worse?

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.",1,3,1747213086.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kmagzk/how_do_i_handle_my_bils_girlfriend_who_clearly/
1km5l6m,Advice/Rant - Struggling with boundaries/how to help parents,Primary_Day3721,"I'll start by saying that this is both a post to vent a torrent of emotions I've held back for years, but also something I could use *any* advice for. 

I \[25F\] am the only child of my folks \[who are in their early 60s\]. We have faced many tumultuous times since the mid 2000s when my parents lost their business and developed debt issues as a result (the magnitude of which was largely unknown for a couple of years as my father handled the finances). Prior to this, my father struggled with addiction issues as well. Many of my nights from 7 years old onward involved trying to keep the peace between my mother and father.

As my therapist recently revealed to me, it was apparent from a young age that my folks ""co-regulated"" their emotions with me more so than I did with them. I definitely think there's some kind of trauma bond with my mother, too, because of all of this. 

The lack of money, the increasing debts, the addiction issues, and health scares have created a perfect storm of regular fights and general unhappiness for both my mother and father. I have tried to set boundaries with them about placing me in the middle of their arguments a couple of years ago - and for the most part that held - until the last couple of months. I receive paragraphs from my (likely intoxicated) father detailing how upset he is. (To my mother's credit she does not inform me of these disagreements.) It has also been said to me by both of my folks that I am the main source of their happiness.

In many other ways, they have been wonderful parents. Fully supportive of all of my endeavors, telling me they love me, making my favorite foods when I visit, spending normal quality time together. The highs are high with them, but lows are low. 

At this point, I have moved away to be with my long-term partner. The distance has given me a lot of clarity, but with it comes some hard truths I don't know how to face. Their issues, from financial to interpersonal, are draining me emotionally, to the point that I am so depressed over the situation I can barely get out of bed. I am crying every day over things that, frankly, I shouldn't even be involved in. Being an only child amplifies the strain: I feel have no one to turn to for help. No other family, no siblings. It feels like I am completely alone in this, but also that this is a cage of my own design for involving myself at such a young age with my ""help,"" which has become commonplace for nearly the last two decades. 

I am so angry, so sad, so depressed, so anxious. I am doing my best to work things on my own and hold boundaries firm without having regrets related to my folks and the love I have for them. It feels paradoxical and I am so lost. 

Thanks for reading this far. If you've experienced this, if you have any thoughts or advice, I'd be so grateful. 

TLDR: I have had a tumultuous relationship largely with my father, but have come to recognize hard truths about my parents who both intentionally and inadvertently involve me in their problems despite me being a grown adult, who lives far away. I am drowning with a combination of guilt, anxiety and stress, as their only child. Any thoughts or advice appreciated.

I’m not concerned about what they really think, how they act towards me. My brain became numb to it. I’m concerned that my fight won’t be enough. I’m concerned that I won’t be enough😭 that I won’t make it outta here and will be bound to live this miserable life with my family full of toxicity and ill wishes. But I promised that I’ll find a way and I take even those risky steps one at time. Because my voice can’t suffer in silence forever and because this was never my fault❤️‍🩹 I’m just the one who happen to live here. I wanna be free so much it hurts.
These days….its hard not to not cry.
BASICALLY
My family is a living hell. This to every wish that I’ll make it outta here like maybe many other silenced ppl around the world. Have to. Ain’t no way I’m staying w them forever. 
I can’t even express how numb u can be after all of this. It’s as if brain itself adapts. 
Safety is protection of keeping things private, but my voice suffers in silence.
😔 
You know what’s worse feeling than not having freedom? Listening to their manipulations of how they try to threaten my situation. And this had been like this for years. I have nothing to be grateful for them and no amount of guilt tripping or control management from them can change the fact that I know the truth.

1klrcct,I don’t care that my mother is struggling,Its_a_meow_from_me,"I’ve had quite the relationship with my mother. 
Back in October 2023 I went through a really dark time in my life and I opened up to her about it, instead of being a mother she played victim and got angry at me for hurting her, yet it was ME in pain and nothing that had happened during that time had anything to do with her. I literally just needed my mom. 

I then saw a psychologist and it was decided that my mom was not good for me, that I would not be in a safe place around her and it was best to avoid her. I cancelled my Christmas plans and decided to stay home. 

Leading up to December, my step father started calling and begging me to visit. He ended up passing away a week before Christmas (cancer, none of us knew). 
He was the main provider in the household and my mother had nowhere to go. 
So, I sucked it up and had her move across the country to live with me. 
It’s been pretty rough but it’s better than kicking her out on the street. 
She lost her own mother a few months after her husband. She has no friends. Nobody to talk to. Nowhere to go. 
I can see she’s struggling and she’s in so much pain, but I simply don’t give a damn. 
I struggle to look her in the eye and show any interest in her… And it’s literally just dawned on me, that I’m probably a horrible person. I understand all the pain and loneliness she’s experiencing and she truely does need me, but I think that’s her problem and she needs to get over it by herself just like I had to when I needed HER. 

Anyway. I probably could have shortened this message, but has anybody gone through this? Is there any advice on how to be a better person??

1klr0xl,Cleaning my house,pat_misguided,"I live in a pretty messy house with 5 other people. I am planning on moving out very soon, and my mom wants to have a going away party. However, to have the party, I have to clean the house. My only problem is that 95% of the mess is not mine and about 70% of it is my little sister’s (9). Anytime I try to get her to get her stuff, she just starts crying, then goes to my mom. My mom always responds to this with, “Well it’s your party, you need to clean the house.” I do not care if I have a party or not. I invited about 3 of my friends to it, while the other 30 are friends of my mom’s. I would just throw everyone’s stuff into their own respective rooms, but I share one with my little sister, so if you can imagine how messy it already is with me trying to move out and her just refusing to clean. I would also like to mention that I am usually a very organized and clean person, however, living with people that aren’t has just made me decide to wait until I get my own space to keep it clean. 

I know that the only reason we are having the party is so that I can be forced to clean the house without anyone having to help me out, despite most of it not being mine, but I don’t know what to do. I can’t just tell my mom I don’t want to have the party because then she will get upset, but also being forced to deal with cleaning it is going to drive me crazy. ",1,1,1747155240.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1klr0xl/cleaning_my_house/

She met my brother and married him over 10 years ago. I never liked her, but I tried. I tried because I couldn't imagine not having a sister in law that I adored. I'm a family oriented, social, outgoing person. She is not. I made excuses, denied, tried to 'fake it til I make it', etc.... but a few years into it I just had to face reality (according to me) that she is just a cold bitch. She is not a bitch to my brother, she appears to be a good wife and a good mom. (she is just not too affectionate and not super into her kids the way I am) I have no kids and am not married. I live a single carefree life and am an amazing aunt (she has even said so). I always told myself be grateful because things and people and situations could always be worse. It did get worse (the way she treated me) after she got cancer. (She is ok now) She is sometimes tolerable and sometimes nice. Is it just me she treats this way? Not always. She ignores me, puts me down, acts superior and is super nice and normal when it comes to people she likes (meaning her friends, her family and maybe some people in my family if she likes them, but not usually. Most of the time she is rude to my family and friends-it's embarrassing and disappointing and actually devastating to me). She is of a different culture than us as well. I also feel that she (and my brother) take advantage of my parents. I've spoken to my parents many times about this, but in the end all we care about is having an amazing relationship with their kids - which we do. Over the years people started making comments to me in my family and it made me realize I'm not the only one who feels this way about her. I've never confronted her or my brother about it because I tried to protect my relationship with him and I felt if I complained it would just cause problems. In the beginning when I tried to have a good relationship with her she made it clear (by her actions not words) that she did not want to be friends or close to me so I stopped trying (social invites, being friendly etc). Now I speak to her when I have to (hello goodbye, want some Rosé? and any logistics about the kids). On Mother's Day we all went to their house (her relatives, my parents and I) and it was a great time. I get along well with her relatives and her friends. She did not say one word to me the entire day other than hello and goodbye. She also made 4 cocktails when we arrived - for every adult in the house except my mother and I, and didn't even offer us a drink. This is the norm.

1kld68v,My mom always takes her anger out on me,Infamous-Post6881,"I’m a 16 year old sophomore in high school. My mom started taking her anger out on me for years and it’s starting to really affect my life. I have a lot of my own things and stress going in my life that I never shared with her. Every time I tried to talk to her about my life or feelings, things immediately go downhill. Sometimes the things she says really breaks my heart and the voice level she yells at me pierces through my ears causing me to tear up. I have an older sister who’s now 23 years old. She moved out this year leaving me to be the only daughter at home and I do feel neglected. I lost a lot of childhood time due to the fact we have 2 boba shops that I’ve been forced to work in ever since I was in 7th grade til now. Every summer I would be working for free while my friends are out enjoying their life.

Some things my mom would include while yelling at me is, “Why are you so lazy and useless unlike ——‘s child!!” I would bring up the fact I get 5 hours of sleep everyday because I have to work EVERYDAY right after school ending my shift at 10 without pay. She then would bring up shit like, “Well food ain’t free, clothes ain’t free, rent ain’t free!” This made me question her “So what’s the point of giving birth to me? I’m not 18 yet and I’m incapable of taking care of myself already. I wasn’t asked to be brought out into this world so why am I feeling neglected?” She would then bring up my biological dad(divorced) that’s in a WHOLE other continent telling me to go back to him and that he wouldn’t want me even if I did.

She would consistently compare me to my sister no matter how hard I tried to show her I’m also capable of what I’m capable of. My sister always had her way of lying to my parents about her grades and I never snitched on her. She gaslighted them that she was the top of her class and had a 5.0 GPA. I quickly found out she was lying when I finally got into high school because she took regular classes while I took honors and ap. My grades started slipping since my mom always pulled me down. I was believing that I’ll never be smart enough even if I try my hardest. I went from being a straight A student first semester to I don’t give a fuck anymore for second semester. My gpa is still high with unweighted 3.9 and weighted of 4.something. I showed my grades to my mom, she doesn’t know english so she would make my sister look at it. My sister would chuckle and said in college my 3.9 unweighted gpa would be a 2.0. Of course my mom would believe her over me cuz who am I to say anything else if that’s what she’s going to believe?

I’m so tired of life and the way she takes everything out on me whenever she’s mad. ☹️ I feel like I’m in my own world with my emotions trapped inside of me. Today she crashed out on me after I finished all the chores she asked me to complete just because there was paper towel on the floor in MY room. She stared complaining to leave my door open otherwise she’s going to break my whole door!! (Apparently I’m always doing bad things in my room? Bruh what bad things am I doing in my room? It’s not like my room’s a bank I’m gunna rob!?!? I feel drained cuz now I can’t even have my own privacy and I feel hurt 24/7 because of the words she says to me.

1kl95ga,My sister scares me,Exotic-Vegetable-837,"For starters my sister and I are both adults and are close in age. We have always been very different, she is outgoing and social while I am more reserved, she loves beauty supplies and shopping trips and I really don’t, etc…

One of the main ways we are different though is the way we deal with stress in our lives. When things become too much for me, I often cry and occasionally have panic attacks, whereas she grows insatiably angry. Although I’m not here to say what is the ‘better way’ of handling emotions, I know for a fact mine is less destructive.

My sister often becomes irritated by little things like mine or my family’s appearance or habits, minor inconveniences, the consequences of her own actions and so on. This will often lead to full on meltdowns where she screams, throws things, and occasionally physically abuses people…well, only me, really, but we’ll get to that. This behavior has scared my family into giving her whatever she wants. As a result she gets things like designer clothes, a nicer car than I have, she gets to park in the garage while I park on the street, she has the largest room at our parents house and her own bathroom and I stay in the guest room. This is mainly because I will grit my teeth and bare it to avoid a massive tantrum.

The last time something like this happened she threw me to the floor and dared me to fight her. When my parents became aware of what had happened, she started hyperventilating, shaking and rocking back and forth on the ground wildly, all while calling for “mommy and daddy” who were furious with her.

Right now I’m hiding out while she’s having another melt down. I’m not sure how I’m supposed to manage this anymore. I’m always her target and I don’t feel safe about the idea of living with her, which I’ll have to do for a while. I’ve talked to my therapist for many years about this, but I’m not sure how much more of this I can take. Hopefully after these next few months I won’t have to live with her again.",4,2,1747097823.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kl95ga/my_sister_scares_me/
1kl7lz4,I want to leave my Mom in another province,R3n857,"
I 29 year old female left Ontario when I was 22 and moved to New Brunswick on my own. 

I wanted independence. My mom and I have always had a complicated relationship. She has some mental health issues and had a stroke (which she thankfully fully recovered from) when I was 12. I have always been her security blanket and had to do everything with her. She has a history of moving us in with abusive boyfriends with very little care for my feelings or safety. 

I found a little apartment that I loved and for about a year I was broke, struggling, but SO happy. 

In 2018 my Mom decided to move to New Brunswick as well. We were living in separate towns so I was fine with it. 3 months after arriving in New Brunswick she was fired from her job and had to move out (her apartment was part of her salary) so I did the only thing I could think and left the apartment I loved and found us a bigger place. 

5 months after moving back in together I came home from work to find out she had moved ANOTHER man into the house. Now, he seemed to be a decent guy, but that wasn't the point. I was an adult, both our names were on the lease, I didn't feel like she had a right to move him and all his stuff in. I let it go. 

Just before our lease was up she gave me 2 weeks notice and informed me they were moving to another town. Being stuck I went with them for about a month until I found another place. It was small cramped, but once again I was on my own and loved it. 

1 year later, my mom asked me to take over the mortgage payments at the boyfriends moms place as she was going into a nursing home. I agreed as the rent was cheap and he gave me a 2 year lease. 

9 months after moving into the house she hated the guy and wanted him out. Which meant of course... he had to move into the house that I was staying in. 

She called me everyday crying until finally I agreed to leave and move back in with her to the town she wanted to be in. She said she convinced him to let me ""break my lease"". 

We split the rent 50/50. I pay internet and cable. I live in her house on her terms. 

I cant have people over because her dog is an asshole, I am not allowed to do laundry or use the dishwasher. Everytime I make a phone call she ""accidentally"" walks into the back room, so I can have 0 private conversations. 

Everytime I try and tell her that this isn't the life I signed up for she calls me dramatic. She has 0 compassion for the fact she stole my 20's, and thinks I wanted this. 

She often states that we will live together forever, and she can't afford to live in this house alone. 

I am really tempted to go back to Ontario now that I have a decent job. 

Am I really in the wrong here? ",1,0,1747093350.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kl7lz4/i_want_to_leave_my_mom_in_another_province/
1kl71ni,Issues with much older female relative,Fearny_500,"I will call this older female relative ""A"". A and I have a good relationship most of the time, but occasionally we have fights. Recently A and I fought about whether she was capable of safely using mosquito dunks (anti-mosquito pellets) and whether a relative I will call ""B"" should call his daughter spoiled. The first fight happened because I brought my dog, who frequently eats things that aren't food, to A's house and I was worried he would get into the mosquito dunks. A didn't like when I asked her to be careful where she put them, so my dog wouldn't eat them. She was offended as she also has a dog and felt that I was claiming she wasn't smart enough to know not to leave them within reach of a dog. A is a very careful person, but I wanted to remind her, because they are in a package he can bite through to get to the dunks. A became frustrated and said I should do it myself. I don't want to do that as she has done a good job of keeping both dogs out of the dunks, I just wanted to be extra cautious as my dog is very unwise when it comes to what he will eat. I felt she was being overly sensitive. I even told her I was only concerned about an accidental issue and that I would never think she would do that on purpose or that she was foolish. Our other argument happened because I overheard a conversation where B told A that his daughter was spoiled for asking him if he was going back to work so he could take care of his daughter's needs. B's daughter is in her mid-teens and B recently got let go from his job, so his company could hire someone younger. I felt uncomfortable with B saying that and let A know why I might look uncomfortable. B is A's son so she wasn't too happy when I told her I felt it was unfair for him to call his daughter spoiled when he had been not very involved in her life and had gotten her to help him cheat in a mobile game for him.

1kl6bwa,Did I do the right thing ?,Ok_Competition_1982,"
My sister and her boyfriend have been having relationship problems, and somehow it’s started affecting me too. A few months ago, my sister told our family that she caught her boyfriend texting and seeing someone else. Naturally, that gave all of us — a bad impression of him. I even started to dislike him, based on what she told us.

During a family holiday gathering, I went on a drink run with both of my sisters. On the way, the sister who had accused her boyfriend of cheating asked me to drop her off to meet up with another guy — a coworker she’d apparently been talking to. At the time, I didn’t question it. I supported her because I thought she was the one who’d been wronged.

But a few months later, more drama came up involving my sister that made me see things a little differently. That led to my other sister telling the boyfriend what had happened on that holiday — including that I was the one who dropped her off.

That’s how I got dragged into this. I never intended to say anything, but when he asked me directly, I told him the truth. He even admitted that he had started having doubts about her over time, which might’ve been why he messed up in the first place. Looking back, I think my sister gave us a one-sided version of things and made him look worse than he was — while she also wasn’t being fully transparent.

I don’t feel good being in the middle, but I also don’t feel right lying. Morally, I think it’s wrong to be dishonest, and if I were in his shoes, I would’ve wanted to know. From a man-to-man perspective, I felt like the truth was the right thing to say.

1kl10qb,Am I wrong,Any_University_9653,"I need advice if I'm wrong for wanting to distance myself from my family. I 33 single (f) moved into my mothers house with my 3 kids due to unforeseen circumstances. she has a big house and is occupied by 13 people yes thats alot, my older sister is who is 37 and her 37( bf) live on the inlaw side connected to the house with her 3 kids one in which she shares child with her BF. 

  Since moving in ive experienced excessive emotional abuse from my mother and my sisters BF. thier has a been a few occasions that I try to brush off but things have been getting worse. On one inpertucualr case my sister doesnt drive so I basically became the sefer of the house because my sister  Bf will refuse to pick up my niece, or my sister from work, I was asked one day to pick up my niece I said yes but Iwas changed to my mother getting her instead which I had relayed to my sister. well when my sister and her boyfriend got home he went off on me telling to drink bleach and die that no one wants me thier. I obviously was taken back at how someone can say such awful things my sister completely took his side. 
  Now No one likes him he can be very condensing and doesn't have respect for anyone.
few things happen similar but I just brushed it on but this most recent incident left me feeling a very certain way. I had to bring my daughter to the dentist it was raining where I normally park at my house is on the grass thiers also a bunch of other cars taking up space that are his and refuses to move them so I can park. my mother and him will park in front of the garage so no one was home so I decided to just park where they do because the grass was flooded and supper muddy, I wasn't parked for very long when I left to go pick up my son from daycare my sister's bf blocked me in purposely knowing that the other spot in the drive was empty and refused to move his car calling me belligerent names. he made me late picking my son up, and as he was coming out side he had a snigh smirk on his face like it was funny. 
    This next incident happened few days after the pior one so I had done an oil change my motorcycle I accidentally spilled oil on the ground was a mistake it was getting late and dark out so I poured kitty litter onto the spilled oil to soak it up, the next day I had to do a oil change on my car but I had to leave early to pick up my son from his father's it was mothers day I wanted to spend sometime with him, so I moved my car in back of my mothers car once i got home to clean up the kitty litter and do my cars oil change well my sister's bf before I could do anything made a comment about I ignored him because i was going to do it anyways. well he didnt like that and decided to scoop all the oiled kitty litter on to front breaks and car. 
    At this point I've about had so yes I did lash out because he is trying to ruin my stuff he had malicious intent behind well I tell my sister and what she does sticks up from again saying it was my fault. Of course I've had a few choice of words because before I had told her I will take care it so she could tell him if he complained. This was all on mothers day. once I confronted him because i had enough he started calling a crybaby, manipulative the B word every nasty name you can think of, yes I said stuff back but now I feel like none of my family has my back my mom makes excuses my sister doesnt seem care. other family thinks I'm being to sensitive.

1kkz718,Looking for a long lost sibling.,LightAndJoy_CA,"My mother had a younger brother, but they were separated when they were both very young. At the time, her mother and younger sibling migrated to the United States, while my mom remained in the Philippines. Her brother was probably under 10 years old when they left, and my mom was around 18 at the time.

Unfortunately, they lost all contact after the migration, and my mom has not heard from her brother or mother since then. Fast forward to 2025—my mother is now 64 years old and currently living in the U.S., having moved here just two years ago. She’s been longing to reconnect with her brother, who would now be around 50 to 55 years old. We have very little information to ago on, but she wants to try to find him.

1kkyqby,Do I cut my mom off?,Stunning-Ad-8517,"The first two screenshots are mine and the last is what my mom said to my sister today. She hasn’t been speaking to either of us. My mom has always been manipulative and living with a victim mentality. Nobody ever tells her she’s wrong because she’ll cry and hold a grudge for years. None of her family had anything to do with her because of this but she recently started having a relationship with her mom again after 12 years of no contact (they act the exact same way) I only really hear from my mom when she wants to use me for a ride because she doesn’t work or drive.

Where this starts is in February, my mom asked if I could pick up my grandma from the airport before Easter. I said I didn’t think I’d be able to but I’d let her know. She got pissed and said nevermind it’s not my responsibility to take care of them. I even told my mom I’d get a discount for a rental car for my grandma so they can do what they need to do as I was out of town for Easter. She didn’t offer it to my grandma because she was mad at me but once she got over it she brought it up to my grandma and then Grandma was pissed that I didn’t offer it sooner (even though I did but my mom chose to withhold that info because she was mad at me).

I sent pictures everyday while we were on vacation and then back to school and she ignored them all. So yesterday on Mother’s Day I snapped. The second her mom is here she just doesn’t care about me. She does that when my sister visits too. I do everything for her but as soon as someone new comes around she talks bad about me behind my back and cry’s when I find out. She’s also most likely lying about grandma falling. She’s been consistently posting on facebook and also change her cover photo (that use to be a pic of my son) the day of my sisters sons birthday that she claims she was too busy caring for her injured mother to send a message.

She lies about everything and always says “I wake up breathing and everyone hates me” she truly doesn’t see anything she does as wrong. 

So what I’m wondering is do I tell her how I feel AGAIN? Or do I just block her and never talk to her again. I honestly don’t think there’s any saving this relationship. Or if I’d even want that. Sorry for the long read.",1,0,1747071532.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkyqby
1kky8zw,After 25 years my dad isn’t really my dad.,Puzzleheaded_Bag4043,"So I have no idea where to post this and as far as I know none of my family had a Reddit so. 

So a few years ago I did an ancestry dna test. I didn’t really pay attention to everything at first until recently and it has DNA matches that show “maternal” and “paternal” side. Then it also shows your ethnicities by parent. The ones on the “paternal” side were not adding up. So I went and talked to my brother (he is 8 years older than me). Back in 1999 my parents had separated and my mom met this guy online. She said he was an old friend but it was probably just so my brother didn’t tell anyone something else. Anyways, my mom and brother went and visited this guy down to Mississippi where he lived. They stayed for a week and then they came back. I have no idea how things ended. When she was 10-11 weeks pregnant with me she filed for divorce from her husband but then they never got a divorce. Anyways, my brother was trying to tell me all he remembered and he remembered the guys first name. I got in touch with someone who literally finds bio family through ancestry. He found my potential father and the pieces of the puzzle are making sense. My brother is taking an ancestry dna test as well just to see what pops up for him and if it’ll put us as half siblings. The guy that found him gave me his Facebook and the contact info he could find for him. I have no idea where to go. My mom has never even brought him up. Just a long time ago she said her and my brother flew to Mississippi and that was it. There’s so many possible outcomes. Once my brother gets the dna results I am going to wait a bit to talk to my mom as my husband and I are about to have our 4th baby in a few weeks and moving into a new house. I’m already stressed about everything and we know my mom is going to completely flip out. I do not have a relationship with the guy who raised me anymore. Lots of stuff happened a long time ago. My mom has been remarried to my step dad for almost 6 years. I love my step dad. He is great. But my mom flips out over stuff, especially if it’s something she knows she did wrong but always plays the victim. Now I love my mom and she is a great grandma and I don’t want anything to affect her relationship with my kids. However, I feel like I deserve to know the truth about myself. I’ve talked to my husband about starting therapy to process my emotions about this whole thing and figure out the best next steps so when I talk to her maybe we can keep it peaceful and civilized. I feel like this is something she would’ve taken to her grave honestly. I haven’t had anything to do with the guy who raised me in 5 years and during this time she has never said anything. I do plan on contacting the guys after I talk to her. We don’t know the whole story so this guy could’ve not wanted me, but he was great to my brother and has two sons himself. His younger son has a little girl and he seems like a good grandpa and doesn’t seem like he would be a deadbeat. So I’m not sure. I don’t know. I feel bad for my brother because he has carried this since he was 7 years old. And per my brother, there had been things said in the family about me not being the daughter of the guy who raised me. Another thing is, both my parents have blue eyes, my brother has blue eyes.. I have brown eyes. Guess who else has brown eyes? Potential father. This is a stressful situation because there’s so many outcomes for this situation like my mom’s reaction, how this guy is going to react, what if we decide to have a relationship and how that affects my kids because the only grandpa they know on my side is my step dad. We haven’t told them any different. I don’t know. I’m just stressed and upset that my mom even put me in this situation.

1kkvop1,"My twin brother betrayed me, and I can’t find anybody to talk with about it",Local_Attitude9089,"**For context, I’m 19 years old, and I’ve been dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil, especially regarding my twin brother. We used to be close, but over time, our relationship has become strained, and now I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him.**

I’ve been isolating myself for the last two years, focusing on my studies to get into elite schools and make my parents proud. But in doing so, I’ve lost the chance to have close friends, except for my sister. I don’t have anyone to be open with about everything that’s been going on.

I’ve always tried to respect the unspoken rules between my brother and me, especially when it came to relationships and girls. There was this girl my brother was talking to, and even though I could tell there was some kind of interest on his part, I made sure to keep my distance. I didn’t want to interfere, so I subtly made it clear I wasn’t interested in her. I thought that was the right thing to do—just to help him out and avoid making things weird.

On my side, there was this girl from my school. We’d talk as classmates in a group with the guys—nothing serious, just casual conversation. She was cool, and everything seemed fine between us. But then, things started to change.

My brother began talking to her, and at first, I didn’t think much of it. I didn’t have strong feelings for her; she was just a cool friend that I appreciated having, and I just wanted to be a good friend, you know?

However, things got strange when I noticed how she started engaging with him. A few days ago, I found out she had sent him a message. It wasn’t just a casual “hello.” She called him by his name—something she had once done with me, but I responded late, so she didn’t reply. But he went further, sending her long messages asking about her interests and things like that.

Not to mention, he hides his contacts from me and excludes me when he talks about girls he’s interested in with the boys. And the fact that he already has a girlfriend that he still hides from me is confusing. He once hinted at it, saying, “I think you know her, you showed her to me once.”

So yeah, when he got that message from my friend, we were with some family members, and he mentioned it in front of me, saying, “Oh, there’s a girl who sent me a message by my name.” They were all cheering him on in front of me, and I felt completely invisible. I couldn’t help but feel hurt.

When I looked at his phone, I saw that she had a profile picture on WhatsApp that I hadn’t seen on mine. She added him, even though she didn’t know him well, but didn’t add me. There was a time when we were talking with that girl, and she took my phone to add herself and send me a personality test.

Out of curiosity, I waited until my brother was asleep to see how things were going between them. They were still chatting, and I saw her calling him “honey” and “hun.” Feeling bamboozled and betrayed by both of the closest people I know, I decided to block her and ghost her in real life because I felt disrespected. I haven’t spoken to my brother since.

A day later, he came to me like nothing had happened. When I hinted that I didn’t want to talk to him anymore, he said, “Why aren’t you talking to me? Are you acting snobby or something?” Knowing he has narcissistic traits, I just said, “No.” I don’t know if he knows he messed up, but he never apologized or confronted me about it, and I didn’t either because every time I confront him, he just twists my words, and I end up getting angry and fighting him.

I tried talking to my sister about it, but she got irritated and told me, “You’re insecure. You should have told him you had feelings for that girl (whom I now call a bitch).” But I thought we had unspoken rules. Then she started crying, knowing she has her own problems, and I made her day worse. I ended up breaking my phone out of anger and locked myself in my room.

I can’t talk to my sister anymore after what happened, and I don’t feel like I can talk to my parents, especially with our cultural background, where things like this are considered a bit “taboo” in our religious family.

I’m overwhelmed. What did I do wrong? And was it the right decision to ghost that girl and not talk to my brother again?",2,1,1747064416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kkvop1/my_twin_brother_betrayed_me_and_i_cant_find/

1kkfpa3,Advice on Fiancés Family,Unlikely_Impact_4658,"I’ve been with my fiancé for a decade now and have never felt particularly close to his family. He has brothers who want to be very actively involved in his life, despite not connecting with them on the same sorts of things. One has a wife and kids, the other is ten years younger and single, so that kind of paints the background.

They seem to have a tribe mentality and don’t like anyone new joining the mix or the family. The brother’s wife is very territorial and is the self proclaimed matriarch of the family, too, so if you’re not on her side, you might as well not be part of this whole thing. Prior to us getting engaged, the brothers made off handed comments about me, saying things like “well I just don’t see getting to know her if you guys aren’t going to get married, or if this is just another one of your long-term relationships that end.” And they’ve also alluded to me being a gold digger in a way, despite my fiancé not making much money when we first got together and me giving no thought to his money or trying to take it.

It’s the type of family where the status quo remains, and they don’t really bother with me when I’m around, don’t care to get to know me, etc. I just feel like a wallflower during family events and have to show up to support my fiancé knowing full well the things they’ve said about me in the past.

My fiancé has talked to them and come to my defenses, so I don’t think that that’s the problem, I guess I just don’t know how to proceed with a family that doesn’t seem to like me and that I don’t like either. They want a relationship with my fiancé, of course, but I notice that he’s different when he’s around them — tends to complain more, be negative, only talk about the past and the good ol’ days, etc. they just don’t seem to be going anywhere with their life (just focused on their own family, which is fine), but that’s not what me and my fiancé are about. We’re pulling away because we have different interests but it seems as though the brothers are clinging to what the relationship between them “should be like.”

1kkfb3a,Should I cut my family off?,AMC_Night,"

Some context: I'm a 30(f) who is part of a blended family (step mom, step sister, step brother, bio dad, and 3 bio siblings) we all lived and grew up under the same roof (from when I was 10 to 19)

I had a very hard teen life (self harm, trouble at school and with authority and stealing). My mother died when I was 9 and my dad quickly remarried to my step mom and things went down hill from there.

At 19 I moved out with my now husband. I still see my family multiple times a year.

Today, mothers day (I have no kids) and the celebration of my birthday and my step moms (mine is 5/19 hers is today 5/11) my step sister said the most hurtful thing I have heard since I was a teen.

We were all joking about times we had emotional blow outs and how far we've come. I joked about the time she broke the Bluetooth headphones for the TV by throwing them when she was mad. She responded verbatim ""remember the time you cut your self and got blood everwhere.?"" (She had to drop her son of at his dad's and I think she was mad about that)

I was stunned speechless and excused myself to the bathroom where I proceeded to sob then decided to leave the party early with my husband (he didn't hear her say that)

I have always been the black sheep of the family, the troubled one, the scapegoat and rule breaker. Always the topic in therapy.

I've done well for myself, I've got a great union job, a husband and my own place. But every time I see my family, I'm made fun of, belittled and harrased. I'm allowed no peace from the events of a traumatized teen.

The dinner table was FULL, my sister, my sister in law, step brother and step mom and even dad. And no one  came to my defense to what she said. I get horrible anxiety whenever I have to see them. If my step sister isn't bullying me, it's my sister. 

My step mom had the nerve to try to have me stay for my cake, but I couldn't hold it together so I left.

I'm so tired of this, of having no peace, of getting so far just to be kicked back down when you see your family.

They are very dependent, ask for help frequently and very few times do they give in return. His sister was also struggling with this and took her husband and kids and moved away. 

My husband wants to make sure he is doing the right thing, but sometimes I think it’s too much. We have taken in his older brother for the last 7 months as he had gone through a series of issues and needed a place to live while everything is sorted out. Now I feel like it’s getting to be too much. 

My husband works hard, but I feel like between the mom and the older brother there is always something. And I feel like they turn to us because my husband has a soft spot for them plus we both have jobs, both have cars, both went to college. I know if this was my family we wouldn’t have this issue because my parents taught me and my siblings to be very self reliant.

I’m struggling a lot because I want to be supportive of my husband but I feel like this is really effecting us and he can’t see it because it’s his family. I finally snapped yesterday, and said what was on my mind, but it seemed like it didn’t do anything except make me look like the bad person for not wanting to help someone in need. 

I don’t know what to do. Maybe someone has been in the same situation.",2,0,1747000704.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kkcjdr/struggling_w_in_laws/
1kk8w73,I'm a horrible uncle smh,Weary_Kangaroo647,"I've always been a bad uncle. And it's always been in the back of my mind but I'd just ignore that voice. I have 3 nieces and 3 nephews. Now I'm a bad uncle to all of them I'm the sense that I never really thought too much about them, never really called them to check up and other than my oldest nephew I never remembered birthdays. No movies, no gifts, no McDonald's, no hanging out in general. 
There's a few reasons for this.
1. I was young when the first 4 were born, still a kid myself.
2. Always been a bum, always a step behind and feel like I have to get somewhere before I can focus on others (goes for friendships and relationships as well).
3. No car to transport these kiddos and I live far as well. 
Now whenever I was around them I treated them great and they loved me as an uncle but they didn't see much of me and I didn't really try to see them either. What makes me feel even worse is my oldest nephew is now 18 (I'm 31). He and I always had the tightest bond, the other kids in the family would bully him due to autism and I was the one who looked out for him and always made sure he was okay and having fun. Also I used to babysit him and have sleepovers before I moved (this included his second born sister who I also had a great relationship with but to a lesser degree than my nephew) .
I feel horrible because he turned 18 last week and I realize I haven't seen him since he was 14. We've barely spoken other than casual texts and phone calls all of those 4 years. He'd always call me with stuff he knew I'd like or to try to impress me with what he did or to try to come over and spend the night, except he's 18 now stopped asking like 2 years ago and barely looks for me anymore. He still responds when I text him and seems okay to talk to me but he no longer reaches out. I think he doesn't know that I loved him his whole life and how much I care for him. I'm a terrible uncle and coming to terms with this has made me a mess.

1kk8o40,Was cutting ties with my mum the right decision?,MisterM03,"My partner and I have been together for almost five years. We got together in 2020, but things really began a couple of years before that, when we became friends through a Volunteering group (VG). Back then, Harvey was openly gay, but I wasn’t — not even to friends and family. As far as my mum was concerned, I was just a straight teenager without a girlfriend.

Harvey and I became close quickly and our relationship deepened from there. We saw each other every Monday evenings through VG, then started messaging daily, playing Xbox, and meeting up more often. It wasn’t long before our connection became more intimate, and we became a couple on August 15th 2020.

Months passed, and eventually, I knew I needed to tell my family. I told a few close friends at first, and then I told my mum one day as I was heading to work. Harvey and I were now openly together and genuinely happy. My mum always claimed that as long as I was happy, she was happy — but that didn’t match how things felt.

At first, she tolerated Harvey visiting and staying over, but the atmosphere was often tense. There was no outright hostility, but also no warmth — never a truly welcoming environment for him. My half-brother, too, reinforced her early doubts and beliefs. They dismissed my relationship as “just a phase,” a product of lockdown boredom, something I’d grow out of. Despite my repeated efforts to explain that it wasn’t a phase, that I was serious about Harvey and happy, they didn’t listen.

To understand my mum, you have to know her background: she’s unpredictable, uneducated, and had a difficult childhood — foster care, skipping school, and losing her own mum young. Still none of it excused the truly shocking comments and actions she made over the years.

I remember one moment. We were all standing in the hallway at home. Harvey came close and casually put his arm around me. My mum looked at us, visibly shocked and disgusted, then she abruptly walked away. It wasn’t until weeks later that she brought it up to Harvey. She said, “I could have just punched you for that.” Now, I knew she’d never lay a hand on him — but he didn’t. No one would, especially when you don’t really know her.

Behind closed doors, she would question me. “Are you sure you don’t want to try being with a woman?” she’d ask. I always gave the same answer: I knew who I was and what I wanted. Each time, she’d repeat her line — “As long as you’re happy”.

Another time, while Harvey was staying over again at mine, I left for work and I’d return in the afternoon. My mum offered to take Harvey out for a walk with the dog. During the drive, she told him he should leave me. That I was just bored. That I wasn’t really gay. Harvey later told me he felt trapped in that car — unable to speak, unable to escape.

There have been good moments with my mum — times we all laughed, when she seemed to try — but it was always hard to forget the deeper damage. Even small nasty remarks that would re-open bigger, more hurtful wounds, you were also never sure when the good times would abruptly end.

She’d often say, “That’s just how I am. I say the wrong things sometimes — you just have to get used to it.

Over time, I repeatedly confronted her about her behaviour. Especially the things she’d say about Harvey’s family. She repeatedly called them “snobs,” claimed Harvey’s dad was having an affair — which wasn’t true — and belittled the way they lived their lives. It wasn’t just about Harvey, it was about the way she viewed anything different from her world. She knew nothing about Harvey’s family — she’d never even met them — but that didn’t stop her from making cruel comments. When I pushed back and told her how inappropriate and untrue they were, she’d snap: “Am I not allowed to say anything without you coming at me? Or “it’s just a joke”.

On my 21st birthday, she planned a family meal at a Hotel. Harvey and I had been together for four years. We arrived at her house, ready to leave together. However, it turned out to be a surprise party at her home. The night was surprisingly going well — family, friends, and laughter. I was shocked how well the night was going without incident. Then, I noticed her calling Harvey over. I watched them talk, and I felt uneasy. When he came back, he told me what she’d said: that he was controlling and jealous, and that I was missing out, finally saying that a friend that was at my party wasn’t gay, as if that mattered.

These weren’t one-off remarks. She frequently asked if Harvey and I argued. “Did you argue?” she’d ask, after a weekend away or a normal day. Most couples do argue occasionally — but her obsession with it felt invasive, even hopeful. In her eyes, I’d “lost my mojo,” and I “wasn’t the same funny person” anymore — all because of Harvey.

After the party, we invited her over for a serious conversation. She blamed the alcohol — Morgan Spiced Rum and vodka — but we reminded her that these kinds of comments had also come when she was sober. She eventually admitted she was wrong and apologised. She also admitted she was in a way jealous. We made progress that day, and I told her clearly: if the remarks didn’t stop, I’d walk away.

For a while, things improved. Harvey continued to make effort. He messaged her, visited her house, included her. But slowly, the comments crept back in.

She’d say things like “Hello stranger,” making it seem like Harvey was the one not reaching out — even though it was always him who made the effort. When we visited, she’d focus all her attention on me, ignoring Harvey entirely. It became exhausting.

Eventually, Harvey stopped messaging. She didn’t reach out either, and the silence between them grew. I still saw her on occasion, but from November to January, maybe even longer. They didn’t see or speak to each other.

During this time, Harvey left his job, and we were 100% fine financially. We chose not to tell her, knowing she’d make it into a bigger deal than it was. We explained it was handled, but she saw through it — watching for signs, checking if Harvey's car was home, asking indirectly, “is Harvey working today?”

We told her the truth: we didn’t tell her because we didn’t want to hear the endless worry, speculation, and judgment. Of course, she responded with, “Am I not allowed to worry?” But it wasn’t worry — it was criticism wrapped in concern.

Over the years, Harvey became numb to her comments. He tolerated them. Occasionally, they’d have a good conversation, but you never knew how long it would last. One day, they bumped into each other at the park and spoke for over an hour. They talked about Harvey’s past relationships, and his mental health. At the end of the conversation, she said to him, “Since you’re medicated now, you won’t be ungrateful and try and kill yourself again.”

He told me later, and I wasn’t shocked — just deeply hurt. He asked me not to confront her. I didn’t. But that moment stuck with me.

Eventually, I started to mirror her own behaviour — nasty remarks, sarcasm — just to show her how it felt. When I made a joke in return, she went into a huff and later sent a message accusing me of enjoying making her feel stupid. She blamed Harvey too, saying he “encouraged” me by “laughing like a schoolboy.”

That message crossed a line. I replied and reminded her: she’d been making cruel remarks for years, and I was done pretending they didn’t affect me.

She told me the past was in the past. That she couldn’t trust Harvey because he “twisted” things and tried to turn me against her. But nothing was twisted — Harvey never exaggerated. If anything, he tolerated too much.

I called her, angry and disappointed. She denied everything. Then hung up before I could finish. I called back six times. She didn’t answer.

So I wrote to her — a handwritten letter — explaining that I no longer wanted contact.

“This isn’t about one argument,” I wrote. “It’s about years of pain. I wish things could have been different, but they haven’t changed. For my own well-being and my relationship, I need to step away.”

Since then, we haven’t spoken.

What I find most interesting in all of this is that my mum genuinely believes Harvey made up the comment she said to him — that he “won’t be ungrateful anymore and try to kill himself again.”

But Harvey would never lie about something so serious, especially not that. It’s not in his nature, and it’s not who he is.

And even more telling — if his goal had ever been to make me stop speaking to her, why did he endure so much for so long? Why did he sit through those awkward visits, the uncomfortable silences, the cruel remarks and the passive-aggressive jabs? If he truly wanted us to fall out, he wouldn’t have needed to fabricate anything. He could have just pointed to all the real things she said, and actions that occurred, long before now.

But he never did. He never once asked me to cut contact. Even though, deep down, I imagine he wished I would.

Since then, I’ve cut contact with her entirely. Still, despite everything, I genuinely wish her well. I believe she will always carry a deep resentment toward Harvey and a lingering disappointment in me — but I stand by my decision. It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary.

All of this tells me everything I need to know about who he is — and who she chooses to be.

1kk5kyp,Just a random Sunday of ranting,Smart-Vanilla8943,"First of all happy mothers day to the GOOD mothers out there not the ones who abandoned you as a child and is now back in your life cause you've finally started making money, not the ones who physically, mentally or verbally abused their kids and  have finally decide to stop because they've found religion. Happy mothers day to the GOOD mothers the ones that were there from day  one the ones that spent nights with you when you were sad and depressed, the ones who listened about your heartbreak about that one boy who you thought you would've spent your entire life with. I want  to say thank you for those mothers the GOOD mothers.

The starting of my year  was shitty as any other year and the last  months have been roller coaster off emotions for me. First off i left my grandmother house and she took it personally as a vendetta  towards her that's fine she wasn't good to me in the first place anything she did was for her son as so that i don't die on her hands. My mother beat me up and i have the whole recording the reason being because i lent my boyfriend 20 thousand from my hard working money and i went to hospital for minor injuries and i wanted to run away probably would have if my boyfriend hadn't escorted me back to the premises, had a few bruises that were still there weeks after but such is life and i most definitely need therapy but until further notice i won't be receiving any. Which brings to today mothers day i have no love left for her nor my grandmother so of course my heart  is guarded away from them i wished my mother happy mothers day and  that is it no special treatment and i didn't wish my grandmother happy mothers day that is simply because i do not wish to have a relationship with either of them nor  do i want to be in contact with any of them.

I want to move out by the end of this year so i can fully take care of my mental health and my boyfriend is backing me up  for my decision because he has seen all that has been happening to me for the past year and a half and there's so much more that i want to adresss but its too much to get into to details...........

Our situation is we currently have a 3 year old daughter and I want one more but my husband is one and done. 

I’m 33 years old and I would like to avoid getting pregnant past 35. So time is on my husband side. 

Even though we stand on opposite sides of this subject I stand on my side torn 50/50 because I understand and agree with the reasons he wants to be one and done. So much so that he’s scheduled a vasectomy consultation twice and had to cancel both times cause I wasn’t sure. My desire for one more and my want to give my child a sibling are pretty strong despite the very logical reasons why we shouldn’t have anymore.

Its a classic case of heart vs mind.

We do have a couples therapy session set up for next week to help us navigate this decision.

1kk2b90,I [18W] don’t know how to deal with my mom,viyoooo,"Hey guys,
I (W18) have never written on here before but I am really frustrated right now. Today is mother’s day. I am in my last year of school and currently have my final exams. This week I had two big exams on Monday and Thursday, so I haven’t really been able to think about anything else. Nevertheless as soon as I returned home from my exam on Thursday I purchased a gift for my mother (W43)  (a perfume that I know she likes). Unfortunately it didn’t arrive in time. When I woke up this morning I immediately wished her a great Mother’s Day , hugged her, etc and told her that unfortunately my gift didn’t arrive in time. I had also reminded my younger brothers last week that it’s Mother’s Day soon, so that they would get her something but unfortunately they didn’t. Other than that I also have an older brother who doesn’t live with us because he’s at College. He and my mom had a fight last week and haven’t talked since. So when I woke up this morning she was already annoyed and in a bad mood, because she also turned sick yesterday. Throughout the day she freaked out and said really hurtful things. She also told me to return the gift because it’s unnecessary. When I asked her why, she told me that my dad already saw that no one got her anything and that he enjoyed seeing that no one appreciated her. They have a really complicated relationship and my mom has been through a lot. On one hand I feel really bad for not making her feel special and I understand that but on the other hand I think that she unnecessarily mean and shouldn’t let her anger out on all of us. I can’t deny that she might have some psychological issues as she’s really been through a lot but I don’t think this legitimates her behaviour. What do you all think?  What can I do to deal with her behaviour?",1,0,1746973758.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kk2b90/i_18w_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_mom/

1kk0gwn,My(41F) husband (50M) is taking the kids to visit his mom for mother's day.,NewspaperUnable5444,"My husband and I have been planning for him to take the kids to visit his mom. 45minute drive away for a few weeks now and it just hasn't worked out until this weekend. I have a strained relationship with his mom. So I prefer not to go. It also gives me time to clean without the house getting messy again before I can finish. (This is a separate ongoing issue)
Anyway I was 100% fine with this plan until yesterday afternoon.  I mentioned that I was feeling a little down about mother's day coming up. My husband said he totally understands.  
My mom is out of state about 12 hour drive. And I really don't have any IRL support. My side of the family is supportive but not local I have emotionally supportive friends online and also not local. 
I have a difficult relationship with most of my husband's family and they are more local.  
So I guess it just kind of hit me yesterday that I'm going to spend mother's day by myself cleaning. Again it was mostly my idea that my husband take the kids to see his mom for a day so I can get things done by myself.  So I don't want to show my husband in a bad light. Also we don't usually do much for mother's day or father's day. (His birthday is near father's day weekend so that is just a bigger deal to us)
My kids are looking forward to seeing their grandma I don't want to mess that up for them.

1kk05n4,I think I hate my sister?,sunnylikestostudy,"I’m not really sure what I expect to come from this post—honestly, probably nothing. This is my first Reddit post and I don't even know if I'm posting it to the right place. I just feel so overwhelmed and unheard, and I guess I’m just looking for a space where someone might understand and tell me its not all in my head and I'm not a big crybaby for feeling like this and guide me on how to make this treatment stop.
I (16F) have a younger sister (13F), and it feels like she can’t go a single day without bullying me. I’ve tried convincing myself that it’s just “normal sibling bickering,” and maybe we’ll bond when we’re older, but that hope gets dimmer every day. The truth is, I hate how much I resent her. I feel so guilty for feeling that way, but the more I interact with her, the stronger the hatred gets.

Looking back, this probably started when we were little. Our parents’ version of discipline involved me taking the brunt of the punishments, usually yelling and beatings, while my sister was apparently “learning” from watching me suffer. Same mistake, different consequences kinda thing. For her, just seeing me get beaten and cry was apparently enough of a lesson. But instead of taking it as a warning, I think she just grew up believing I was the mistake.
She learned to use that to her advantage. When our parents were at work, she’d say things like: “If you don’t do ___ for me, I’ll tell Dad you did ___.” And as a kid terrified of my father, I’d always give in. She held small things against me—like sneaking extra candy—for months. I’d get punished for stuff she made me do. When I finally told my dad about it, he just laughed. He told her, “That’s not a good thing to do,” and that was it. No accountability. No protection. Just me, still the punching bag.

Now the blackmail has lessened, but the emotional jabs haven’t. They’re constant. Little degrading comments that chip away at my self-esteem. I’m incredibly involved in school and extracurriculars. I’m in the IB program, French immersion, I wrestle for both my school and a local team, I volunteer, and I advocate for youth mental health, especially eating disorders. I leave home at 6:45 am and usually don’t get back until 9:30–10 pm. Meanwhile, my sister doesn’t even wake up until I’ve left the house and gets home by 4:30 at the latest.
Even with all that free time, she refuses to do chores, mainly the dishes. Then she complains I don’t help enough, and somehow convinces my dad I’m lazy and “living off him.”
She constantly ropes my parents into things. If I leave drops of water on the bathroom counter, she yells for me to wipe it, which my mom ends up hearing and I get yelled at. If I meal-prep with the last of an ingredient she wanted, she’ll call me fat (even though I’m not, but I was chubby as a kid and she knows it’s a sensitive spot). She mocks my intelligence. She insults me for no reason. And when I finally snap and say “shut up,” I get yelled at, not her.

What hurts the most is how cold she is. I say “I love you” to her almost every day, usually in passing, like “bye, love you.” She hasn’t said it back since she was too young to know what it meant. But she has no issue telling me she hates me, that she wishes I were dead, or that she wishes I weren’t her sister.

I feel like she’s breaking me. My self-confidence is at an all-time low. I overthink every interaction. I don’t start conversations unless someone clearly shows they want to talk to me because of how many times I’ve been shut down by her when I talked about something I care about. If I speak passionately about something I told to yap on and on, she’ll say things like, “Does your mouth ever get tired of talking?” Everyone laughs. I fake a laugh too. But inside, I just feel smaller and smaller.

I don’t like talking to her. I avoid asking her for anything. If I ask for a glass of water when she’s right next to the sink, she’ll call me lazy and walk away so she can say she's too far and since I'm closer I should do it myself. If I ask her to come back and close the door after she leaves my room, she pretends she can’t hear me. I know some of this sounds like typical sibling stuff—but it doesn’t feel typical when it’s every day, and when it’s so… mean.

She won’t even send me pictures of myself when we go on trips. I’ve had to sneak them from her phone when she’s asleep. One time, she left her phone unlocked on the table, so I sent myself a photo I’d been begging her to share for I think over a day at that point. She got mad and reached for her phone, and when I playfully held it out of her reach, she pulled on my hijab. In public. Exposing my hair.
I reacted. I pushed her away and slapped her arm. My dad saw that—and charged at me. He had that look in his eyes, the one that always means he’s going to hit me. It looks so hateful and I'm always brought to tears because how can you look at your own child like that? My aunt stepped in and stopped him, but by then I was already crying and just walked away. He later said he was only that angry because I’m a wrestler and should be “mindful of my strength.” But I always have to be mindful. I always have to hold back. She never gets told off for starting things, insulting me, or getting physical. I always get in trouble for defending myself.

I just feel hated. By her. By my parents, sometimes. They’ve done nothing real to stop her behavior. And I feel like such a pushover for letting it keep happening. It’s affected how I act with everyone—I barely speak up even with close friends. People think I’m mad or cold, but I’m just afraid of beingtld to stop talking or annoying people.

I know I sound sensitive. But that’s because I am sensitive. And when I ask her to stop, she tells me I’m “too soft” or “too emotional” and that I need to toughen up, to which I just walk away because crying or lashing out in front of her really does nothing but encourage her.

I feel like I'm overthinking this again and just hurting myself but I'm literally just so tired of feeling like a bad person or stupid or fat or ugly all at the hands of my sister. Am I really just overthinking everything and need to wait it out before it gets better? I'm starting to feel like I don't want her at my milestones like my high school grad or even my wedding because she doesn't bring the love and happiness I want to feel on those days. Do I need to have ANOTHER sit down with my family and tell them how I feel even though I know nothing will come of it? Do I just wait and move far away for university and cut most contact with her?

1kjul9b,Estranged Father Wants to be Invited to Christmas,PolarCrash,"Hi everyone, long time lurker and first time poster here - I'm in need of some advice while trying to work out my feelings and how to respond.

As the title reads, my father (P - whom I have not spoken to since I was a teenager) asked my mum (K) if he can be invited to our family holiday celebrations, starting with Christmas 2025. Due to my reasons for going no contact with him, I'm really unsure how to navigate this before the end of the year.

Backstory: My mum (K) met my dad (P) when she was 15 and he was 30. My grandma and grandad didn't like P, so mum (rebelled) moved out of grandma's house when she was 18 to be with him. They didn't last however, and P was already with another woman (B) when mum found out she was pregnant with me at 19. After a bad breakup, P and B didn't want the responsibility of a child so B threatened to take custody of me if P was included on my birth certificate. Mum was scared of B and left P's name off, and never asked for child support or any assistance from P and B with my upbringing. 

P and B broke up a few years later, and P started dating another lady (T). As I get older, mum remains in contact with P and eventually works for him as a store manager of his small business for close to 20 years. Mum has not dated another person, though I have a younger half-sibling from a one night ""accident"".

As a young child, I am repeatedly told not to call P 'dad', and to use his first name only. P didn't acknowledge me as his child, and both mum and P told me to keep it a secret from T that he's my father (tricky, I have always taken after P in looks). P often had his relatives come into the store, so this lie had to carry on there. Mum would invite P over to our house most weeknights, and would make me to go bed before he arrived - She would stock our fridge with his food and drinks she would prepare for when he came over. Once, I recall getting up to grab a drink in the late evening, only to find mum and P in her bed (small house, I can see into her room when the door is open from the kitchen). There are many other examples of both mum and P making me feel small and insignificant during most of my childhood. 

As I grew older I realised how infatuated with P my mum is... To her, he holds the moon! It did not seem to bother her that P didn't take an interest in me, treated her badly at the start, and has never shown one ounce of care for anybody but himself. The last time I spoke with P was 16 years ago over the phone, after he had an affair with B while he was still dating T.. I was the one who caught them in the back room of the shop. 

I am convinced my mum and P did not make good decisions as parents, and I have been trying to work through my feelings of resentment towards both my parents all these years. Mum is smitten with P, she wants him to be around more often and they are always texting each other and buying each other expensive holiday gifts. He asked why he was never invited to our family holidays (usually just me, mum, grandma and my sister), she replied ""well you've never asked to be included"". 

Mum asked me today what I thought about having him come along and honestly, I don't know what to say! I'm not that close with mum, but I don't want to stop her from having her best friend over for the holidays. At the same time, I can't shake feelings of being uncomfortable - He's never tried to reach out to me and he knows I'll be there. I don't know what I would say if he did reach out! 

What should I do? <3

I havent had a chance to talk to her about this yet but I obviously will. I just wanted to put all my thoughts out there and see if this is even a weird thing to want to do to begin with.

1kjsiyq,I don't know how or what boundaries to set with my parents :(,z9mbiez,"There's a lot to talk about here, but I'm going to try keep it as short as I can. 
My parents are very chaotic people, I spent my teenage years in foster care because my mum impulsively smoked crack one day lol. Even just saying that on its own, I'm imagining myself reading it as a stranger with no context and immediately thinking ""yeah, they are the problem"" but I just can't shake the guilt and possibility I'm the problem for not making an effort to keep everything together and be positive all the time. 

My parents aren't the typical alcoholic/drug abusing neglective type that come to mind. My mum suffers from a lot of childhood trauma, pretty sure my dad does too. My mum was a single parent, she held everything together for the most part but I just think she lacks mental stability to be a good parent. I don't think she understands what it means. She used to spoil me, give me whatever I wanted, and from what I can remember I lacked discipline as a child. Not completely, I was pretty well behaved but my screen time wasn't monitored, I've been told I was really difficult as a child but I believe I just wasn't being parented properly. I feel like I wasn't really seen as a human being? I don't feel like my mum really thought about my future much you know, or like, how my environment would shape me as a person. I was just there to be a child.
I'm getting kind of off track, I'm just trying to paint a little background. My dad on the other hand, is 10 years younger than my mum for a start. He was 21 and she was 31, even then I just think what the fuck was she thinking?? He is extremely childish in general for his age, has been in and out of prison countless times for petty crime/violence/anti social behaviour. He drinks a lot too. He literally acts like he has a mental age of 11-14, talking about ""hot girls"" and just failing to understand why he should conform to stuff because he just thinks it's a ""sheep"" thing and not because he's just being a bad person with no consideration for others. It sounds like typical narcissism almost, but to me I genuinely think he is stuck at a mental age where he hasn't reached the capacity to empathise properly. 

I am estranged from them but still have regular contact, I visit my mum once or twice a week and I ignore my dad most times he calls me but I see him randomly too idk its just so chaotic. I'm 19, I'm trying to go to uni this year and live as happily and comfortably as possible. I am so sick of the instability my parents have given me, both emotionally and physically. My mum still struggles from an addiction, she's been fighting it and does well for months but falls back again. Even when I don't live with her, it causes me distress and I notice my personal relationships and routines start to strain because I am anxious and stressed from the lack of support and honestly, betrayal. It still affects me. But I struggle to cut her off because she is just struggling with mental health and vulnerability, and I don't exactly want her out of my life at all I still love her I just get so hurt from her decisions still.

And my dad, his presence is just problematic enough. The stuff he says, his lack of capability, the things he says about my mum TO ME, he is so destructive. I just feel guilty also because even though he's much worse than my mum, none of it is intentional?? He genuinely has no fucking idea what he's doing? I just feel bad because they're both clearly mentally ill with no family support and they don't even understand how much this hurts me. My mum gets defensive when I try to say something, and I honestly haven't even bothered with my dad because I really don't think it would lead to anything useful.

I really don't know what to do. I feel pathetic almost because I feel like my feelings are inferior to them? Like, I'm not sure why but I just feel like they would think I'm being sensitive or bash my reasoning. Or me cutting my mum off would just cause her to deteriorate even more, and it would be all my fault because I was being a baby about feeling sad when she relapses. Idk!! I just can't keep repeating this involuntary cycle anymore. I actually don't know what I'm asking for here anymore LOL, some advice I guess!!! Or even reassurance. I don't trust my own feelings much, it's helpful to hear from somebody else whether I should just ride it out or not.",5,1,1746937216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kjsiyq/i_dont_know_how_or_what_boundaries_to_set_with_my/

1kjr4ef,How do I tell my mom she ruins everything,motherpanda22,"I (27f) don't know what to do anymore. Months ago my brother (43m) and sister (45f) planned that this Mother's Day weekend we would go as a whole family to a Detroit Tigers game, for them it was a gift to our mom cuz she took them a lot as kids (notice age difference, completely different childhoods). 
It was supposed to be me, my husband, my brother and his gf, my sister, her husband and 2 kids, and my mom and dad (their step dad). Well my parents relationship is bad and basically they are married roommates who hate each other, but that's a different story. 
My mom didn't really want to do this trip but it was a gift to her so she was-WAS- gonna deal with it. 
Fast forward to today. I was gonna host my parents at my house (I'm about an hour from Detroit) for the night so we could have a big breakfast and then go to the game. Well first off my mom texts me how much my dad is pissing her off before they left. Then when they get here she doesn't say a word to me, she instantly starts yelling at and about my dad. Then she realizes she forgot her fucking purse (3 hours away). So shit hits the fan, she can't take some fucking responsibility for herself, blames my dad for ""rushing her"" and ""stressing her out"" and says she's going home. 
 Meanwhile I had asked my brother to go get her purse (he lives by them), but she didn't care. She left, went home. Leaving my dad here with us (not a big deal he can go home with my brother tomorrow). 
I start sobbing a few minutes later after I stop being stunned. She doesn't give a fuck that her kids were doing something for her. She didn't give a fuck that I bought flowers and cookies and other goodies for the weekend. I had a big breakfast planned tomorrow. The whole 10ish minutes she was here was just anger. 
Now I hear from my brother (who called her) that she is not coming tomorrow. The whole weekend is FOR her. For Mother's Day, and she's bailing. 
She can't taking any accountability for her actions. She can't admit she's wrong. She ruins everything. How do I put my foot down and tell her she hurts everyone and ruins everything. I can't fucking believe this (yes I can, this isn't a new thing for her), but ffs. ",2,2,1746932261.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kjr4ef/how_do_i_tell_my_mom_she_ruins_everything/
1kjqjpd,I ruined mother's day,vickeyhh,"TW: physical abuse 
I (22F) went to a pizzeria with my sister (27), brother (29), and mother (49) for Mother’s Day. I’m not fond of going out, but it was a special occasion. At dinner, my mother wanted individual pictures with each of us. She took one with my sister first, then asked me to pose. I bent awkwardly to be at her level, but she decided it wasn’t right and skipped me to take a picture with my brother. When I finally sat beside her for a photo, she wasn’t happy and wanted me to move again, but I refused. This led to a tense exchange, and my mother started complaining that I treat her like my absent father. (She often compares me to him negatively, especially during conflicts.)

When I told her to stop bringing up my dad, she got upset and went to the bathroom, she came back crying and said she was leaving. My sister followed her, and my brother and I went home. I expected her usual silent treatment, but things escalated when we got home. While I was changing clothes, she forcefully entered my room with a hard plastic hose and hit me, saying I needed to learn how to treat her. My siblings intervened, but not before she hit my thigh and wrist, breaking my bracelet and causing bruising.

I backed away, and then was told to go to my brother’s room. My mother continued yelling threats and insults, saying I’m manipulative, a snake, and worse than my father. She said she would come to my job and embarrass me. While hiding in my brother’s room, I cried and considered if I could afford to leave. I went outside to not listen anything else she said until my brother came to find me.

He helped me clean my cuts and stayed with me in the living room. He reminded me our mother has a history of mental illness, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Still, I don’t think her actions were justified. I was raised in a home where hitting was common, but I thought that had ended. This felt like the fights she used to have with my father.

I know I wasn’t perfect that night—I was annoyed and resistant—but I didn’t deserve to be physically attacked. I feel like I’ve always been the outlet for her stress, unlike my siblings. I hate that I was treated this way and that it mirrored trauma from my past.

1. Our wedding was 3 years ago and we have a baby on the way, why is this even a topic of conversation?

2. She said “I didn’t know what it was but I was drunk and took it and it didn’t do anything” — maybe the important question is why you’re takin pills you don’t know what they are? 

3. My husband is not a pill guy, he can barely swallow Advil and hates taking any pill, if you’re going to pill sh*t out of your butt at least make it a believable story.

4. I am IRATE about this. I’m in the middle of planning her bachelorette party and helping with her bridal shower, and I’ll be in her wedding 1 month postpartum. Where is the gratitude?

5. About a year ago she texted me a photo of her and her fiancé organizing a bunch of pills by color. I still have this photo and text message, I can happily scroll back to get a screenshot. I’m mad enough to want to send this to her mom to prove the point that she is indeed the problem, not my husband.

1kjpi2g,Why am I being held responsible for how my younger siblings dress?,Simple_Operation7054,"
So I’m 22 and been living at home while I finish my last 2 terms of nursing school I have left and it has been rough being here. 

I’m honestly frustrated. My mom constantly tells me that what I wear isn’t appropriate and that my younger siblings are copying me. But I really don’t think I dress badly or overly revealing. I usually wear maxi skirts, maxi dresses, and yes, I do wear crop tops sometimes, but my overall style leans more toward a boho aesthetic. What I wear fits me well, and while I may have a slight bit of appeal, I don’t think I look provocative,I just happen to have curves that I can’t exactly control.

She told me she’d prefer I wear more flowy blouses, looser pants, maxi skirts that aren’t as fitted, crew neck tops, less jewelry, and less makeup. But the crazy part is she wears super tight tops with cleavage out, tight clothing in general, and even shorts where her butt is literally hanging out. There was even a time I wore a maxi tube dress, and she told me I looked “naked,” but a couple of weeks later she wore the exact same style dress,except hers was wayyy shorter.

On top of that, I’ve noticed some of my clothing has gone missing, and I’ve seen that she’s been stealing and wearing my clothes. And because she’s bigger than me, my clothes end up stretched out. I even found some of my things hidden in a bin. When I bring it up, she just says, “I’m grown,” and reminds me that when she had me at 20, she had to change the way she dressed because she had a daughter watching her.

That makes no sense to me, bc she has two other daughters , but somehow I’m the one who has to change? And honestly, I don’t think me changing my wardrobe is going to stop them from wanting to wear those things anyway. I think it’s more about their friends and what’s popular at school, but when I tell her that, she keeps blaming me and it’s really starting to piss me off.

On top of all that, she keeps making comments about me buying things for myself, and how she couldn’t do that because she had me. But I don’t constantly spend money or splurge, I buy what I need, or occasionally treat myself and keep up with my maintenance. And it’s not like I don’t help out around the house either, always pitch in when needed.

I’m just tired of being made out to be the bad influence when I’m really just living my life, minding my business, and not even doing anything extreme.

1kjnpn3,What am I doing?,Low-Thanks-4316,"I've been staying with my mom and her adopted daughter for almost three months. My mother and I never really got along except for when I tried to build a relationship with her after I got pregnant with my first daughter. I felt that in order for me to have a relationship with my daughter I had to build a relationship with my mother. That backfired because my mother not only stabbed me in the back, but she also took my daughtet from me. I have always felt like my mother wasn't a good mother. 

Now I have proof of it and I can't let her do that to the one daughter she pretends to want, but if it wasn't for the money, she wouldn't be doing it (taking care of her). And to be honest, she doesn't even take care of her. My mother basically takes her to school (and she only does it because she knows she'll get in trouble if she doesn't). Just recently she stopped making her breakfast, and she is constantly fighting with the poor girl. For whatever reason, and it's all the time. 

Just this week she had an open house at school, she wasn't planning on going because she knew my mother wouldn't take a day off of work to go with her so she asked me if I'd go. Me and the babysitter had a fun time taking her. This is my point. According to my mother, if she stops going to work she says she'll go crazy so she pays a babysitter to watch the her. My mother is 77 years old and she refuses to leave her job (its not even a career). In my eyes, that is a form of neglect. 

Yeah, she pays a babysitter, but what makes it neglect is that she doesn't worry about what her daughter eats. The babysittet either brings her food or takes her to get fast food. So far I've been a couple of weekends with them and my mother doesn't do anything. Granted she is 75, but damn what about her daughter. Oh, yeah, just this month I went and bought her shoes. My mother denied that she needed any and then she tried to say that the girl didn't want any shoes! For real? 

That lady gets the girl's SSI money that she started collected after my father passed away. AND she gets $900+ for the girl after qualifying for some program because she was adopted. I don't know why everybody else is so blind to her fake ""love"" and how fake she cares about everyone when she could care less if you make less money. I haven't been working (according to her) for years. All if a sudden I need a job to help pay rent.

That's hilarious, she is just jealous because ""I'm not letting her be a mother to her daughter."" She doesn't realise what she says because when its convenient for her ""she could be \[your\] my daughter if \[you\] I want her."" Then she is reminded of those checks and she's back to being her mother again. The poor thing hears her loud and clear, so now the girl tells me what my mother tells her and I understand the girl since my mother hasn't changed. She's treating her like she treated me and I feel like the little girl is in danger.

Danger in the sense that she will rebel and my mother won't do anything to stop her. Thank God she is a good girl, but her innocence could get her in trouble as well. So what am I doing? I don't know. All I know is that before I even decided to come here, I prayed on it, dwelled on it, prayed some more on it, read ths scripture, and God sent me here. There is no doubt on my mind, but now my doubt is - what do I do?",1,0,1746920920.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kjnpn3/what_am_i_doing/
1kjnhnn,My father doesn't give a sh*t,Primary-Slide-9961,"I, 30f is living now with my father and mother. I moved back because financial and couple issues. My father 65m, is an alcoholic, and it worsened over the years. Hes drinking before, during and after work. Not to mention, he steals from us,(hes acting like money grows on tree), the law sentenced him for drunk drive.
Fyi, hes soon retiring.

Little story for the beginning.
We have a twinhouse, the smaller belonged to my greast grandfather and the big to my grandmother. When my great grandfather left, my grandmother wrote the big house to my father and she moved to the small one, our current house. He was engaged that time, she cheated, and he broke down, sold the house for a shitty car and a flat that collapsed. He moved back to his mother and still live here. 
I still cant belive how idiot was he, he had the attitude at that time and now to 'live for the present', doesn't think about the other day. 

Back to me,
I have my savings which i hid in my room. I check sometimes and make notes how much i spent. Not long ago i checked my savings and almost the half had gone. I checked and the math doesnt added up. I left it. After that i saw him in my room, i didnt though much about it, he sometimes gave me my clean laundry, open the windows, stb. My mother, 58f, around that time asked me if we can speak. She asked help to count her savings and it didnt matched also. Almost 3 thousand was missing. He was unemployed that year, he doesnt need to take care of anything. We knew if it was him. I told her my money was missing too. I banned him from my room and locked the door everytime, me and my mother got a safe. After that, jewelry, euro change dissappeared. That happened years ago too, for the record. He doesnt give a sh*t and pretend he didnt steal it. The audacity. Sadly my grandmother died back in 2022 and the house is in his name, so we cant make any move to lock him out of our life. 
He will go into jail for 2m in this moth for drunk driving, no one was hurt luckily. I think he deserved it, maybe he will have a different perspective. But theres the what if something terrible might happen during drunk drive, i know these risks but him..absolutely not.
Hes alcoholic, liar, irritating, lazy, gaslights, doesn't care if he's live or die. His attitude is irritating, doesnt do anything to change or do something about it. I seriously want to hit him in the face sometimes. I said at some point i dont care if he leave, in that way, maybe we could get some piece. I know, im assh*le but if he doesnt accept help, i give up on him.

Now the arguments are so annoyi g and much that we considered the thought to sell the house.

I'm not joking when i say that she decide to yell and demanded that her appointment should happen in the moment she got it because she doesn't have time to lose (Yes, she is new money if you haven't noticed yet and yes my dad provides this lifestyle for her). 

As someone who entirely life has to deal with her, i have to try to calm her, apologize to everyone and stop the situation but it was horrendous and i think was my dead end.

My husband works full time and is present/active with our kids when he’s home. We live in a multigenerational home and pay rent for the floor we reside on (mostly for the help/support we need with the kids). My brother also lives/rents in the basement floor. 

Monday - Thursday I’m up at 6am to get the kids breakfast and ready for school; I get my oldest on the bus to school, then drive my youngest to ABA. Then for 3 hours I clean, run errands, and make lunch for the kids. Then pick up my youngest from ABA, go to my oldest school to pick him up, we drive all the way back to the ABA so my oldest can have his sessions, and then rush to get my younger to his preschool. Once he’s dropped off for 3 hours I finish running errands, cleaning, and prepping snacks and dinner. If my husband doesn’t get forced into mandatory overtime he’ll be home early enough so the both of us can go pick up our oldest for ABA, then once we’re home with wait for my youngest bus to drop him home. If my husband does have overtime he’s not home till 630p, and he does step in and do everything he can to help with the kids and their routine.

Friday - Sunday I work from 3am-12p. on Friday’s the kids don’t have ABA or preschool, my mom helps me a lot. She’ll get my oldest on the bus to school, and watch my youngest till I’m home. She’ll also watch the kids on the rare date night, or extra shifts. My husband’s usually off Saturday and Sunday, and will do the bulk of the childcare, but my mom will watch the kids till I’m home if he has to do overtime. 

My parents are the only support we have in this state so I don’t mind helping them anytime they ask; I take my mom weekly to Costco and any shopping she needs/wants, any tech support help they need. I help with trips they need planning, password resets, bills/customer service calls, applications, household chores, pretty much whenever they ask for help I help. 

My younger brother and I used to be close, our relationship strained/fractured when his weed use got so intense he was constantly screaming at me and my mom. Our relationship really broke apart last year after he crashed his truck a second time; we told him that he needed to cut is marijuana usage down, no working/driving while high, no screaming at us.

He never cared at how much inconvenience we had to do for him; my dad let him use his truck and took my moms car, and I was responsible for getting her to and from work while still juggling my responsibilities. 

He was paranoid that we were doing things to make him mad; he thought we kicked him off the wifi when it was him that removed himself when he was trying to set some VPN on his phone (my husband fixed it for him even though he was so aggressive and awful to me). He took every loud sound the kids made as a personal attack on him, that we were trying to ruin his sleep purposely making noise (we do the best we can to limit noise and correct the behavior, but they’re still special needs kids that have no impulse control with stomping and kick). We can’t talk about anything around him without him either trying to condescend us or starts to get aggressive. His aggression and verbal abuse got to the point my husband stepped in months ago and told him he needed to stop or get out, but screaming at me and my mom was not accepted. My dad even ended up with a screaming match with him because he kept cussing at my mom. 

Around earlier this month my husband and I apologized to him for telling him leave, due to how how often he was screaming the backyard and everywhere about “how dare we try to kick him out his own home”; and my parents requested we apologize to see if that would bring some peace. It did for a bit, but instead of obsessing over that he started searching for new reasons to scream and yell.

My brother isn’t responsible; he was fired from his job for his aggressive behavior and drug use (he was driving while high, and operating machinery while high). 
He won’t take care of his space or any shared spaces; constantly leaves him clothes in the washer and it was me that used to move his laundry or fully do his laundry at my mom’s 

My brother leaves his floor so dirty that my mom has to go and clean his floor; throw out garbage because he won’t do it, do his dishes because he’ll leave it till it molds, puts his clothes away bc he won’t, clean his bathroom because he won’t even clean his crap stained toilet. 
He still will pick fights and scream at her, but my mom protects/enables him, when my dad tries to kick him out or argue with him my mom is the one that’ll stop him, she’s also the one that still asks me to do his laundry if he leaves it in the washer. Even when we do his laundry he will leave it in the garage for weeks until someone (mom) takes it to his floor and puts it away from him.

Right now my parents are on vacation overseas visiting elderly family; when they were leaving our washed died. I was the one that bought the new washer, set up the installation and removal. I let everyone, my brother included, know that the washer was not be used (we even unplugged it and moved it forward) that the replacement would be and ready for use later that night. He decides that’s the day he’s going to be proactive and replugs in the broken washer and starts washing clothes right at the start of the delivery window. Inevitably his clothes stay soaked bc the washer is broken; I let him know he can either take his clothes to the laundromat to dry, or if he wants to use the dryer he has to set a 45 min timer and come back to restart the dryer. He snaps at me that he’ll just come back in 3 hours to do his laundry and that he’s going to leave his soaking wet clothes in his fabric laundry basket. I told him he can wait if he wants, but his basket can’t be in the garage (because he won’t clean up the giant puddle his clothes are going to inevitably make); he starts yelling and arguing, I’m firm that I will not allow the clothes be in here. He storms off to his truck, reverse so fast and hard he almost falls into the ditch snd flips me off as he speeds away.

Originally I did put his clothes outside the garage, but at my mom’s request I put them in the dryer and dried them and flipped his fabric basket to dry in the sun. Around the time I get notified the delivery is going to be there in 20 min I go out to move the cars and wait for the delivery he’s out there calling our parents to complain that his laundry basket his upside down, since I’m already out there and annoyed by his behavior I tell him your clothes are drying and your basket is drying. He starts yelling at me that he’s not talking to me and ordering me to go inside. I tell him I’m in the space I need to be, and he slams the phone an inch away from my face screaming at me that our mom told me to go inside. My mom and dad both scream through the phone that HE needs to go inside. He storms away screaming at them through the phone. I complete the delivery, dry his clothes, and then take it to his door and leave it there (at my mom’s request).

Last couple days since the incident, we’ve been trying to stay away from each other and if we do see each other we do not speak but he doesn’t glare and mutter something towards me. We’ve seen on the ring camera of him leaving and coming back inebriated. This morning I was leaving for work and saw that his side of the garage door was wide open, on the cameras it doesn’t show him walking to the front. But does show the door was open around 845p and stayed open till I closed it at 3a. I can’t say for sure he purposely opened it, it’s possible he pressed the button from his home on accident and just never closed it. But it upsets me a lot, because my homes entrance is through the garage. We have so many tools and expensive equipment that could be damaged or stolen, and I’m thankful nothing happened; but I hate that it was left open and now I have another thing on my checklist to take care of to make sure we stay safe and secure.

I’m just exhausted. I want peace, I don’t know what to do to bridge the gap or what I need to do for him to be more responsible. I don’t know if there is anything, he will always throw in our face how we react to him, but never acknowledge what he did. He won’t apologize, he’s never thanked us for anything we’ve done to help him, so I know an apology is never going to happen; on the rare moments he’s not a jerk he acts like everything is normal and that we’re the bad ones for still being upset (which leads to him getting aggressive and argumentative). 

My husband wants to do a giant family meeting this Saturday after my parents get back to discuss the behavior, and have an intervention. But we’ve had interventions with my brother before, he’ll half listen, make empty promises and then continue the behavior. 

I don’t know, thank you for letting me vent. I’m so tired between my family and work, but I can’t if I don’t stay stepped up no one else will step in.",1,1,1746896122.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kjetmb/i_think_i_just_need_to_vent/
1kjd8o3,"hello, it's my first time here on Reddit. I have something to share and I am asking for some advice that can help me with this.",Cultural_Budget1346,"I'm a Filipino, 2 parents, 3 siblings. For context, my brother wants to pursue senior high in a private school that he's been in for at least 12 years. Now he had 3 options, which were labschool, a public school, and the private school he was from. Me, him, and those other two options, which were the labschool and the public school, and my parents were discussing about it. When we've brought up, what if he transfers to the public school, it was an automatic no. This night, I've brought it out to him that we weren't in a financially stable lifestyle despite that he has been in private school for 12 years or so. We live in a 2-story house, we weren't lavishly rich, we can afford basic necessities, but work was slow, he didn't understand it, because ""going to private school = a good college resume"". I tried to talk to him through it, yet he wouldn't budge. Tuition per semester in that school was P15,000, he said it was 'cheap' but he doesn't even work for it. He demands for things he want; food, gadgets and wants. I was a bit disappointed knowing that he doesn't understand the situation, yet again I tried talking him through it, he got furious and bursted out crying because we were ''invalidating what he wants'' knowing my parents were on the verge on sacrificing every piece of energy they had to find ways to afford food and to try selling items, and valuables. Yes, we can't force him because he will be the one going to school, but what infuriated me, was when he said that ""If I don't go to private school, I will leave this house and go away from you guys for not understanding what I want"". I left the room where we were discussing this and now I am here typing this prompt. Please give me a piece of advice that can help me with my situation.

1kj8z3h,Just blocked my mom ( TW- abuse mentions ),Dry-Produce2347,"There have been a lot of issues in our relationship, mostly because of her toxic relationship with her boyfriend (her AP – affair partner).

She tends to brush things off and pretend everything is fine, even after the physical abuse, the cheating, the lying, and the way he broke our family apart. Despite all of that, she keeps going back to him. It’s really strained our relationship, especially since I despise cheating — and she knows that — yet continues to lie and act like nothing happened.

Last year, I got kicked out. I now live with my gran because he (her boyfriend) couldn’t handle me calling him out. All I said was that he could’ve picked up a dirty nappy, since I was already busy taking care of my siblings and half-sibling. He blew up over it, and I couldn’t stay in that house anymore.

It’s been almost two years now, and their relationship is still toxic. I made a joke once, and he overheard it — then went off the deep end again. This was just a month after he kicked my mom and siblings out over something he imagined. And yet, she still took him back.

I’ve done my best to stay respectful — I don’t talk to him at all — but now I’m not even allowed to come over to see my siblings because my presence “makes him uncomfortable.” Meanwhile, he makes me uncomfortable. I’m just tired of it. I blocked her. At this point, I don’t care how she feels.",2,0,1746879615.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kj8z3h/just_blocked_my_mom_tw_abuse_mentions/
1kj72cs,My sister constantly judges me and mocks my choices — I feel done with the relationship,Princess_Cat_4316,"I’m 24, and my sister is much older. We live together (for now), and our relationship has become so one-sided and hurtful that I’m honestly done trying.

I’ve always supported her. I listen, I don’t judge, I stand behind her choices even when they’re messy — because that’s what family is supposed to do, right? But when it’s my turn, she tears me down. Every time.

Recently I did a photoshoot — nothing inappropriate, just something creative and empowering for myself. (wanna become a model so building my model portfolio) She flipped. Accused me of blocking her (I didn’t, my account was private), told me to delete the pictures, and started mocking me like, “You want to be a model now? Go get used and thrown around, right?”
She literally said things like “you dress like a ho” and compared me negatively to our brother, saying he would never embarrass the family like this.

What makes it worse? She does this with a smile. Like it’s a joke, or “just the truth.”
Even when I told her before, “if anyone bothers you on Instagram, I’ll block them,” she threw that back in my face like a weapon.
And when I share dreams — like wanting to be a florist or a hairdresser — she’d laugh at them, only to claim them later as her own ideas like she suddenly wanted to be that.

She constantly acts like she knows who I really am, better than I do.
And it’s exhausting.
I try to ignore it, but I’m deeply sensitive — she knows that — and she still acts this way.
I’m planning to move out soon, follow a study path or just start working and build my own life.

But the pain of being judged by someone you’ve always stood behind — it really cuts deep.

Anyone else have a family member, especially a sister, who just… chips away at you like this?

1kj0rqn,My sister has never been to a single major event in my life,Pleasant_Ad_6943,"My (25F) sister has literally never been to a single major event in my life. I am about to graduate from law school, and she will not be attending my graduation party nor my graduation. I can’t help but feel like she doesn’t love or support me. 

There is always an excuse .. 
 - My 8th grade graduation, she was upset with my mom and didn’t want to go. 
- My high school graduation she got upset that she overslept and I didn’t wake her up in time to my make up, so she didn’t go. 
- My high school graduation party, she was traveling 
- My college graduation she “had Covid” (in quotes because I’m not sure if this was ever proven, I didn’t even inquire). 
- Now, she  can’t come to my law school grad party because she “has to study for finals” and won’t be attending my graduation because she claims she can’t get off of work (even though just started this job last month, and could have told them before accepting the offer that she would need the day off (or at least half the day) to attend a graduation)

I think this is the last straw. This in addition to a host of other things she constantly does, I think it may be time to remove her from my life. I hate it because it would mean not being in my nephew’s life, and I have a really hard time cutting off family members.

Any advice? Am I over reacting or is this really wrong??",2,1,1746847332.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kj0rqn/my_sister_has_never_been_to_a_single_major_event/
1kiyzsz,Am I holding a grudge or do I need to let it go,Middle-Photo-8537,"So I’ve never done one of these before… and I’m trying to determine if I’m the asshole or I’m not trying hard enough. Here goes (I’m not using any names!!) My partner and I have been together a long stretch both of us raised by grandparents ironically we bonded over dead moms and shitty dads.. my family are pretty standard mom died, dad got a new family didn’t really bother with us again not relevant to this though so moving on my partners parents both herion addicts… dad always been buzzing round him during childhood did the whole shitty addict parent thing since we’ve been adults we don’t have anything to do with his dad. The issue is his mom my MIL I can’t help but hold a tonne of resentment towards her. Here’s why I’ll start from the start. So my MIL had my partner when she was 15/16 when he was 2/3 I was always told from his nan (on dads side) that me day she knocked her door pretty much said I don’t want him anymore and left… his dad years later told him she’d died and he grew up believing she was dead his nan raised him. Fast forward to us having our first child together and we get a knock on the door surprise surprise it’s partners dead mom… apparently she’d heard she’d had a grandson from my partners dad and she was getting clean and wanted to build bridges… took us by shock beyond shock. My partner wants to give things a go (understandable at the time I didn’t know what to do or say I’d never ever been in a situation like this before I had a very standard very as you’d say normal up bringing almost sheltered I knew nothing about addiction!) I did however have my guard up because I wanted to protect our child you know just incase. My partner very overwhelmed with his dad crawling back in his mom turning up I think a lot of trauma got brought up and he had a mental break down, police got involved and it meant for a period of time he couldn’t live with us and regrettably ended up living with his mom who he’s known was alive for 3 months and who’d only been clean for 3 months for the first time in 17 years. While he’s living there she continues to stay clean and her and I formed a very good bond almost I guess you could say it was too much, we almost saw each other every other day did everything together she bonded really well with my child was really proving herself and we were supporting mentally being there trying to be there for her in anyway we could she got back in touch with her mom and dad her were young so they were great grandparents to my child but really more like grandparents. It was working it was odd but it was working. I think I clung to her in a sense because I didn’t have my mom and I think she did the same because she just needed someone. About six months in she started seeing this man and decided she was gonna move in with him partner still on bail had to go with her. Things were fine there for abit she was still on methadone and then the partner that she was with was an alcoholic a functioning one had a ful time job worked hard kept his home etc but drank a lot. MIL while still on the methadone also started drinking at first just a little bit then it started to get out of control, she would go on these benders and go missing for days literally wouldn’t here off her sometimes three days sometimes ten days like the boyfriend she was with would lock her out she would break into the house to get in, in the end. Then after Christmas of 21 she went out on one of her benders and just didn’t come back she was back on the gear and that was that. I’m just going to mention that while she was drinking she was not a nice person not a happy drunk I mean she was a cruel nasty drunk. My partner works and she’d come back sometimes at 2am I’d have him phoning me crying because she’d come in drunk and started on him even hit him start fights with my partner her son, she’d start fights with her boyfriend the one night he thought they’d both died because she threw her and boyfriend downstairs the stairs it was like this almost every night for 4 months until partner came home. My partner went to court and charges were dropped as it was deemed what he needed was mental health support rather than all the crap. Great he was home life could get back to normal. The following Christmas we found out we were pregnant with our second child around the same time we bumped into MIL ex boyfriend who’d told us he’d seen her she was on deaths door and would be lucky to last past Xmas… this sent alarms bells off in our heads and for a few weeks we went back and forth on weather to reach out… we did (I’m still debating weather it was one of the worst decisions of our lives) so we reach out my partner text her. That night I couldn’t sleep I phoned her I was on the phone three hours basically saying don’t bother messaging partner back if your just gonna hurt him again swore blind that wasn’t the case. Two days later we went and met her (without our child just incase) she said she was trying to get clean again anyway before she reached out to us but didn’t wanna live this life anymore, so we said right Ok let’s really rally together let’s do what we can let’s get it right this time it’s not gonna be a straight line but we can do this together… we actually got closer then we did the first time she was down to be my second birthing partner obvs partner was first… like we got really close and I think we both relied on each other too much ( I was doing the things with her I couldn’t do with my own mom… I think she was over compensating even though we kept saying she didn’t need too just baby steps) Towards the last trimester of my pregnancy she started seeing this bloke that was still an active addict and she started drinking again but it didn’t affect us as partner wasn’t living with her we just knew she was turning up to us with black eyes or not hearing off her for days again… she was still on methadone, and started going on benders before patterns started to repeat we sat her down and said look if this keeps on your gonna go down the same rabbit hole and your gonna loose everything you’ve just built back up we all had a cry including her and she said yep she can see what we mean and she definitely thought that this bloke she was seeing was bad news as there were constantly drinking fighting each other and it was altogether a toxic situation. She asked us please not to take her off the birth plan… I was hesitant but I kinda thought maybe just maybe this would like cement things for her to get her really on track to be like you’ve just seen your grandchild come into the world like come one you’ve got this… this is special you know? She attends the birth. Things started to go downhill, there was first little things that she kept saying like “I could do this I could have another baby” we thought nothing of it at first thought it was a joke. After having baby I was very very sick I ended up back in hospital and she’d keep on with all these promises and they kept falling through and then she came to the hospital two black eyes all cut up… she’d been with this new addict boyfriend fighting and drinking again… we straight up said nope nothing doing this again we’ve jus thad a baby im too sick to be dealing with this we know where it’s going we backed off abit we didn’t cut ties we just were focusing on us our new addition and me getting better. In the end a fight broke out and we did cut contact well between partner and MIL. I kept in touch just incase like I was routing for her to pull through and sort herself out. Christmas 23 I get a text “can you tell patner I’m pregnant due in May”  I read it I literally thought wtf😳😳😳 we worked it out she literally got pregnant two weeks after I’d had our baby! Coincidence..🤷🏻‍♀️ Partner was heartbroken I mean like I obvs had to tell him he came back from work literally broke down crying and said how could she do this… don’t get me wrong she was his mom by blood however to him he always said she was more like a friend not really his mom… she isn’t a very maternal type if you get my drift. We don’t really have any contact for a while then she reaches out to partner and they try build bridges. I am completely against it however it’s not my mom I can keep my children away from it which I did and have done they don’t really have anything to do with her but I’ll get on to that in abit. So she’s pregnant we start seeing her again abit and we find out the boyfriend she’s pregnant by the one that’s still an active user we aren’t sure 100% on details but it turns out that the whole time she’s been pregnant and we’ve seen her pregnant she’s been drinking still on methadone and fighting. (Please don’t ask how she hid the drinking during the pregnancy I don’t know, it never got picked up no one has ever been involved with her social services wise nothing) she turns up to our eldest birthday party 5 days before her due date can in one hand fag in another, everyone drink counted her while she was there because everyone was completely gobsmacked even us and it was about 9-11 pints she had… and as I stated before she’s not one for just having one she tends to go on benders after and I’m bit of a believer in patterns repeating. Fast forward she has the baby… normal birth heathy baby Sod’s Law I actually dunno how she did it with how much she was drinking. She ends up moving to a flat within a five min walk from our house everything is fine for abit she isn’t seeing the addict boyfriend until all of a sudden she is and then it turns out she’s drinking constantly and fighting with him all the time, she says she can’t phone the police because there’s warrants out for her arrest. He says she’s doing drugs she says he’s a liar. She lies about having him round because her parents said if she does they will wash her hands of the situation… because there’s a child involved (and she lies about it because when I say her mother literally buys everything for that child I mean everything) she’s drunkly said to me she’s drinking all the time she’s finding motherhood too much and combined with constantly having the addiction boyfriend there then not there drinking fighting it’s just another cycle. We keep our distance, it’s difficult for us because our children are very bonded to MIL parents, my partner’s grandparents so we kinda have to keep the peace because they are under the impression that MIL is sober clean and not doing anything risky so to speak and I can’t blab because in all honestly I’m a little scared of them they aren’t ones for sitting down and talking finding the middle ground and conflict resolution they are more ignore the problem until it becomes a huge problem and explodes into utter chaos and if you question there might be an issue you get shut down and told to mind your own… so reaching out isn’t really an option. I just make sure that my children are protected and kept away from it which they are my eldest who’s old enough to remember MIL doesn’t really bother with her when we do have to see her, and my youngest hasn’t really got a clue who she is… My question is I suppose I’m a being the asshole because I feel I’ve given chance after chance, tried to be there give support (I’ve kept things brief because it’s so long anyway let alone if I went into every little detail) because I can’t help have this unbelievable amount of hate towards her, to see how much she’s hurt my partner, he’s such a good soul he really is and she has just shit in him I mean for example since having her new baby she doesn’t bother with him at all like not even the odd text even when we have to see her she doesn’t bother even trying to have a conversation it’s just constantly trying to shove the new baby under his nose and then get his approval that she can be a good mom? Which I find insulting to him after what she’s repeatedly done to him… I also have hate that like now it’s all about her new baby or nothing like my children get completely pushed out the way and shoved to the side which I’m not jealous of the new baby its more how she goes about it she literally told me that my youngest is forgotten about because she’s the “middle child” ours if the three of them my eldest my youngest and her new baby… which I just is shitty! I just don’t know weather I’m holding on to grudges and should cut her some slack or if I’m justified and should set fire to the whole fucking thing because the idea of when I next have to see her boils my blood! I know this is long but I’ve been holding this in for nearly 5 years and believe it or not this is brief and leaving out alot of details.

I’m 22f- me and my roomates recently found our other roomate dead Monday, May 5th. He stopped responding to everyone on Saturday, May 3rd. I was in contact with his family, urging them to file a missing persons report. We ended up getting worried and recording under his door and saw his keys, shoes, and backpack causing understandable worry. We thought he had left town to visit his friends a couple hours away or something. We climbed onto the roof and punched in the bottom of his ac and saw him just laying there. He took 14? Bottles of pills. So pretty f*cking traumatic. 

-I don’t think there’s any more TW after this- 
This is my grandmothers response after she found out. At first my grandmother messaged my sister the thing about drugs then I messaged my grandmother privately telling her that wasn’t okay. Am I not being as cordial and like as lenient and understanding as possible? Can anyone explain why they think my grandma reacted like this/ did this to begin with? I know we have some Psyc people in the crowd. Otherwise thoughts, comments, concerns all welcomed.

1kivn9f,Getting Embarassed and Beat up With Your Own Money,Firm_Contribution868,"So quite a few years ago when I was a teenager. My older brother started messaging this woman that was way older than him, she was about our moms age and one of our moms friends. So, eventually she sends him some pictures of her naked and he returns the favor. This ended up causing a huge fucking ordeal as you can imagine. And my brother being a fucking idiot contiunes to message her when he wasnt suppose to . And tells her a dark secret of my mothers that nobody was suppose to know. For reason Im still trying to figure out. Whether it was a dead child trying to be covered up or receiving cheques that she wasnt suppose to from the goverment. She's been trying to make me mentally retarded. Seriously. Shes been trying to give me severe brain damage. Even going as far as to telling relatives that she want to put me into an assisted living home when I was 25. I did and do not belong in one. When she had this idea I was pipelining, pipefitting, working everyday. There was no need for me to be in there. She also did have a Power of Attorney she made up as well so you can see where this was suppose to go.  But she would bribe friends to hold a pillow over my head during sleepover and shit like that.  So my brother must have told her this secret unless there another dark, twisted one I dont know about yet. This woman then blackmails my mother, flipping the entire thing around and if Im correct she gave her something like 10,000 that was put away for me. Constantly getting the shitty end of this stick.  Fast forward to now they have blown through probably everything at this point. All at my expense. They pay people to embarass me, try to beat me up. They have made an entire game out of it. Ive been homeless and they have bought people camping trailers, everything.

My brother would make status updates on Facebook and if you would rearrange the letters in them it would spell a task on what you should do to me or embarass me. Then if you uncscrambled it and did it then you would get a reward. He still has cheques of mine at home. He will also deposit them  into accounts and then let them sith there until they go unclaimed and sent to the Bank of Canada whre he will then claim them. Im also pretty sure they have my ID and have been collecting all sorts of cheques from me, depostiting them in there where they have no fear of anyone questioning them. All they did was got an excoworker that barely could pass as me to go in and create the account. He got his downpayment on a house payed for. They have been fucking me over for years now.  I dont give a fuck.  They both deserve to be put in jail for a long ass time.  They have been filming me for years, setting me up for shit , anything they can do to be collecting a box full of blackmail material.  Idont care if you family at this point I'm ready to end their fucking lives.  Nobody in town will help at all because theyve all been payed or they believe all the shit they have said about me.  Fuck Brenda, that bitch threw me in a garbage bag and in a dumpster when I was 3 months old and shes been cutting off my circulation ever since.

1kil2b4,"Dad role, need advice.",AccordingPie9806,"I am father of two girls, ages 6 and 8, and my wife is currently 7 months pregnant. Since I started my relationship with my wife at age 20, I knew I wanted three children. During these first eight years of parenthood, I have been absolutely happy and completely satisfied. I always felt fulfilled and content. I never had any negative thoughts about having two daughters, even knowing all the things I couldn't do with them (I've dedicated my entire life to soccer, for example).

Since we learned the third baby would be a girl, I have had a strong feeling of disappointment that, five months later, I still haven't been able to overcome. It's deep and lasting; I'm afraid it will turn into depression. What hurts me most is a profound feeling of rejection. It's as if I've always been part of a family unit and now I've been expelled or rejected from that unit. I see myself as outside the group of four of them. I see myself as different. I see my wife as 100% compatible and agreeing on everything, but I'm, let's say, 50%. My wife can talk to them about how she did things as a child, she gives them her childhood toys to play with, they share clothes... I see that everything I do now has no meaning. This gives me a deep feeling of inferiority to my wife and makes me feel small and insignificant. I feel like I have to do all my hobbies alone, away from my family. My hobbies and I go one way, and my family go another, and we'll never be able to coincide.

I even feel punished by nature or by God, because they don't want there to be a continuity of me. I know that my daughters are my daughters, but I see how if a woman has 3 daughters and I have none, because they are like a photocopy of her.

I have even come to feel like I hate being a man. I feel like it's wrong my whole masculinity. But it's only because I see that as the reason for my exclusion from my family of 4 women.

I am very sad and have no motivation for the future. I have always been a strong and determined person, I had my life plan very clear until now. But now it is the opposite. I don't see where I can get the satisfaction I had before. And I know that parenthood is not about satisfying fathers and mothers, but about providing children with all the love and affection they need. But I have to watch soccer by myself at home, in another room. I try hard, but I don't manage to share hobbies with my daughters... they only want dresses, make-up, ... and these things that I respect, but I don't know anything about. When we go on a weekend trip, it is very humiliating for me because I spend the whole trip in clothing and jewelry stores, holding the bags by myself and waiting for them to finish. I'm like their accompanying servant who doesn't matter.

I am deeply envious of all the male parents who have male children so they can have company and give continuity to their life, their experience, their hobbies and interests...

The one I envy the most is my own father, because he has always had a very impacting and excessively heavy role in my life (sometimes for good, sometimes for bad).

People I know, friends, etc... all make joking but deeply painful comments to me... One person even said to me: “I sympathize with you” (the expression you say in Spain when someone in your family has died). Just for the fact that I had to live with 4 women for the rest of my life. Also my wife told me “Dad needs a dog”, and that hurts me deeply because it means just that, that I am not part of her group and I need another companion. And if she says it, it hurts me even more.

I guess I didn't know it but I had an expectation. And now when it hasn't been fulfilled, it's very painful. I always wanted a big family so I wouldn't feel alone. I now feel very lonely and pushed out of my own family. And I also want to say that I have a huge guilt for not being 100% happy, and for seeing my wife endure the whole pregnancy and not me. I would say as well that there is no sexism on that, I have always been more feminist than my wife is.

I am very happy to have a third baby, and I know I will love him and have no problem with the 3 girls personally. But I can't stand the place this situation puts me in and all the things I have to give up.

Has anyone gone through anything similar, any suggestions for improvement? Any opinions for the purpose of improvement would be appreciated",1,7,1746803921.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kil2b4/dad_role_need_advice/
1kikjk2,I miss/hate(?) my little sister.,Irisflowerfs25,"Hi, I came to Reddit solely for the fact that I desperately needed to get this off my chest and maybe to hear what others think of it.

My little sister is growing up. 

I am aware of this. I made peace with it. I made peace with the fact that the sister whom I hated would grow up, hate me for the shit I've done to her and involved her with, lose the spark in her eyes, and maybe not consider me as her family anymore. I've made peace with all the negative outcomes that will come back to bite me in the ass. 

But no, I guess I was wrong. 

She still loves me; she told me herself. That should be a good thing—but it's not. How could she love so easily? I hate it. Is she doing this to make me feel even more guilty? Does she know what I think of every time I look at her and realise, 'Fuck. Are you really my family?'

I want to start out like this and I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense. English is not my first language.

Let's call my sister Betty (just a nickname as the rules say).

Of course, obviously, I am the firstborn of a father who's a trash junkie and a hardheaded mother who worked her ass off as a waitress. Again, obviously, nothing good comes out of raising me when my parents are like that. 

And Betty is the youngest.

The first time I laid my eyes on her (Betty), my mother in the bathtub, my father probably somewhere fetching towels, I had been filled with some sort of distrust. I wasn't angry. Nor was I disgusted. It... Felt off. I didn't know what to feel—it's just so confusing.

Betty wasn't the favorite.

None of us were the favourite because we received equal treatment, although a little less extreme when it came to her because she was the youngest. Not that I minded. I wasn't jealous. I knew I deserved it because of my actions when I was still a teenager—that included me having to be at parties, making out with my boyfriend, stealing money from Mother's old leathery purse, and trying what my father did because why the hell would he care? If I had a kid like that, I would've made the decision of quitting on them, but how would I know? I don't have a kid to begin with.

Anywho.

Betty was always kind, sweet, but not naive.

She knew that what was happening isn't what you call the way to 'parenting'. Or something. I don't know.

Sweet young Betty did what she could to make it less worse for me.

When it came to me having to be locked in the basement with only the trash bags and the old shit my grandma stored in there, my younger always made it her mission to take care of me without having to let our parents know. I, being the angsty teenager that I am, would always cuss her out and shove her out of the basement, but it wouldn't work. Betty was stubborn.

Each time, she'd sneak into father's room and grab the key to the basement.

It's 50/50.

But mostly... Not so 50/50, because before she could even deliver me the canned food or whatever she had on her hands, Father would wake up and slap the hell out of her. How do I know? Betty's cries were much louder than my own hands banging the door, begging to be let open.

I was a bitch.

She wasn't.

She followed me around like a lost puppy, showing me the cool rock she found somewhere in the backyard, giving me pennies that she saved up when I was trying to find some money for one stick of cigarette (to which I would gladly take), and food—she'd give me food. And in return, I'd swear at her, push her away, and if I wasn't really in the mood—I'd hit her.

But she just bounces back up like... Nothing happened to her.

...

I don't remember much anymore.

It's blurry.

I was drunk, and I knew it was a warm night. I remember that I packed my things and probably gave the f-bomb to my parents before slamming the door in their faces. I swore to myself I'm never coming back to that hell hole.

But one thing I remember most was when Betty gave me her jar of pennies. I said that I don't remember much anymore, but this one really stuck in my mind like a damn parasite.
 The jar of pennies she gave me is probably somewhere in my room, hidden away, not a penny wasted.

I stayed at my boyfriend's house (bless his heart; until now, I don't deserve him), and his mom... Surprisingly liked me, kept telling me that if my boyfriend weren't her child, she'd love to have me as her own daughter. We made a small business together, now booming thanks to my boyfriend's mom helping us out. The both of us managed to get an apartment together—and I continued to pursue my studies, courtesy of my boyfriend's mom too. (I love the both of them.)

It's been years.

I haven't really thought of Betty much.

I was only reminded that I had a little sister when my phone gave me a text notification.

I'm not sure if I should post it, but to be safe, I'll just copy it out and still use my sister's nickname as Betty and mine as Nora (which is also my nickname):

(""Hi, it's me Betty;) It's been a long time! How are you? I don't know if you will actually see my texts but I wish u can. It's been a while. I actually miss you, hehe. I just wanted to let you know I'm still alive and kicking. Okay that wasn't funny. Haha. Not my point. I'm basically talking to myself here now jeez. Again not my point. I love you Nora! Pls take care of urself, hugs and 😚😚😚😚"")

Theres more.

Theres more of it.

And then... Something in me I just snapped.

I talked to my fiance(yes, now fiancé, not boyfriend), and again, bless his heart, he understood me when I said I wanted to go alone in this one and I would give him updates every 5 minutes. I made the decision to visit my sister.

...

I really hate this.

But the house hasn't changed ever since.

Like time just stopped the day I left.

But not Betty.

No, Betty grew.

And I hate it.

Betty actually grew.

But the fuck did I expect? 

Did I expect the sweet girl that clinged to me wherever I went still be the same? I mean... She's still the same, except, less optimistic. Or maybe that's what I'm thinking? I don't know.

It was awkward.

Terribly awkward.

But it was my fault anyway.

She did most of the talking.

She had told me that mother and father are out somewhere, on their little mini vacation.

I... Really don't want to say anything anymore.

I don't even know how I got to this point, but Betty invited me to her piano concert or something. I didn't know she played piano and could sing that well. I didn't know she was THAT fucking good. Out of all the people that sat and watched her, I was the only one who didn't clap. Many people cheered for her in the back. And as she went down the stage, her friends, to what I assume, came running at her and almost tackled her to the ground.

Even in the midst of all the cheering, the hugs, and the kisses on her cheeks that came from her friends, she stared at me.

She smiled and waved at me.

It was sad.

Her smile was so sad.

Like she was glad that I was here.

I vaguely remember waving back at her, but never returning the smile.

Only then did I realise that Betty actually made a life that I never witnessed. When I should've been there to defend her from a bully, taught her how to do her hair, given her some make-up that I owned, been protective of her when she had a date, given her advice on how to deal with her cramps, and been there to comfort her with her first break—it had all been dealt with by someone who knew better and had actually been there for her; worse, she dealt with it herself.

That night, we went to a crappy Chinese restaurant.

My treat.

And that night was the most she's gotten comfortable enough to snort at the dry jokes I made, talk without restraint, and give me some of the food she didn't want. That's a lie. There's not a food Betty wouldn't like. 

We came home that night... Or... I don't know, just walked her there.

I made a promise to my fiance that I would be back home.

I always keep my promises.

I didn't miss the look of sadness that made its way onto Betty's face, and I just wanted to turn my face away and ignore everything. For some reason, I was the one who initiated the hug. She wrapped her arms around me. She told me she loves me. Betty told me she understood that I have my own life now and how I shouldn't worry for her anymore. 

That's all.

I went back to the apartment and cried in the shower.

I hate her.

I hated her for making me feel this way.

Everything was perfect and she had to ruin it.

I thought that the mistakes I made were already gone, and yet, Betty climbed her way up to the top and laughed at me.

She shouldn't say that I shouldn't be worried for her anymore.

I hate her, fuck I really hate her.

I love you, Betty. But you made it hell for me. I shouldn't have been your sister. I shouldn't have to burden myself with the thought that you found someone in replacement of me. I shouldn't have gave you that hug. I shouldn't have come home.

I hate how we look like each other so much.

I hate how you are the version of what I am if I just knew better and didn't let my thoughts get to the better of me.

1kigrpm,I feel like my family doesn't care about me.,bubblegumwow,"Backstory: I'm 19 and I currently live with my dad, stepmum, and stepsister (16). My mother passed many years ago so it's been just me and my dad for about 5 or 6 years. And then my dad met my stepmum dated her for like a year or 2, and then they got married last year in February. Eight months later in october, my stepmum and stepsister moved in with me and my dad into a new house.

Onto the problem; me and my dad always used to hangout like go out to a movie or go out to dinner or go hiking and it was very fun. But now it seems like all of his attention is only on my stepmum and my stepsister. He's the only working parent and he gives them both money all the time which makes sense. However it feels like he's stopped caring about me. He doesn't ask me about university or care about what I do really. All my parents' attention is on my stepsister, investing into her hobbies, her school trips, her hangouts, and all they talk about is getting her into university (which won't be happening for another 2 years). I have a job but it's casual and I don't get to work that much because of uni, and they (my parents) don't like helping me with money anymore?? Anytime I ask for something like fuel money because I'm having money troubles they say to just buy it myself. They even forget to text me or ask if if I need anything when they go grocery shopping?? Like, I'm not exaggerating when I say they don't buy me anything. They don't care about me getting into uni or what I want to do in uni?? They don't even invite me to go shopping or go on trips with them (they go on little trips like every day or every other day).

I literally feel like a foster child they don't like or something. They don't treat me terribly or anything they just pay no mind to me. And my dad thinks I'm lazy and don't do anything when I study my ass off and try to please them by helping out with chores all the time. They also bought my stepsister so much new expensive furniture and just random room decor she wanted but they don't even want to buy me a new DESK even though my furniture is actually 12 years old and is in shambles.

They are also talking about moving away to a different city when my sister graduates highschool, and she's going to go to university in our city probably, but they literally won't talk to me about what I'm going to have to do? Like I don't have that much money I'm just broke college student and they want to move away and leave me here to just start somehow picking up $400/week worth of rent for a tiny uni lodge room.

I'm wondering if I should say something to them? I don't usually talk to my dad about personal stuff like this(not anymore at least). It just feel like he only took care of me before because my mum loved me and he loved my mum, and now it feels like he only cares/takes care of my stepsister because he loves my stepmum.

I feel like I sound a little spoiled here which I'm not trying to, I try to never ask the for ANYTHING unless it's a little fuel money or just to remember to buy me groceries that I actually eat. We're not poor or anything so it's not like they have money troubles. I sometimes feel like I'm overreacting but I know that I'm not. This situation is making me feel depressed because it feels like no matter how hard I try in uni or in anything else they just won't care.

And although he doesn’t mean to it hurts and it makes me triggered to feeling like a scared little girl. Well something happened and he got frustrated at me and started yelling and I completely shut down. I wanted to go to my room and cry and go home. My step mom noticed and she said he’s human he just gets frustrated easily but I she totally gets where I’m coming from. She encouraged me to address it. But I’m non confrontational. I asked her does she think it’s weird that when my dad addresses her it’s always calm and soft spoken but when it comes to his daughters he’s quick to get angry and yell at us. The 10 years they’ve been together it’s like he acts like a different person towards her. She said he doesn’t talk to her that way because 1. She would never allow it and 2. She’s his partner not child so there’s no comparison. Idk how I feel about that, he knows yelling at me is a big trigger for me because he used to do this when I was young and I still get scared just like when I was younger. What’s a good way to address this or should I just get through the weekend?

1ki9svr,My sister wants nothing to do with my mom but my mom doesn't understand *help and advice needed*,Subject-Self-2241,"We are family of 4 kids and a mom and dad. My mom and sister (13 y/o) have had a bad relationship for years. It started when my sister was young (6-7 y/o). My mom would say something trivial like ""clean your room"" and my sister would say no. This went on for every single thing in the house no matter how small or miniscule the request was. My mom, after my sister would say no, would then yell and try to make her do it. This happened to all of us kids whenever we said no to what mom asked us to do however with all of us besides my sister we would just do the task when she yelled. I know yelling at your kids is bad and my dad tried to make my mom understand this, but my mom was brought up in a Russian household with parents who had escaped the Soviet Union so this is how she was parented. Anyways, my mom would yell and my sister would keep saying no and yelling back and finally (this is the first time) my sister hit my mom. Then my mom got even more mad and continued to yell and then slapped her once and yelled (the hitting only happened like two or three times and it was always just a slap, never a beating). My sister was, in the beginning, was no different than any of us kids. We were all yelled at and occasionally hit. But she was stubborn and continued to say no and basically made herself the bane of my mom's existence. Today basically the same even occurred but afterwards I decided to talk to my sister and mom to get both of their separate perspectives. My sister said she doesn't was a relationship with my mom and doesn't respect her because she hit her. My mom just doesn't understand that she needs to back off and slowly repair things (even after I explained her Pov). I just don't know how to explain to my mom and my sister that they need to both try to fix it and I don't know how to make my mom understand that she is a big part of the problem and that she is the one who has to change. My mom doesn't really listen to me cause I'm just a kid (I'm 16) and my dad is not very emotional and doesn't understand how to be sensitive enough to explain my mom's flaws. Both my mom and my sister are very emotional and sensitive and stubborn. I mainly need advice on how to get my mom to listen and understand and fix it. I really just don't know what to do or how to handle this without losing my mom and sister or potentially my mom and dad (they have fought as a result of parenting discussions).

My mother( I think 60F) was very involved in my siblings and my life growing up. She quit her job for it. So the entire time that we were growing up she was super involved. She made us study, made us meals, and cleaned the house when we were younger.

Recently, which I would consider since I started high school, she has not been involved in anyone’s life. None of my siblings, nobody else in the family, nobody. She is overly into political videos and all she does all day these days is talk about whatever she heard on those online shows I guess. Now, I AM on the opposite side of her political beliefs. She is HARD HARD right and I am like in the middle but if anything closer to the left. During these past years she has been following people like QAnon and other related creators, believing every single word they have said. My dad used to be like that but clearly with the state of the world right now something isn’t working out, so he’s even started leaning to the left or at least against Trump. She isn’t even a citizen so I don’t even know why she gives a fuck about anything.

Throughout all of this my father has been treating her normally, and he is a big gift giver. He is always thinking about what treats she wants and stuff like that and he confided in me earlier today that he is sick of my mother’s behavior and how her entire personally has become promoting these republican channels. He thinks that by treating her normal and getting her treats she likes is reinforcing this behavior. My dad cooks, is the only working person in our house as all the kids are in college, and continues to think about all of us throughout all this time so I’m agreeing with him that it is really unfair that she just sits around all day watching this republican bs while he provides for everyone. 

My dad and sister have been talking to me about the state of my mother for some time while I moved away for college, but now that I’m back for the summer and seeing severity of the situation. You cant have a normal conversation with her without her spouting some weird pro trump nonsense and it’s really affecting the lives of people in my house. 

What could I even say to her that’ll make her realize that she really isn’t doing very much around here these days?",1,3,1746756807.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ki7lnd/should_i_tell_my_mom_off_and_calling_her_out_for/

I (15TM) live with my mom (31F) and my uncle (25M). My uncle works at night, so I understand he’s tired, but I’ve literally seen him playing games for like two hours before going to sleep. Meanwhile, I’m cleaning the kitchen because it gets messy so quickly. I cleaned it just two days ago, and it’s already a mess again. I’m the only one who seems to care about it, and it’s getting overwhelming. My mom is really tired from work, so she doesn’t make the messes, but she’s not stepping in to help either, Which I suppose is fine because she’s the one with the most responsibilities

The bathroom is another issue, though it’s not as big of a deal. I don’t go in there often, but it’s annoying having to see the toilet seat up and his stuff scattered on the counter.

I’ve already talked to my mom, and we’re planning to have a conversation on Sunday about some issues in the house. She doesn’t know it’s about my uncle, but I don’t know how to bring it up. I don’t want to make her feel like I’m attacking her, and I don’t want things to get worse, but I really can’t keep cleaning up after my uncle all the time.

How can I approach the conversation with her? I just want things to be more fair. I don’t want to start drama, but I really need things to change.

1ki4bmr,My younger brother (22) is claiming I’m a pervert (25),Confident_Boat_1029,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to vent about this situation that happened to me just recently because I don't know what to do. 

I’m a 25 year old Mexican woman, & I live with my mom (my parents divorced back in 2019) & two younger brothers. I’m the eldest, the second is 22 & the youngest is 20. 

My brother, who’s 22, let’s call him A, has always bullied & belittled me for years. I think it started when he began high school, he would bully me constantly about my weight (I’m on the chubbier side but since then I’ve lost weight), looks, personality & just basically anything about me tbh. He does this to my mom & sometimes to my younger brother but he mostly does it to me & my mom. 

He’s always made fun of fatter women or fatter people in general, but it’s mostly towards women & always makes comments towards random overweight women he sees out in public, usually making fun of their appearance.

My brother didn’t graduate high school & dropped out, but eventually got his GED years later. During those years in between he did nothing; he wouldn’t take showers, just played on his PS4, bullied me & my mom etc.

I know this could be a sign of depression or some type of mental health issue but whenever my mom or I would try to talk to him about it he wouldn’t care or acknowledge it, & even would respond by saying cruel or mean things to escape the topic.

As of lately, things have gotten worse with my brother. 

His favorite thing to call me now is a “pervert”. Claiming that I am one whenever I try to give him a hug or show any affection towards him, (like patting his back or ruffling his hair playfully.) He hates physical contact or affection from me or my mom or pretty much anyone. 

He makes weird remarks when we’re arguing like “oh I know what you do in your room, I watch you through your window”, or “oh I read your dairy, I know what you’re doing/saying.” And at first I’m thinking, he’s saying those things to just make me mad but what kind of normal brother says that to their only sister???

So this morning, my brother was in my grandma's bathroom, because me and my grandma share a bathroom since are rooms are next to each other. Apparently my brother was using it but I didn’t know, I had thought it was my grandma, she’s hard of hearing, so I was lightly knocking, because it was early in the morning, it was 8am or 9am, and sometimes I do open the restroom a little bit, because she's fallen asleep on the on the toilet several times before or she can’t hear me in general unless I crack the door open a bit to speak into the bathroom. 

All of a sudden my brother is hollering that I’m a PERVERT! And I’m like, why didn’t you say anything when I knocked??? I was literally jiggling the door knob around! But he just kept hollering that I’m a pervert & I just told him to “shut the fuck up” & I went back to my room to wait for him to get out. 

He gets out & I’m able to shower & get ready for school ( I go to college.)

When I came back from school, my brother, A, is already on my ass about something stupid, & then he starts calling me a pervert again. 

I’m FED UP, so I go to tell my mom, “hey, your son is literally calling me a pervert, he's claiming that I'm trying to see him in the restroom, because if you're calling me a pervert, it's because you're claiming that I'm doing something perverted, like as if I'm trying to watch you use the fucking restroom.”

And you know what my mom does? Instead of telling him, “hey what the hell is wrong with you, why are you saying that to your sister?”

She starts lecturing ME, she starts calling ME a weirdo, she starts telling me, “oh, you don't do this in the house, you don't help me.”

Mind you I’ve financially supported this family after she & my dad divorced since I was 19, because she’s an immigrant & can’t work. 

And I'm like, “how are you gonna lecture me! I’m literally telling how inappropriate your son is being to me!” But she doesn’t care, and just turns everything on me, & doesn’t tell my brother anything! 

I seriously cannot imagine my friends’ brothers saying these things to them. Like what is this behavior???  I tell people, I tell them the way that he is, I’ve even told my therapist, and everyone says this is clearly not normal! 

Yet I am the scapegoat, I am the black sheep, I'm the one my mom is gonna lash out on and lecture, not my brother, just me. I honestly do not know what the fuck to even say or do anymore. This is constant.

I’m trying to move out, but I live in CA, & it’s just so hard.

I just feel so alone, & ashamed. Ashamed that this is my family. 

I’d appreciate if anyone could spare some advice or comment their observations. Hell maybe you’ll even relate, but anyways, I’ll just leave this here. ",3,3,1746746625.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ki4bmr/my_younger_brother_22_is_claiming_im_a_pervert_25/

1ki00mv,Feeling left out,No_Individual_1092,"My husband (M 40) and I (F 37) have been married for two years. When we first got together, we hung out with my in laws a lot. His twin brother (M 40) and his wife (F 30) live about 30 minutes from us. We see them regularly and I’ve always enjoyed their company. They recently had a baby and it’s the first grandchild between my husband and his brother. They’re aren’t many cousins or younger kids in the family so this was a big and exciting time. But it’s also when I noticed a shift in how I was treated by my brother in law and his wife. Our conversations feel forced. Any time I bring up something baby related, they talk to me like I have no knowledge about kids. Now, keep in mind, my sister and my cousins all have kids. I’ve been around babies before. I may not have kids of my own, but that doesn’t mean I’m clueless. 

My mom has told me to just let things go and eventually they’ll see that they’re not the only parents in the world and are not perfect. I’ve tried but it’s been hard. I do keep my mouth shut whenever I hear them say something ridiculous pertaining to their child or if somebody else’s kid is not quite up to par with theirs. I’ve started skipping visits with them because I just cannot stomach another forced or uncomfortable conversation. 

I also have yet to see the baby wear clothes I’ve bought or even a toy being played with. So far the only toy I’ve seen him play with that I bought was a large rubber duck. Other than that, nothing.

I’ve stopped buying him gifts outside of his birthday and Christmas. If my husband sees something he think he would like, I tell him it’s up to him if he wants to buy it. 

And yes, I have asked my husband if I did or said something to offend them. He of course tells me no and not to overthink things.

1khpz86,Should I Hate My Parents?,kim_sunz,"I won't say my real name (personal reasons) but you can call me Alli. I'm 11F. My mother, Shei (not real name) 36F and my father Jos (not real name) 46M are strict parents. But sometimes, they get on my nerves and act so bad. I have a little brother, 8M, Ron (not real name) who's spoiled. We don't always get along. He's spoiled and rude, and I just ignore him and give him the attitude he gives me. But when we fight, we hit each other. And it's very unfair. When HE hits ME all he gets is a stern look and warning no matter how hard he hits me. But when I hit HIM, I get scolded for not understanding that's he's just a child. Which I guess is understandable. I'm 11, so I should already know what's right and wrong. But seriously? he's 8. He should already what's right and wrong. And when I hit him, even though its so soft, he cries so everyone sides with him. And my parents only see the bad side of me. Now to my father. He has a big ego. He is a big short tempered man-child. He doesn't use his own feet and hands to do stuff. Always asking me to do everything for him even when my little brother is with him. I hate him for it. Yes, I know you had a tiring day at work, but even switching the lights, and closing the door should be done by me? even though your in that room? even though my little brother is also with you? He constantly nags me. To the way I dress to the way I cough. It annoys me. He only focuses on my imperfections to make himself feel good. Whenever he's with his friends, he always tries to make fun of me to get them laughing. So, should I also say how you've been wearing the same shorts for weekd now? How you screamed at me for not doing what you asked me the second you said it? Now to my mother. We get along. She's nice. But she comes from a poor family and constantly uses it as a reason that I should already cook, clean and do everything she does. Ok, I know I should clean. I know how to cook. I know how to do what she does. But I'm only 11. Do you want me to have a stroke? You are a 36 year old woman. I'm an 11 year old girl. What do you expect? A five star meal and a spotless bedroom? grow up. And just because you were always taught to respect your elders, doesn't mean you should say it over and over again. I admit it, I'm rude and sarcastic. But I only do it because YOU do it to me. You've always said, what other people do to you is what you do to them. And I'm doing exactly that. She's always saying I look like skin and bones. That I don't finish my food. Ok, I DON'T! Because you put big amounts of food I can't even digest properly. And you expect me to gobble it all up like you did as a kid? I'm sorry. But no. Just suck it up and deal with it. I can't say this to them because they don't take me seriously. I can't scream or let out my anger since they always think I'm disrespecting them. I tend to silently claw on my hands just to get the anger out. Now please tell me.

1khk70c,How do I reconcile with an abusive brother who’s now “doing well” but still feels like a threat to my peace?,HereToHaveFun-,"Hi Reddit,

I need some honest advice and insight. This is hard to write, but here goes:

My older brother was abusive to me in early childhood—some of it was intimate in nature, between the ages of 4 to 6. I’ve carried that silently for years. On top of that, I was bullied a lot growing up.

Strangely, from around age 10 through my late teens, my brother and I grew closer. I think I was clinging to any sense of family or connection I could get. But during COVID, when I really needed him (we were housemates then), he abandoned me—left me to clean up, pay off rent, and sell everything in the apartment. No proper goodbye, no closure, just gone.

He’s now in a new relationship (my partner and I both feel off about his girlfriend, though it's hard to explain why). Suddenly, he’s making good money after years of being broke, even borrowing from me and my parents in the past. Now he’s paying for our parents' dinners, fixing their car, and playing this “good son” role.

He’s reached out before, claiming he wants to rebuild. But every time he’s done that, he’s overstepped boundaries, minimized the past, or ignored my attempts to explain how I feel.  
However, he has heard my words and is now not pushing as much because it would upset me that he didn't listen. Now he only calls if he needs something and doesn't push.  
He does hide his work information from me though although everyone in the family knows what he does.

Part of me wonders if this new “generous” version of him is just an act because he finally has money. Another part of me is asking whether it’s possible (or even healthy) to reconcile at all—especially given what happened when I was a child.

Has anyone gone through anything remotely similar? How do you know if someone truly wants to change, or if you’re being pulled back into a toxic dynamic just dressed up with nice dinners and gifts?

Any help or reflections would be really appreciated.",2,3,1746689104.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1khk70c/how_do_i_reconcile_with_an_abusive_brother_whos/
1khfke7,HELP mom wants me to change college i committed to,fatima_35308,"Hi, I’m a senior who has already committed to a college (college #1) and I want to go there, it is 4 hours away from where I am. However, due to that distance my mom doesn’t want me to go to that college and instead wants me to go to a college that is much closer (college #2)and that I can commute to daily because she doesn’t want me to dorm. (Her reasoning is that I have no need to dorm because my older sister goes to college #2 as well and commutes just fine everyday). she is also against college #1 because of the private loans i would have to take out IN MY NAME (listed below).


Even though the may 1st deadline has passed she wants me to email the college #2 and ask them how i can proceed to go there even though the deadline has passed (she knows she can do this because she did the same thing to my older sister). I need her permission to do a lot of things like hang out with friends and stuff because i live under her roof and she is still my mom and she keeps on holding my college situation over my head. Is there anyway i can reach out to college #2 just to appease her even if i have no intention of ever switching from college #1 to college #2? Who should I email for that and what should i entail in the email?


Financially;

For College #1 I would be taking out AT MAX 12k a year in private loans alongside the subdivided and unsubsidized loans that FAFSA offers. I would be taking these out in my name and i’m fine with that.

For college #2 I wouldn’t be taking out any private loans aside from the subsidized and unsubsidized loans that FAFSA offers. However, there is no way that i am going here.



Edit: I get where my mom is coming from because of the way she was raised, her desi culture, and the fact that we are muslim. I feel very guilty for not listening to her because she gets emotional over it and cries and i cry too because it’s so stressful for me. However, i would really like to get away from my family situation while i’m in college because i cannot deal with it anymore.",2,5,1746671806.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1khfke7/help_mom_wants_me_to_change_college_i_committed_to/

1kh1mcd,My sister forged legal documents to take our parents' home and assets—I'm struggling with what to do next...,Gypsy-Soul-0687,"Last year, both of my parents passed away—my mother from stage 4 cancer and my father from dementia/Alzheimer’s. They were in and out of hospitals and nursing homes, heavily medicated and given poor prognoses. They never returned home due to the severity of their conditions.

During this time, my sister didn’t want them back in the house. Instead, she began moving her own family into our parents’ home. She took over everything—claiming to have Power of Attorney (POA) and a Lady Bird Deed. She never let me see the documents, denied me any input in their care, restricted visitation, and controlled all financial matters.

Recently, I obtained a copy of the Lady Bird Deed and immediately noticed my father's signature appeared to be forged. My attorney suspects fraud as well. I submitted samples of his known signatures alongside the one on the deed to multiple online verification services, and they all came back with the same conclusion: it’s not his signature.

To make things worse, the notary who signed the deed is a close friend of my sister’s, and it appears she may have forged the signature herself. The two witnesses listed on the document are also friends of my sister.

From what I understand, this could be considered a second-degree felony—for the notary, the witnesses, and potentially my sister. I know the legal grounds are strong, and I want to seek justice not just for myself, but for the memory and dignity of my parents.

But I’m stuck. I keep thinking about what people—especially extended family—will say if I move forward with filing forgery or criminal charges. I’m afraid I’ll be seen as the one ""tearing the family apart,"" even though the damage wasn’t mine to begin with.

I feel so conflicted. Has anyone here been through something similar? How did you move forward? What helped you make peace with your decision?

1kh0ptg,"[Legal Advice] Father Taken by Police Again – Ongoing Family Conflict and Harassment, Need Guidance",sole_of_the_deep,"Hi, I’d like to stay anonymous.

Our family has been dealing with continuous conflict involving my father and our relatives who live next door—specifically my aunt and her son (my cousin). My father has a drinking problem, and whenever he's intoxicated, arguments often arise between him and our aunt. Sometimes it escalates verbally—recently, he allegedly told her to fix her things and “get out,” which led to yet another complaint to the police.

According to my sibling who’s at home, the police just took my father in again. In a past incident, my cousin claimed that my father threw a toolbox and threatened them with a saw, although there was no physical harm. My father, while intoxicated, also exchanged harsh words with the women involved. We're unsure what exact charges might be filed or how serious this could become.

What’s making things more difficult is that my cousin is very confrontational—he once challenged my father to a fistfight and refused to resolve things through proper channels. I have a voice recording where he was clearly instigating violence. We feel harassed and unsafe in our own home, and we’re strongly considering moving out as soon as possible just to protect ourselves and avoid further issues.

We currently don’t have the financial means to relocate immediately, but we’re desperate to find a peaceful solution.

My questions:

1. What charges could potentially be filed against my father in this situation?


2. Could we take legal action against my cousin for harassment or intimidation?


3. Is it possible to seek help from any government agency (like DSWD) for relocation assistance?



Any advice would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.",1,0,1746632966.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kh0ptg/legal_advice_father_taken_by_police_again_ongoing/

Crying while laughing at the same time during my online graduation (grade 6). (2021) Then when quarantine era ended at. I became more on unaware on new environment that caused me not being so used to deal with people even though im much older than them. My mom took me to private therapy. That was the time they assumed that I HAD autism. My private therapy is a a low-key bogus over a years until now. She had me risked my eyesight, 20 hours of sleep per that led to absenteeism and ruined my studies by her same advises on forcing me to drink the pills she provided (Benadryl and other 2s), ever since in 2023-2024 everything was supposed to be fine when I go to new school, did I forgot to mentioned that I switched to face to face class to online class in my year 2022-2023 because of bullying? So yeah, it was supposed to be fine when I never drank that pills again otherwise it ruined my present days of school. I can't state much further since I literally forgot everything because of that pills. Now I realized the fact that my parents still overcontrolled me ever since a baby until my current age (17) that caused my life turned into degenerate. My cousins who are much younger than me are became even my big brothers and sisters.. Because my parents misinformed them that I *have* autism which finds me annoying and I really needed to improve and develop my brain and body by going to gym and joining intellectual clubs. But my parents refused, because it finds them too risky for me but they're really just assumed that I am autism, which they find frustrating. Their misunderstanding is painful; even my younger cousins view me as “different.” 

I can manage my life. I’ve had a part-time job that they forced me to quit, and I even attended church services, which they disapproved of. Recently, I purchased a gym membership with my own money, something that was a source of pride for me. Yet, now they prevent me from going, stifling my freedom and growth during these crucial adolescent years. Their determination to control my life leaves me feeling trapped, while my siblings agree that raising me like this has been misguided. I feel like I’m wasting precious time and money on opportunities that could help me grow stronger and more independent. In the eyes of my relatives, I’ve become a stagnant presence, and I can’t help but blame my parents for the way they’ve stunted my development and confined me to a life that feels increasingly unfulfilling.

PS: my private therapy never claimed that I have autism. But mentally unstable all the time, my mom was really informed that, but did the wrong turn. ",1,0,1746630698.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kgzrzv/they_always_see_me_as_a_special_child/
1kgvfpp,Should I report them?,Abbienolanxxx,"
Bit of context, I left my ex when my daughter was 6 weeks old due to finding out he has got another woman pregnant. He hounded me for a year to get back together but I couldn’t do it knowing he had another child out there. Cut a long story short, he’s been with this other woman for 8 years now, also having another child by her. Thing is she claims single parent, has done since being with him. He lives with her and has even been doing renovations in the house. Thing is, his girlfriend claims csa from him which obviously then halves my csa from him. She claims it then gives it him back, when asking him about this he said ‘she won’t stop claiming it from me because she doesn’t think you deserve the full amount for our daughter’. I don’t understand how benefits haven’t clocked on to the fact they have had another child during this time aswell. He’s recently decided he isn’t seeing my daughter anymore due to me putting boundaries in place for her safety. So I’m hella annoyed, and I don’t want to seem spiteful but for years Iv told him she needs to stop claiming for it, it’s not fair. Like I said she claims single person benefits so I know she’s on good money, and she also then has his income From work coming in, and she’s also doing something on the side from home which I know she isn’t declaring, baring in mind this woman hasn’t ever worked a day in her life. It’s really starting to anger me now, I feel bad because ultimately it will affect their children and they will get in trouble, but then again I get my csa halfed because of her and he doesn’t help contribute anything else to his child, he doesn’t even take her out when he was seeing her, he’d take her to his and gfs house and dump her there to play on her phone. What do you think I should do? I’m honestly not a bitter or spiteful woman and I have kept my mouth shut for 8+ years now, but the blantant disregard for my child is really annoying me. I work an incredibly hard job working long hours to make sure my daughter gets everything she needs and it feels like I’m slaving away while they are frauding their way through life!",4,3,1746618837.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kgvfpp/should_i_report_them/
1kgq4gv,ACCIDENTALLY found out details of a PAST Affair when visiting my grandmother - now my family is calling me a homewrecker,XOXOdragonfly,"CAST LIST: 

**Grandmother Mabel** \- my ""step"" grandmother (mom’s stepmom)

*Great Aunt Pearl* \- My maternal grandfather’s sister (sister-in-law to Grandmother Mabel)

**Lily** \- my childhood friend I met up with while in town

**Lily’s Dad** \- Lily’s father who had an affair with his co-worker (Pearl)

*Pearl* \- aka my Great Aunt Pearl who had an affair with Lily’s Dad

**Aunt Maggie** \- my mother’s sister

I (30F) flew 1,380 miles one weekend to visit my Grandmother Mabel (my mom’s stepmom) for her 80th birthday. I've known her my whole life and have a loving relationship with her. My family who still live in that city - my grandfather's sister - *Great Aunt Pearl* and my Aunt Maggie - have NOT recognized her as part of the ""family"" since my grandfather passed in 2013. So my Grandmother does not have a close relationship with her sister-in-law nor her step-daughters (my mother and aunt). My Grandmother Mebel has her brother’s side of the family nearby so she has her own family support system.

I haven’t visited in 6 years and was only staying for the weekend. I didn't want my time being pulled to visit other family - as I wanted to visit her - and I have a better relationship with my Grandmother as we talk at least once a week. My *Great Aunt Pearl* lives across town, but we’re not close. To avoid drama, I told those involved that I wouldn’t be posting about the trip nor trying to meet up with other family because my Grandmother's 80th birthday was my priority.

Knowing I'd be in town I did reach out to a childhood friend, *Lily,* I’ve stayed in touch with after all these years. We hadn’t seen each other since middle school as we both went to different high schools and my family moved out of state. I told her not to tell anyone I was in town, and we met up for brunch on my LAST DAY and she dropped me off at the airport. We caught up on life like how she moved back in with her parents recently after a breakup, ect. She understood not to tell anyone I was in town.

About a week later, I got a furious text from *Great Aunt Pearl*, saying she was humiliated that she heard about my visit from a **coworker** and shamed me for not stopping by. Confused, I reached out to Lily and asked if she worked with my *Great Aunt Pearl*. That’s when the entire situation exploded.

That’s how I found out my *Great Aunt Pearl* had been caught having an affair with Lily’s dad when we were in high school! Her dad played guitar at their church, and *Pearl* was in the choir. That’s “supposedly” how they met and used late nights or fake practices for their affair. When he was caught having an affair, Lily's parents agreed to stay together - do marriage counseling - and switched churches. Lily's dad promised to cut off all contact with his affair partner *Pearl* (my Great Aunt). But the double secret was that they were actually co-workers who just so happened to be active in their churches! So even after all these years he was still in communication with his affair partner as she was his **coworker** and he NEVER told his wife. 

Here’s the timeline: 

* I fly in for the weekend for my Grandmother’s 80th birthday
* Visit Lily who takes me to the airport on my last day
* Lily tells her parents we caught up
* Lily’s dad tells his co-worker Pearl ""my daughter hung out with your great neice"" 
* My Great Aunt Pearl texts me furious
* I ask Lily if she works with my Great Aunt Pearl
* Lily and I realize that her dad is coworkers with my Great Aunt Pearl
* Lily tells her mother - and everything blows up

Now my *Great Aunt* *Pearl* is posting about me on social media, calling me toxic and a liar, saying I “destroyed a family” with my lies. Some extended relatives have unfriended me online and are taking her side. I had *no idea* about the past affair, not did I ever share about it online. I just asked my friend Lily if my upset *Great Aunt Pearl* was her co-worker!

But I had *no idea* that any of this would happen while visiting my Grandmother for her special 80th birthday. All I was trying to do was figure out who told my Great Aunt I had been in town. I would have never imagined that anything like this would happen! I feel devastated for my friend, but now I’m being blamed for “ruining their family”, “by stirring up the past”, and accidentally revealing that my religious aunt had an affair with a married man! My Aunt Maggie says I should have kept my mouth shut but I wasn't the one who cheated, I didn’t spread gossip…I just got caught in the crossfire of someone else's secrets! My friend Lily made the decision to tell her mother!! Not that I was trying to cause any problems…I didn’t even know her father knew my Great Aunt. 

I feel terrible for Lily, who now thinks her parents may actually divorce over this. We’re still close, and I’m trying to support her the best I can. But I’m also dealing with fallout in my own family. My *Great Aunt Pearl* had disowned me publicly (on social media). She is spreading her own narrative about me calling me a 'homewrecker"" and I have several other family members - like my Aunt Maggie - siding with her. As far as I know the affair was in the past, and it stopped when they were caught. However they stayed secret co-workers and he has stayed loyal to his wife ever since. I’m not accusing anyone of cheating, I just found out that they were coworkers. They’re own past decisions to keep the co-worker relations a secret (after the affair) is what caught up to them but I’m being punished for exposing them? ",1,0,1746597269.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kgq4gv/accidentally_found_out_details_of_a_past_affair/

1kgn7pn,My half-sister needs a home,Aromatic-Mushroom804,"Okay so my half sister on my dad’s side is needing a home to stay in. 
Our dad is in prison. 
Her mom passed away last year. 
She was living with her older sister but she had a baby and kicked her out. 
She moved in with my dad old roommate and her niece had an accident with fentanyl so she had to leave there too. 
Now she’s living back with her grandma and her grandma is saying she’s too old to raise her she needs to find another place to live. 

My question really is, if she moves in with me and my husband would we be able to get any financial assistance? 
We don’t make much, we’re both servers. We do own our own home and are married with an extra room that’s used for my clothes lol. 
I don’t want her having to worry about finding a place to stay when we have a place for her but I also want to be able to afford to give her a teenage girl life and also be able to afford our mortgage and other bills. 
She would have to move school districts and would have to stay home alone all day when we’re at work 5 days a week.

1kgmoda,Family Member Wanting to Move in with Me,Slight-Active-6934,"I have a family member that is insisting to move in with me. They claim that with their limited income they don't have enough to rent anywhere in our city and refuses to live in the 'ghetto' areas. We sgare a car with this person, it is a shared commodity that neither of us own, my uncle does, and we've both put money into it. 

The problem with this person is that they are very much a 'my way is better' or 'your doing it wrong, let me go behind/teach/ or scoff at me when I do things in my home. They call me lazy, and while I do things at my own pace, seem to not realize how much my ADHD affects how I live. They think I'm a hoarder, trifling to live with because I don't automatically clean up every little mess like they want me to, tell me they EXPECT things done when they leave the apartment like I'm a child. Today I told them we aren't moving in together, that them staying here was for them to get back on their feet and save money, and now they're claiming we 'used them' and took 'advantage' of them when they've been staying here rent free, bill free, got me on the hook for repairs on the car, and wiped me out of my savings to fix said car.

They're also almost impossible to even be around. I can't be myself around them. I can't use certain words or it'll trigger them. They go around and use certain words in a playful manber but the moment I try, I'm insulting them. You can't argue with them because then your attacking them. I can't be myself around them.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I can't play peace keeper anymore and I don't know how to explain to this person why they make it so difficult to live with. How they make me feel when they say I'm lazy after coming home from work because I won't cook or clean the moment I get home at night. Not to mention the fact I'm actively looking for another job and now I can't even rely on them to at least DRIVE me when the car is shared.",1,0,1746585180.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kgmoda/family_member_wanting_to_move_in_with_me/
1kglewo,Sibling with Mental Health - Constant Calling,oh_thatscrappy77,"Nothing new for me, but my brother has mental health/dependency issues and he doesn't have any friends and basically calls everyone else in the family, including myself. He doesn't really pick-up on social queues and any sort of conversation with him is usually him complaining about other people or something about his day. It's something we all have had to dealt with and I have tried to create boundaries and just not pick-up his calls much, but only from time to time. Talking to him is like a damn argument and it's never a hello or a how are you, but more like, ""you're an inconsiderate...."" or, ""you are so spoiled..."" or, ""you dgaf about me..."" or, ""you think you know everything..."" and the list goes on. I've seen strangers and aquaintences who get mad or fed up speaking with him. I've tried over the years to block and ignore the contacts entirely, but it seems to trigger him even more. Right now, he mostly talks to my family that's closer in town, while I do not live anywhere nearby. I feel bad I don't enjoy the conversations, but they're all just venting or criticisms about me, other people, and makes me have no desire to speak to him. Have not found a solution, other than to pick-up once in awhile, then he chills for awhile for a few days, but then it starts up with the constant calls again. Ugh!

1kg8ucc,Emotional attachment,Slow-Challenge-1828,"So, there is a lot going on in my head, 

  
Basically I am asking if what I am going to do is wrong.

  
So let me start...

  
My Mum died when I was just over a year old (I am nearly 25), my dad married more a less 2 years later and i grew up with her as 'My Mum' and still to this day i think of her as my mum, sounds sad but i dont really have a connection towards my birth mum, but i love her very much and wish i had met her.

  
my step mum and dad got married and my dad has me and my step mum has a son, so basically forced a family really, then a few years later they had a child together.

  
now i am 25 i am struggling having a relationship with them (not necessarily my dad)i know she loves me, but we always argued, over stupid little things, and ive learnt that im not a bad/horribl perosn or i wasnt naughty when i was younger, and there was never physcial abuse, more mental abuse, i would just moved away to another family member made out im a horrible naughty child.for instance car rides, i would be in the back and my little sister would be in the front, these litttle things add up when you get older, and naturally last year i stepped back and i felt like it was good, but i feel bad stepping back, or i feel guilty.

  
that is nothing, i could go on but i wallow, basically I am the black sheep, 'you look awful', 'your trainers are disgusting' 'you look nice for once' ' arent you embarrassed' this is my mum doing this stuff and all my life it has been like this and i just find it so down grading and cant cope anymore.

  
also naturally i think my connection has changed as on my nhs notes it states 'first day i met her she was different' and all sorts. she does love me but idk...

  
she thinks something is wrong and there isnt really but she doesnt invite me to family events etc., my dad i love him so much, we are close..

  
from my little sister seeing that authourty my mum gave her as a child towards me she now uses that against me now we are older,



i need to step back, maybe not physically more mentally, stop being vulnerable and asking for acceptance etc., 

  
these have also emotional attactment issues since being with my partner ( i love him so so much) which is why i am finding these answers, because he just loves me for me and i have found true genuine love.

  
theres no real genuine love really, very seperated family ",1,0,1746548868.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kg8ucc/emotional_attachment/
1kg43dd,"Exposure to parent’s sex life, and how it backfires",wtevr134,"Throwaway account. So, my parents have never really been discreet about their sexual life. As I was young (10 to 14) it was smacking on my mom’s ass, inappropriate talk mostly from my stepdad’s side, jokes of the same sort etc, all in front of me. I did not really understand the problem with it since I was a kid, but as I became older it made me uncomfortable. I tried to ask my parents to tone it down, but my concerns were mostly dismissed. On top of everything, every once in a while, a year or so, (I was already around 13 when it began) my stepdad brought up a conversation about how I should be careful with meeting people, basically not to sleep around, because it’s different for girls, than for boys.
So, the first time it really crossed the line was when I was about 14. My stepdad had that thing of telling my mom “not to provoke him” when she passed by him, and then proceeded to smack her ass. It was weird, but tolerable at the moment. Onto the case, he was leaving for work, I was in the kitchen by refrigerator, reaching for something. He went by, looked at me and said “[name], don’t provoke me”, and laughed. He did not touch me, did not do anything else, just left, and as soon as the door closed I became histerical. I called my mom in tears, told her what happened. She tried to calm me down, said she’d talk to him, and assured me he did not mean that this way. To him, quote “it was not the same. He never thought of this comment in this way towards me, because if he did, you know I’d never stay with him”.
I believe it was true, that if she ever thought he posed a threat to my wellbeing she would have left him. In every crucial turn she always chose me over him, and I do not question her motherly love or responsibility. She did speak to S (stepdad), though I refused to be present. Me and him basically didn’t talk for a few weeks, however the situation with comment never occurred again. For the context, S grew up very poor, his own stepfather has been beating him, his mother and little brother, for whom he took the hits. There were other issues, such as his stepfather’s alcoholism, etc. So, I understand why the idea of boundaries and what is considered “normal” in the family for S were very distorted. Other than that one comment, he has never said or done anything, and I mean, anything inappropriate. Still, well, sex-jokes have always been his default kind of humour with literally anybody: his friends, colleagues, even my mother’s side of the family (YES SOMETIMES EVEN HER PARENTS/MY GRANDPARENTS). To his credit, when my mom explained to him that it was inappropriate, he did tone it down, mostly at least, pot humour is still his second go-to setting.
Regardless the fact that I understand all of it now, the damage at the moment has been done, and I believe it served as a trigger point. The thing is, I have a long standing issues with intrusive thoughts and repetitive actions: checking the locks for 7-10 times in a row, repositioning things solely based on feeling, touching my books only after washing hands with soap, thinking I might die before I go to sleep if I don’t leave a Full glass of water on a nightstand to save me in case, etc, but there things took a turn for the worst. Once a picture was in my head, I couldn’t get it out. The thought of a parental figure in sexual context was stuck in front of my eyes and no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get it out. It made me question many things: “Did I like to see it? Did I want to see it? Is there something wrong with me? Is it something I want?” Looking at it in retrospect, of course I didn’t. It made me feel sick and disgusted to the point of histerical crying and wanting to peel my skin off, it made me feel horrible, as if there was something wrong with me. The thing is, I knew I did not want to think of them in this way. It was not a hidden desire, it was not something that I wanted (for f’s sake, I was 14), but I was trying to make sure I was 100% right about it, so the thoughts kept reappearing in front of my eyes, so I kept questioning myself over and over again. I felt nauseous every single time, yet I thought, maybe that’s what I actually wanted, and if I acknowledged it I could deal with it. But then when I really thought of it, I did not want anything to actually happen, so I knew what I knew from the beginning - it wasn’t what I wanted. So, jokes on me, because the more I went in circles the stronger neurological connections in my brain became, the more it appeared in front of me. Meanwhile, the war started (S became a soldier, we’re Ukrainians) and in the first couple of days (I won’t describe amount of stress we all were under) my mom became a part of those intrusive thoughts too. I have no idea why. But I spiralled again, this time even worse. So it was all circled. Sometime a year after I already knew that those were the intrusive thoughts, not what I “secretly” wanted, but the problem was far from getting solved, because at that time S started to come home every couple of months. I was very happy that he was alive and well, he practically raised me after all, and regardless of our many differences (not only this one but others unrelated to topic dialogues) we were close. It happened once he got home once and at night my parents did not close the door. When I went to shower, in the ten seconds it took to cross a corridor I. Have heard. Enough. Not only the image clear and LOUD in front of me, but there was an audio now, no avoiding it. So, I spiralled AGAIN, to the point where every time S came home most of the nights I slept over at my friend’s house. It did not become better when I told them to close the damn door, because S suggested to do it in the morning, to which my mom replied that she hates morning sex. what in the actual f mum, I’m still here.
Looking back it sounds silly, but at the moment it made me feel like shit. The environment of the people you used to know dying only made it far more surreal, everything was so confusing, and most of the time you were stuck with the same people for months. I never thought of ending everything, sui, but sometimes all those things made me want for all of it to stop. Stop being so disgusted with myself, stop thinking about things that brought me nothing but tears and desire to puke. Things, that I have never wanted to think about in the first place before they were put right freaking in front of me and my brain just fixated on it, and every time I almost managed to make it let it go, something would happen again. I was 14 to 17 years old. It wasn’t supposed to happen to me, and I’ve never heard of anything similar happening to someone else, so I had no idea how to deal with it.
I lashed out on the parents once, so they finally shut it down practically entirely, but it didn’t exactly bring me closure or anything. My mother suggested therapist, and this is the first time I put that in writing in four or five years, so maybe I’ll give it a try. I have my reservations because my last attempt with a shrink got so bad it made a dinner story of how NOT to go to a shrink, but I can put it aside.
I’m 18 now and moved to uni quite some time ago. I no longer question those thoughts. There are months I can go on without a single one, but sometimes there are weeks when they just reappear randomly, or on the contrary at the moments I would love never to have them. What I hate the most, perhaps, is when a certain thought gets stuck with an association to a mundane thing, and thus keeps reappearing. All of that really messed with my head and my perception of sex, so I’ll appreciate any advice on the topic.

Of course we told all 4 of our parents and they were all completely fine with the situation, they understand the reasoning with the navy, and can see that we are completely enamoured with each other. We were witnessed by our best friends, one of each. 
Another important note, is that my brother has been in a toxic relationship with a woman my entire family despises for over 2 years now. It’s been very hard to watch, especially with how she treats him, but I’ve tried to support him by just being his brother, and when I try to talk to him about it he shuts me out and refuses to tell me how he feels. I’ve kept my mouth shut about what I think of his partner and his relationship, as that’s not my place to say anything about. All I can do is be the person that’s happy to see him and support him. 
If anyone wants further details I’ll make an updated post with specifics. Anyway, to the crux of the issue. 

I (25M) just got married on Sunday (it’s Tuesday at the time of posting, after a short but very sweet honeymoon with my now wife (29F). I have been working with my brother (30M) in another state, about a 5 hour flight from home. I worked with him for 3 weeks of every month, and would take time to see my partner. During that time, he had a LOT to say about my relationship, including some extremely disrespectful things about my partner, most of which came during a rather interesting conversation about the things she wears. I won’t get into details, but it infuriated me and hurt my partner’s feelings a lot.
This obviously sucked, and when I got home, I searched for a job, found one, and then informed my brother I would not be coming back up to work with him. He took this fine, and he has no clue that I still feel upset with him (due to other reasons, including work and money troubles whilst I was there). In any case, as aforementioned, he has been really struggling with work and particularly money lately, and has organised some work with a big company that he was getting ready for just before my wedding. Now to get to the part that makes me want to change my last name:

I have always had a particular dynamic with my father. He has never been absent, but he has a problem with showing up. He fell asleep in the waiting room when I was born, forgot about important events and was always late/ didn’t turn up at all. Eventually my mum got sick of it and divorced him when I was in kindergarten when he didn’t show up for my Xmas party- he fell asleep on the couch because he was ‘tired from work’ (my mother also worked full time, and has continued to as a single mother to this day). In any case, this theme continued for the rest of my childhood- football games, parties, you name it- he would always say he would be there, and when the time came- no dad. I genuinely didn’t mind after a while. I understood he was busy and had a life, and he was a great dad whenever I was actually spending time with him. I never needed him to show up to my things because I’m quite independent as a person, and didn’t think most of the stuff was important enough for him to be there anyway. Usually the only thing that would piss me off about it was that he would say he’d be there, then not come. 
I have thought that he’s been turning a new leaf lately, as he has seemed a lot more involved in my life. He’s been supportive of the marriage, seemed very excited about it and to celebrate with me. This made me quite happy, and he even suggested I host a party for family, seems how the ceremony is small and they couldn’t come. I thought this was a great idea and so I organised it all, inviting my partners side of the family to come and getting everyone on board. My mother also invited her side of the family, who my partner and I love and get along with very well. 
Well, I call my father 3 days after the initial conversation about the party to confirm it’s organised (he knew the exact day and date already) and he goes “oh shit”. Apparently, his friends go mountain bike riding for a weekend in another state every year, and one of them bailed out and called my dad to see if he wanted the ticket, all expenses paid. Him, being in his own words ‘his selfish self’ accepted this wonderful offer, completely forgetting about his son’s impending wedding party (of which the actual wedding was the day after). He then says he has that, and can’t come. I was a bit taken aback, but I want him to come to my wedding party because he wants to, not because I told him he has to, so I told him he can do that if he wants. At the time, I thought it wouldn’t really bother me too much because it’s a running theme in my life anyway, and he still had the rest of the week to reconsider. Well, surprise surprise, he didn’t show up. It was only when my uncle, who is extremely unreliable, showed up to my party because he heard it was on and dropped everything last minute, that it hit me. My father had every opportunity to come to the party, and chose not to. My uncle, who is a chronic alcoholic and hated by half of the family, was there to support me and show me love, despite being busy that day. 
To really top things off, my mother invited to fly my brother down for the weekend for free to be there for the party and to spend time with family (he’s been having issues with his partner). He also declined, saying he was “too busy with getting ready for the big job.” This, coupled with the disrespect he’s shown me lately really got to me, I can’t lie. Both my brother and my father share my last name. My mother has always been there for me, and always shown up, even when she didn’t have to. She’s the most amazing person in my life bar my wife, who understands me better than any human ever has. I’m already fairly certain I want to change my last name to my mother’s, and my wife agrees that she wants that name more anyway. The real problem, is how the fuck do I broach this subject with my brother and particularly my father, without causing a massive rift? 
Don’t get me wrong, I don’t give a shit if they’re upset about it- they’re going to be upset anyway. I’ve had it with being the bigger person, keeping the peace and pretending nothing is wrong. I haven’t spoken up about being mad at my brother because he’s going through a lot right now and I didn’t want to add to it, but I can’t ignore that he’s really done me wrong. What I do really care about, is not permanently harming my relationship with them. I want to find a way to broach it that’s not spiteful. I was thinking of mentioning that because I believe my wife is my equal, I find it fair for both of us to change our last names. Seems how her parents are still together there’s only one last name we could both change to- my mother’s, which she loves and she’s fully on board with it. Please, if I could get some advice on how to go about talking to my father (and to a lesser degree my brother) about changing my last name from theirs. Sorry for the long post, and again I can update with any further information/ context if I missed anything.

1kfzp6b,I just found out from a family member that my mom and her BF Alex from Chicago got into a fight and he choked her until she passed out.,LukaeaS,"Hello. I’m at a loss. My mom is in Washington. And her ex military BF Alejandro Martinez and his two sons moved in with her. I found out that she told my brother who told my dad who told me that he choked her until she blackout. I call my mom immediately upset. I asked her what happened. She didn’t want to tell me. 

Which I took as a bad sign because when her previous ex hit her it was a reaction because he was abused by his ex wife. But it came up in a argument and he spoke with me in the car about and explain that it was just a reaction and if it ever came to a point that he would actually hit my mom he would leave and as far as I know it didn’t happen again. 

So she didn’t want to talk about it and said if I continued on she would disappear and I would never see her again. That pissed me off even more because she always pulls that crap when she is upset and doesn’t want to hear what anyone else has to say. 

I don’t know what to do because she says she hit him first but I don’t know if she lying for him. I got more of the story from my dad. After he choked her she was supposed to buy him and his kids plane tickets but I guess that went out the window.

Now I’m an equal opportunity asskicker if a women can hit a guy then she should be able to take it. It’s still an abusive relationship though. But choking to me is a different thing. To choke someone until they are essentially about to die from lack of oxygen it too much.

I’m currently in a killing rage. I’ve imagined the different ways to do some terrible things to him if I ever come across him. 

I need advice on what to do. What I can do?

Update: I’ve put him on my list. Researched his life on facebook. Going to find out all I can. Then my going to tell the police and give him his job info so they can question him at work. I saved his picture. I’m going to post everything I know on FB so all his family and friends will know and I’ll do more.",2,0,1746521422.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kfzp6b/i_just_found_out_from_a_family_member_that_my_mom/
1kfy4kd,My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage,Responsible_Bake3941,"I (22 F) and my fiancé (24 M) just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that. Since the very beginning of our relationship, it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother (62 F). Now, it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding. Let me explain.

After my now fiancé and I began dating, I began to tell my mom about him, since I was obviously excited about this new relationship. Some of her biggest gripes were that he’s nothing more (in her mind) than a backwoods redneck, and essentially that I’m too good for him. But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long-time Jehovah’s Witnesses. Ever since I told her this, she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had. 

Example A: She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up. I told her no, it really wasn’t his thing, and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork/construction that he does now, and never took much of an interest in sports. She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn’t done any sports, since he couldn’t do anything that would put him around being people that weren’t JW (I know this is true within the religion, but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young). I’ve tried to explain this as not true, but she simply won’t accept it.

Example B: I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in. After dating for almost a year, I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living. Ever since I’ve moved, and especially after I told her about our engagement, all she does is say that I’ve been “sucked in”. She’s convinced I’m in a cult. She’s also said she hates my ex boyfriend (who cheated on me) to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him.

Example C: Since starting working post-college, I’ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into (fundraising), and I haven’t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before. I’ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life, like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home, since I have learned that cleaning, cooking, and decorating, are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall. She says I’m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I’m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years. She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from, even after I had said many times I didn’t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new, and find a nice boy down there to settle down with.

Example D: Since announcing our engagement, she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare. When I told her our initial wedding date, she asked why we were rushing it. I told her we just didn’t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married. She grilled me and said I must be pregnant, and what happened to having a long engagement? 

She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family, even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family. From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating, she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer (we live 4.5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends) and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up, she told me it was already too late (this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating)

She’s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family. When we weren’t speaking a couple months back, she didn’t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because “I didn’t ask how the dog was”. I never got a chance to say goodbye. Before this she had previously called me at 12:30 am after we hadn’t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent $10,000 at the casino. Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should’ve never asked.

All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family. This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself/our relationship as he calls it. 

When I told my mother the date, she said it was too soon and that she didn’t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn’t help me with the wedding. I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would, and she said yes. I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors. While this was true, after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well. My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where, for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding, and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship. 

Ever since, we’ve been arguing pretty consistently. The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement. He’s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing, and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I’m in. But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I’m going to be loyal to him, not to my mom. The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some, and he’s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to, since it is a small town here. My in laws are absolutely incredible, and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom. We often go out to lunch together, and just spend a lot of time together overall. Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard. I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing. My mom is my only family, since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn’t close with any of her siblings, and all my grandparents are gone. I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else. How do I prove myself to my fiancé? How do I stick up to my mother, and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her? Can I salvage a relationship with both of them? My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me, like being the parent that stayed when my dad left. But I also love my fiancé more than anything, and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us. He’s said he’s just been in a down mood in general, he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement, because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness. I’ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it’s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings.

1kfw9fq,I don’t know what to do anymore.,Sev-_,"Today my family had a altercation with each other. It started with my brothers calling each other names and making snark remarks to each other. It escalated into a bad fight with them punching each other and calling each other names worse than usual. I’m the oldest. The second oldest (J) is obviously a better fighter than the third(A). J is 12 and A is 11. J even made a remark of not stopping the fight until he saw A’s nose bleed and they were fighting very harshly which isn’t too rare or too common but it never got as heated as it did this time. J said either A respects him or he won’t stop beating him and A said he would never respect him no matter what. They have always been at each other’s throats for as long as I could remember. My mom is an unfit mother. She doesn’t know how to handle them or deal with the situation. She rather just go the easy route and try to avoid confrontation because she is a narcissist that believes she is a better mother than most and that since she provides the bare minimum she’s a great mother. She came out of her room on her stupid sleeping pill like usual and instead of breaking up the fight she swings at J and confiscates the game. This is what we are used to. Her using her fists before trying to deescalated the situation. J immediately tries to defend himself and she thinks that taking away the game would solve the problem when THEY WERENT EVEN FIGHTING FOR THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. ITS PARTIALLY HER FAULT OUR FAMILY CANT GET ALONG OR AT LEAST BE TOLERANT TO ONE ANOTHER. She says she doesn’t know why J acts the way he does when she knows damn well he acts like the spitting image of her angry narcissistic self. They’re both too proud. Obviously J goes to his room upset and crying and A goes to the couch and cries. I give A space to relax and just go to sleep. J is a different story. I had a feeling I needed to get him to talk his feelings. I enter his room and he doesn’t say anything. I kept going and slowly sat on his bed next to him and tried to give him a hug to maybe comfort him since he looked like he needed it. He pulls away and starts crying and telling me to leave him the fuck alone. That we were no longer his family and all of us can go to hell. I had no part in the fight. I stayed away and didn’t jump in for anyone. I wanted to let them have a fair fight and get their feelings out so I can understand why they’re so mad at each other and can’t get along. J just keeps yelling and pulling away from me telling me to just leave him alone. I obviously don’t want to leave him alone because I want him to talk to me and tell me what’s going on and why he feels so angry. I kept trying and after 15 whole minutes of slowly started to cry and getting told off by him I left. I know my family isn’t perfect. I know I am not perfect. I know my mother isn’t a good mother but I don’t want my family to break apart… I wish I could maybe get a family therapist and see what the problems are but my mom clearly wouldn’t want to pay for that or even accept the idea of her being a bad parent and failing at her own parenting. I have never genuinely hugged her for years. I have never heard an I love you from her after I was 10 and ever since we moved from an apartment to a house she’s gotten a job and is spending everyday at work. My brothers are starting to blame each other for her not being home and think maybe she just doesn’t want to deal with us. She spends more time with her work friends than with us and my stepdad is too busy working his ass off in another state since he works on stuff like windmills around the states which is obviously meaning that he isn’t home as often but he tries to be and tries to take my siblings to do things kids should do like go out for once and go play in a park. My mom doesn’t bother. She never plans anything for her own children. The person who plans everything is my stepdad. He takes us and buys us things and my mom can barely even make time to take my youngest brother (Jn) to his speech therapy. I seriously don’t know what to do. My siblings started thinking of me as their actual mom at this point since I’m the one taking care of them while my mother hangs out at work like she doesn’t have, not one child, but 4 children she is responsible for at home. If she isn’t capable of taking care of us why bother having 4 children? I’m barely 16… I’m doing my best to try and keep things together. I hate being this helpless and weak. I wish I could do more. I wish I wasn’t scared to tell her what her problem is and how she is failing as a mother. It’s not that her job is the entire problem. I don’t mind that she has a job at all. The problem is she works EVERYDAY!!! Even on her days off! WHAT PERSON WANTS TO WORK ON A DAY OFF?! She works every single fucking day of the week and even after work she still goes on the phone and calls her fucking work buddies instead of idk making us a actual meal instead of bringing left over fucking pizza that you had actually bought for work instead of us, her children. It’s not even my brothers fault they can’t get along. It’s all in the parent. I know this is wrong of me but I missed when my mom actually spent time with us and the last time she spent time with us was before she got weight loss surgery and got a job. I miss my mom when she was jobless, fat, and actually not making everything about her. I miss my mom who would at least cook for us daily and try to spend time with us. I miss when we were actually important to her. That’s when my brothers weren’t fighting so badly and when everyone could stop having such hard feelings towards each other. I wish I could get my brothers into better schools. I hate how ghetto public schools are. What happened to being a kid? I just want my family to be close again. To stop the constant fighting and to just try to talk to each other like normal families. I don’t want to feel helpless when asking for my family members to try and fix each other. I’m trying my hardest here. I’m crying in my room alone. Unsure of how to fix this broken home. I don’t want my last of my teenage years crying over a broken family. We don’t have anyone. I wish it was easier to accept a hug and some love. I feel awkward when my mom tries to hug me. I feel like I’m in a house with complete strangers. I know who my brothers are but I can’t connect with them. I know who my mother is but she won’t connect with any of us and it makes it hard to connect to her. Only thing helping me through is the goods times we rarely have. At school it’s an escape from how lonely my usually loud house is. I hide through humor in front of my friends so I don’t feel weak and helpless in front of them. I seriously don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to lose my family. I hate being alone.",1,0,1746506742.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kfw9fq/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/

1kfuvq1,Since nobody will listen,Firm_Contribution868,"Right from birth maybe 3 months old Brenda put me in a garbage bag and threw me in the garbage. I stopped breathing and they some how actually managed to save

my life getting air back into me. Since then she started doing all sorts of things that would put me in danger. She undressed me, walked out into the alley and sat me down,

then turned around went back inside to have an affair with a very,very young person and then falling asleep. Hoping that someone would come by and pick me up, abducting me,

or running me over. She would find complete strangers and let them 'borrow' me for the day. Then she would accuse them of molesting me, touching me, whatever it was and then

collect money from them. Or just get them sent to prison. My recollection of this is quite fuzzy but I do know of a time she passed me over to a young man and woman inside the

Dairy Queen in the mall in Brooks, Alberta saying 'youre just gonna go with them for a bit'. They were walking around the mall with me telling people that I was their child.

Then I ended up in some dark, dirty basement with the man undressing me. He took off my shirt then got on his knees and took my pants off and then staring at my genitals.

The woman that was there then told him to comeover to where I was she had to show him something. Then I dont know who it was, maybe Brenda came storming in saying 'you leave him alone'

and picked me up carrying me outside to the car. I asked 'what happened' 'he was going to do something that he shouldnt be doing'. Got in the car and thats all I recall.

I was wearing black shorts and shirt with purple lettering on it. Im starting to assume from that even that they were maybe collecting some sort of payment, for what I dont know. Since then Brenda

has gotten family and friends all to take a turn (usually holding a pillow over my face) cutting off my air supply when I'm sleeping. She will have 'no idea what hes even

talking about' of course, would you admit to doing something like that? Probably not unless you wanted to go to jail that bad. And it seems that everyone that has taken a turn 

doing it are no longer around, no facebook, no way to get a hold of them. The first time I can recall it happening was when I was sleeping over at my friends house.

When I fell asleep they held a pillow over me and completely stopped me from breathing. The mother had to come and breathe life back into me. When I woke up my friends

told me about what happened. The one friends then said 'before we left your mom told us to do it' I said 'she would never tell anyone to do it'  They then said

'she said if we do it she would buy us new skateboarding shoes' I continued to say 'No way my mom would never tell you to do that'  with a shocked look in their eyes

they said 'seriously but dont say we told you'  When I got home I asked my mom about it and with a smirk she said 'of course not'  Thats where my shares came from. Everything

she has used me for she has kept all the money or spent it on stuff like embarassing me or getting me beat up. Evan has done it a couple times. And he has also ran a hose

from the exhaust to the cab of the truck I was passed out in almost killing me. The next day and a few after Brenda would say shit like 'just go kill yourself' or 'you should

have just stayed in the truck'.  She has got my friend Nick to do the pillow thing, he told me. And now cant get a hold of the guy anywhere. When I was working in Dutchess she

payed 10,000 to some guy to come out there and do the same thing. The only thing that kept me alive this long is that she thought there was a Trust or some shit that was for me

just so there would be people watching over me and she wouldnt want me dead so soon.  There was this one woman I was sort of dating but her and Brenda started getting along really

good, they were going to Brooks together and stuff. One night we were drinking and her and Brenda gave me this pill or something for me to take. Next thing I knew is I woke up

in the hospital in Lethbridge. Right away Brenda said that 'you should make a personal trust'  she thought this because just incase I needed to transfer over assets really fast.

She had a lawyer come down and fill one out. When he left he took a copy for himself and another copy went to the nurse to keep with my file just incase we needed to reference it

later it would be a safe place to keep it. I called down to ask them about it but they wont let me know anything I have to be there in person. But Im guessing by now that Brenda

either had a friend that works there go in and take it out or Evan had his sister Aleita go in and take it. Most likely switching it up and putting Mason on there since he was also

at the hospital.  No matter what Brenda will try and leave me as broke as possible. Just giving money away. Stealing whatever money she can. She puts on a good show but she is evil

as evil could be.  Shes payed off so many people in town at this point that nobody will be on my side or beleive me.  Another thing that happened is when I lived with Dawn they contacted

my Nana and have been receiving money as well with my family thinking it is me. There was one night she called me upstairs in her old house and it was Brenda, her husband, my 2 brothers and his wife.

They showed me this bank statement that showed I had millions from shares and other accounts. One of them then said 'yep, thats why were doing this' and Brenda said

'were taking it from you' then everything went completely black. But now in that house the new 'owners' because they actually didnt sell it they are just hiding money.

They built a wall right where this happened. Stupid spot, weird, dont know why they would do that. But something tells me they filmed the entire thing of my reaction and now to cover it up

that it wasnt me in the video they got the people that did the renevations to build a wall right where this all happened. She has dont everything she can to either kill me or send me to prison.

She has even gone as far as paying women to say that I raped them. Dont even have to touch them, they just say I raped them and she has to go into a trust account and pay them off.

It always has to be a situation where it would scare me into thinking nobody would beleive me and I would go to jail. Shes an evil bitch. This old friend of mine Dawn and Kaylee are no different.

I know they contacted my family pretending to be me and collecting cheques from my family. Collecting birthday cheques or whatever. From what I gather what happened is someone in my family found out

and contacted them, they just offered them some of the money and payed them off. Easy as that. And instead of giving me the cheques personally, just went around to places I go to and said 'here give these

to Devan' like they actually fucking would. Im not getting any fucking answers from anyone because everyone has had a turn ripping me off and nobody wants to take responsibility. They have fucked with my head to

bad at this point that its all a game to them.  This could all be a fucking little game just to fuck with my head. Because what they need is for me to be crazy. Especially if its one

of the how many people have a fake, illegal power of attorney over me. So as long as they make me go crazy, it then gives them, in their sick fucking heads, the ability to access my funds or assets

and do whatever the hell they want with it.  These people abuse power of attorney to its fullest. And if they are my power of attorney wheres my rent being payed, wheres my utilities being payed,

where my allowance, wheres any of it?  Its my funds and thats one of the responsibilitys of power of attorney. Brenda was the first one that I know of to do up a power of attorney one night when I was

drunk. Which automatically makes it void, completely null. Any legal agreement or contact signed while one of the individuals is intoxicated or under the influence, by law it makes it completely void

right from the beginning. Making any money they justified spending illegal as fuck. But once that power of attorney was made I noticed she was really tryihng to drive me

crazy. Just doing shit to annoy the piss out of me. I also suspect she was feeding me mercury and getting people to put in my dope. There was a bunch of flourescent lightbulbs broken in the garage but

the entire house or garage does not take these bulbs anywhere. When asked about them I was told 'oh i think mason found those and was playing around with them' The white powder that is

found inside of those bulbs is mercury. Its in powder for but it is mercury. You can easily add that into someones food, drugs, drink, whatever.  Making them mentally unstable. unstable

enough that making a financial decision themselves would be considered no in their best intrest. Thats where power of attorney comes into play. Now whoever has that power of attorney can make financial

desicions for that person, as long as its in their best intrest. In this case, I think paying people to embarass me or to beat me up is not in my best intrest what so ever. I think me being homeless\]

and other people getting trailers bought for them or whatever other toys, jeeps, whatever. How can that work? Isnt power of attorney suppose to make sure all taht is taken care of for that person?

None of this has been in my best intrest or to benefit me. They want me to sell their own shit back to them. Or any shit back to them. So it dosent feel like they themselves are losing. ",3,2,1746501860.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kfuvq1/since_nobody_will_listen/
1kfmndu,How do I talk things out?,Unable-Victory6168,"For context I am a 24 yo woman and in a lesbian relationship. My parents got divorced when I was young and both have raised me in a very non-confrontational environment. I've always been scared of conflict and of punishment or anything of the sort. Sorry, this may be a long post but I just don't know what to do. 

I live in a major city in my state and almost five hours away from my hometown. I moved here for school and in my undergrad (with Covid and different class schedules) I came home a lot more often. I also didn't really have friends here, so I was usually in communication with my parents. When I started work and grad school, my visits home and communication dwindled. I also got into my first relationship ever and it has been an incredible healthy one--she's not afraid to talk about her emotions and face issues head on rather than let time and emotions fester. My mom met her first (she was visiting my city) and it was a great first meeting. 

I have not been home very often during the time of our relationship, and there are two incidents where we planned to go to my hometown and we decided to leave a day early. The first was Christmas and we were going to see other family, and the second was just decided because we were honestly bored at home in my small town and wanted to see my partner's grandmother who was in the hospital. My mom clearly took offense to this and I could tell from how she texted and called me a few weeks after that. Both my partner and I tried to squash any uneasy feelings and try to move forward, but my mom clearly got the wrong impression of our relationship. 

  
This past Thanksgiving I went home, and my mom basically confronted me and asked me about my relationship, saying she's worried I don't have a voice of my own. This really upset me, and I tried to explain how much I have grown as a person and how \*good\* of a person my partner is, just as a person and as my partner. I asked my dad about his thoughts on my relationship, and he was very vague (which is typical). I asked my younger brother, and he told me that my parents--who hardly talk as is--talk about my relationship and not in a positive way. This deeply upset me and I should have sat them both down then and talked about it. 

  
When my partner and I were planning for the Christmas holiday then, I sent both my parents a detailed text of our plan, so there would be no room to misunderstand any plans on leaving early, as we had other relatives to see. I also expressed some of my feelings how I felt they were treating me and my relationship like I am a teenager rather than a young adult woman. They seemed to take it okay. When we got there, it was amicable at my dad's house. When we went to my mom's, my partner and I were trying so hard to engage with her in conversation, but she seemed almost in a daze. She was clearly upset. 

  
Now, this has been my last semester in grad school and things have been more distanced with my parents. We already don't have a huge phone-call, every-day-texting relationship, but spaced out across the weeks giving life updates. Things seemed to start going okay. They were proud of me for completing my master's degree. Skip forward to today, and I find out that I missed a deadline by three days to walk the stage. I am still graduating but I don't have a spot reserved in my commencement ceremony. I'm not that upset about this but mortified thinking about how I'm gonna tell my parents and how they're going to react. I ended up calling my dad first since he asked a question relevant to graduation, and I explained the situation and some alternative ideas to celebrate. He seemed disappointed but not like he really cared, and texted me a few minutes later about an unrelated thing. But then my mom texted me saying my dad had already called her so ""no need to call me."" Upset that my dad took away my chance to talk about it to her myself, I sent a long text explaining the situation and, again, alternative celebration ideas. I asked to call her and she was clearly upset, choked up. She basically was like ""I just don't know what to do with us"" and how ""every time I try to ask you about something, you always become so defensive"", so mainly her being upset about our communication. We both said we'd collect our thoughts and call sometime soon, but I am just so lost on how to approach it all. 

I feel that my parents view me as a love-blind child and not the adult who has blossomed by myself and with my partner. I feel like with their limited perception of her (and trust, we've tried different ways to get around and given suggestions) they think she's a bad influence on me, or somehow abusive, or keeping me away from them. I have tried before to explain myself and I'm worried I'm never going to be heard. But I know I have to try. Thank you if you've read all of this and thank you in advance to any advice.

1kflwsr,Advice needed!,Ok-Cucumber-3494,"I’m 27 years old and currently still living at home with my younger brother, who’s 25. Our older sister has already moved out and has her own place. Unfortunately, my brother and I don’t get along at all. We have very different personalities, beliefs, and morals. I work full time, he doesn’t work at all. I don’t drink alcohol; he does—and he often drinks and drives. He’s rude, hateful, and completely disrespectful toward both me and the house we live in. He doesn’t clean up after himself, makes noise late at night, and even let his girlfriend move in without anyone’s proper consent.

Our mum doesn’t make either of us pay rent. I actually think she should, and I’d be more than willing to contribute financially—but I don’t think it’s fair for me to pay while he doesn’t.

Lately, living at home has become unbearable. My mental and physical health are suffering from being around him. He’s had previous run-ins with the police and has surrounded himself with the wrong people. Sometimes I honestly don’t feel safe in the house.

The final straw came after a huge argument one night. I went to work the next day and booked a hotel room just to get some peace and be alone. I started seriously considering moving out, even though my boyfriend and I already plan to get a place together next year. The idea of paying rent alone on a place I can’t really afford, just because I’m being pushed out of my own home by someone else’s behavior, feels incredibly unfair.

I spoke to my mum about all of this and told her that J needs to move out. We can’t keep living under the same roof. But deep down, I don’t believe she’ll actually tell him to leave. In the meantime, I’ve been bouncing between my sister’s and my boyfriend’s places, but I can’t keep doing that either. I need stability.

On top of all this, I’m starting to feel like I need to set some boundaries with my mum. Maybe even limit how much I involve her in my day-to-day life, as hard as that is to admit. I love her and I know she’d do anything for me—except this. And while I feel guilty for even thinking that way, I also feel like she’s making it easier for me to leave than to stand up to the person who’s causing the real issues.

I’m honestly struggling—emotionally, mentally, and practically. There’s more to the story than I can even put into words here, but any advice on how to move forward or what I need to hear right now would mean a lot.

1kfer17,The abuse didn’t die with her,Pristine-Campaign-89,"My mom spent years making my life hell.
She controlled everything — even makeup wasn’t allowed. She made sure my brothers had full power over me. Physical abuse, emotional abuse, complete control — and she never saw anything wrong with it. She made me feel like I was the problem.

Then she got cancer and went to France for treatment. That’s how she died — overseas. But my brain never fully processed it. I still dream about her coming back, like she was just on a trip. In the dreams, she’s back home like nothing happened. I wake up scared, confused, angry. And honestly, I don’t miss her. I don’t know how to.

People say “she’s your mom” or “you’ll regret not forgiving her.” But how do you forgive someone who let you be broken and never tried to fix it?

My brothers still treat me like they own me. Nothing changed after she died. My dad’s emotionally checked out — he only cares about himself. I’m stuck in this house, stuck with them, and I can’t get out because of stuff I can’t control.

I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive her. Or if I even want to.

1kfbfse,Feel constantly controlled by my mother and it's making me hate living at home,lawliet_loml,"I'm 17 and live with my mother, father, and two sisters. Lately, I've been feeling trapped and constantly controlled by my mother. She has a rule that if I go out one day I can’t go out the next even if it's the weekend or holidays and I have plans with family (I often visit my grandparents) She says I “go out too much” even if I stay home the day before.

She’s unpredictable. Sometimes she says yes to things sometimes no and her reasons feel random. E.g. I was planning to go out today, but suddenly she made me and my sisters tend to the garden. I didn’t even refuse as I helped my father instead with the front garden but she shouted at me (in the garden) for “not doing anything”  just because she didn’t see it. Then when I cleaned up the stuff she and my sisters left lying around (dirty gloves, water buckets,  inflatable pool just dumped on the floor) she got angry and said I ruined their “progress.”

What really bothered me was she made us all put our phones away before the work so I switched mine off before putting it down. Later she asked why I did that, and I’m 99% sure it’s because she tried to get into it. She’s done that before. One time she said she has the right to see my phones content. Every time I do something independent or rational she gets mad  like I’ve done something wrong.

The whiplash is also exhausting. One moment she lets me go out the next she lays into me about being lazy or sneaky. I feel like I’m being punished for existing and like nothing I do is ever enough. It’s making me hate being at home, and I genuinely can’t wait to move out. I even told my father when I was younger that I’d move out as soon as I could and my mother said   I ""have to live here forever and get married"" and that I’m turning into my uncle who lives alone peacefully btw.

Am I being dramatic? Is this normal? I don’t know how to deal with this anymore.

1kfatms,Why do I hate my dad (and mum) so much??,Ok_Employment_2852,"Okay so, context, growing up my dad was always working early morning to late evening so I didn’t really see him that much - I feel like this has caused me to heavily rely on my mother for everything and even now, if I need help I will never even consider asking my father about anything. He’s always been a childish adult and I think I’ve grown to resent that, even seeing other childish adult men sets some kind of disdain off in my brain that makes me feel negatively towards them - even if I haven’t interacted with them. Maybe this stems from having 3 siblings and so having to constantly take care of them while growing up cause my dad wouldn’t??

Recently, my parents have split up and so my dad has gone from never being home to being home for at least a couple days a week (cause they’re tryna split time with us). I hate it. I hate is so much when he’s home, it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even like it when my mother is home; I just want to be alone. I don’t know if this is just cause I am stressed with upcoming A-Levels or what but I am genuinely coming to despise both of my parents. A week ago my mum had a go at me for always asking her for help rather than my dad and now I just don’t want to tell anyone any of my problems or emotions (am I just being dramatic?!) I’m constantly arguing with my dad, and he calls me childish for arguing back but he’s an adult too. Why should I be the reasonable one when he’s 3x my age, and when he’s usually started the whole thing. Whenever he tries to give me advice I hate it because I feel like he’s criticising me and small actions that he does such as chewing or pronunciation of some words really set me off. I dislike being around him at all. 

My mum is constantly talking on the phone so this new guy who she keeps saying is just a friend but it’s pretty obvious he’s more than that. She’s been sneaking out the house on days that she has custody, going around the house to not set the ring doorbell off, so my dad won’t see her leaving. (He keeps arguing that now she isn’t spending enough time with us, her kids) and I know she’s spent the last 17 years purely focused on us, so I get it. But I heard her talking to this guys child on the phone, so I know she’s been spending time with his kid but can’t be bothered to stay with us?? I get that she’s finally got some time to herself but now it’s like she doesn’t care about us anymore. 

I think I hate my dad, and I’m starting to hate my mother. I feel bad because they have never really hit me and they’ve provided me with clothes and such. But I’ve just really started to dislike any interaction with either of them.

1kf986m,Mystery Sister…,Different-Snow1807,"I (34M) live a fairly comfortable, happy life. It’s my partner, my dog, and me— nothing too unusual. We both work a fair deal and make life work. I have a sister, let’s call her Rosa (my half-sister on my mother’s side— this will be important later)— whom I grew up with. We lived pretty ordinary lives, living in the mountains, kinda the middle of nowhere, but also not. Let’s put it like this: we had two Walmarts 45 minutes from us in either direction. Rosa and I are born 8 years apart. Originally, the family transplanted from one of the larger cities in the US. I was still very young, so I have next to no memories of it. 

Flashback some years back. I want to say I was 10-ish and I remember going through family photos and seeing a lot of what you would expect, except for this one picture that just seemed a little out of place. It was a little girl, but it wasn’t Rosa or any other family member or friends of the family that I could think of, so I remember turning it over and seeing the name— let’s call her Claire— written on the back. At some point in time, I brought the picture to my mother and asked her who the little girl was. I got a very runaround answer— no real details but just enough to feed the mind of a 10-year-old that would get them out of your hair. 

Growing up through the years, I would still sometimes bring up this photo because something about it and how our mother reacted to it just seemed a little off. Every time I would ask our mother about it. She would very slowly over the years give little bits of detail by the time I was 24. I had a very piece-together story and it was treated like one of those big family secrets. All my sister and I could really get between us. Was something along the lines of my father, Rosa’s stepfather, had another relationship when he was younger. During this relationship, my father potentially had a daughter, but all this was told to us by our mother, who she says, was told by my late paternal grandmother, whom I had no relationship with after my family left the city and a little bit of complicated backstory.

Flash forward to 2024. I remember being out to lunch with my partner and a friend, getting some sushi, doing nothing special, and getting a very strange message from my cousin I have, whom I very rarely speak with. We weren’t closer or anything. All this message generally said was “Hey cousin, so I got this really weird match on ancestry.com and they sent me a message asking about your father.” ….. Of course, I’m instantly curious because this just seems odd. After talking to my cousin a little more, I found out that Claire reached out to her claiming to be my father‘s daughter.

1kf62gh,My family Problems 🙄😒 (✨Filipino Edition✨),Unable-Tree6262,"Let’s get annoyed together 😀

Hi, I’m just here to rant about my family. I know not everyone is perfect blah blah blah, but there are just some things that annoy me so freaking much.

⚠️Buckle up buttercup. Get ur glasses and some snacks bc good god this is long. Oh and trigger warning if ur homophobic or whatever.⚠️

For context I’m Filipino, my parents and their siblings came to America, and procreated like many other immigrants. The reason being, “a better life,” as that’s usually the reason. So that makes me second generation. Let’s say half of my family went on to go get blue collared jobs, while the other half just couldn’t let go of their old ways (remember that). When I say “old ways” I mean like working hours on a farm, growing plants, selling them, and forcing their own kids to work with them. And before you say, “child labor” or whatever, earning money is hard, and heck why not teach your kids the family trade and how you make money for the family. This was one good thing that helped shaped some of us, it made us humble and learned to appreciate things more yk(I say some bc there were the few spoiled brats). I don’t blame them at all, farming is good honest hard-work. And it’s nothing to be ashamed for but, it’s not for everyone. Here we go-

Note:(These are in no particular order, or ranked a certain way)

Problem #1: CONTROL
Farming. As I’ve mentioned, farming is how some of my family lived and worked to get by. Love or hate it, but never look down on it. Now what’s the problem? You ask? It’s the fact that for me personally my family created a business out of it. That’s good right? Yes, it is. However it’s the fact that my parents tried to really PUSH me and my siblings into joining the family business. When I say push I mean force us to work and operate things. To them it’s easier to hire family bc they can easily “control” us. Heck my older sister had to major in business in college so they could shackle her to doing the taxes, invoices, emails(online work) for the business. While my mom handled paper work and work logs, and me and my other sister did loading/unloading cargo, packs the products, quality control(physical labor). And it’s not like animals or eggs. NO, it’s plants, produce, grows in the soil big ass plants, grows in acres of land shit. I used to like our family farm but grew to dislike it bc of all that work AND pressure from my parents. When my sisters got jobs their farm work lessened, but when I tried to get a job I was told no. Yes, my parents told me no. Why? Because they decided that my only opinions were our family farm or other relatives farms. 🧍‍♀️Like WTF. I DONT WANT TO WORK ON ANY DAMN FARM. I was 16 when I asked that bc I wanted money. Not under the table money, not mommy or daddies money, my own money, made from my sweat and tears at a job of MY choice. Like I get it I guess?? Not everyone wants to work on a farm and finding workers is harder, but that doesn’t mean you can keep me here. So where’s my dad in all of this, well news flash he’s the “boss” He calls the shots, takes the calls, makes the connections. He has the final say(besides my mom) in what goes and stays. And remember how I said they like to “control” us, if anyone of us did something wrong or messed up even by a little we would get it. BOOM! An earful, a whole ass scolding, lecture whatever you name it. AND bc we’re “family,” objects came into play. His hand could be a weapon, those standing fans, the tv, a hanger, slipper, etc. We’re their own kids but sometimes it was hard for them to see that. Love?? Tough love??? Where?? Puhh-lease. Spare me the details on the wild goose chase for love. 

Problem #2: SEXISM
Like most Filipino families or just families in general who have to deal with power dynamics or perhaps sexism, suffocating gender roles, etc. Mine clearly just can’t get rid of it. Welcome to my experiences as a young woman. I’ll mainly be talking about my mothers side of the family for this part. My mothers family (those who have immigrated to the u.s. at least) consists of my grandparents, and their kids(my mom+ her siblings) of 7. Those 7 are 3 girls and 4 boys. Out of 7 only 6 ended up creating families of their own with the 7th/youngest spending his days trying to woo a woman. Each family had either 2-5 kids, with the average being 5. And most of those kids ended up being girls. That’s where I come in. Being a girl in itself is always a challenge. BUT being a girl in a semi-sexist family… well it definitely ain’t any easier. All the girls in the family end up being smart (or at least make smarter decisions), pretty, respectful, fierce with a little bit of ✨trauma✨. When I mean trauma, oh boy it varies. As for all the boys in the family…I suppose they’re not so smart, a lil stupid, nice, and hella stubborn (except for some the younger ones, they’re sweethearts). Now you’re probably wondering how odd my descriptions are but I can assure it comes with a good reason. Discipline. Yes, what starts this whole shift in treatment is how we were all disciplined. Here’s an example of how things usually go. Say we have a brother and sister, they ask they’re parents if they can go out and hang out with some friends. Simple, right? No. Ofc it’s isn’t SIMPLE or FAIR. The parents say that the brother can go, heck they quickly dismiss him to leave already. And the sister? The mom is already on her ass about a secret boyfriend, getting pregnant, staying out too late, doing bad things, the whole sha-bang. And the dad? He stays firm, raises his voice to say she is not allowed to go. As all this is happening, the boy is out and about being reckless in someone else’s car, probly drinking, getting hurt. Do you see it yet. The huge ass gap, right there between what a girl vs. boy can do. And heck even if the brother comes back in the morning hung over, they brush him off as being a “boy”. Still don’t see it? Okay here’s another. It’s a big party, maybe a debut for a just turned 18 daughter celebrating her womanhood (like a Quinceanera or a sweet 16). Everyone is having fun, laughing, enjoying the food and DRINKS. Drinks huh? The girl that has just turned 18 is hanging out with all the adult cousins and they bring out some shots. Can she drink? Ding ding ding! That right, SHE CANT! Her parents give her a look that could kill. But look at that the younger boy cousins who aren’t even 18 or 21, and they’re drinking beer. A shot of alcohol vs bottle of beer. Do you feel angry yet. Do you feel annoyed that these boys aren’t being disciplined the same way as the girls. It’s because these parents don’t stop the boys from doing stupid shit, that they think it’s okay. Heck if the girl breathes even a little, gets too fat, isn’t “lady-like”, isn’t home by 10, isn’t this or that she’s probly already grounded. And thus I introduce ✨depression✨. Yay now she has depression from the inequality. 🎉🥳 oh? 🤨 why aren’t you celebrating? My aren’t the parents happy that they’ve restricted they’re daughter SO MUCH to the point of depression so she doesn’t get hurt?? All the parents think about right now is providing for the family, they have everything to give their kids a good life. So why is they’re beloved daughter not-so-happy. Oh well, they’ll probly ground her for being an ungrateful child. Hey remember, she’s 18, she can finally leave that wretched place!!! Far far away, but oh no? That’s a big no-no from her parents. And thus they’ve guilt tripped her into staying. Gosh! That was a looooot huh? Do you need one more. Okay just one. My OWN experience. When I was younger maybe 5 or so, I would hang out at my cousins house after school. I’d stay there until my parents got off work to pick me up. At my cousins house we’d play all sorts of games, animals, cards, house, best coconut leaf whistle, potion making, etc. Everyone was chill, girls together and boys together. But at some point my boy cousins (let’s call them ER & EM) took the initiative in making MY life miserable. Yes me. (Idk why, and I haven’t asked them till this day bc they’ve changed for the better.) Every day after school ER & EM would bully me till I cried. They insulted me, took my things, trashed my bag, heck stole my snack, push me Yk “usual” bully things. It got so bad to the point 5 year old me wanted to walk home in the middle of the road. Yes I wanted to 💀. All I ever did was be nice to them, bc I was told that I should “treat others how I wanted to be treated” At school they’re angels but at home? Devils. I ended up not going to their house anymore and being picked up and dropped off SEPARATELY. Our parents have talked it out, and they’ve been scolded repeatedly but nothing got through their hard heads. But only their sweet father did the scolding(I felt bad for him), their mother?? Oh for the love of god, SHE FUCKING BABIED THEIR ASSES. No wonder the scolding didn’t get through their heads. ALL THAT BREATHE WASTED ON TRYING TO STOP UR HORRIBLE CHILDREN FROM KILLING YOUR NIECE AND YOU BABY THEM. She felt so fucking bad for her sons more than her niece that wanted to 💀. Heck even Niki’s mom saw what I was trying to do at the time and stopped me. Of course I wasn’t alone, one of my closest cousins had a heart, RIAN. My sister even tried to get them back but boys being boys, laughed it off. That shit didn’t stop until middle school, but by that time the damage was done. My once happy go lucky child self died to become more reserved and insecure. While I got bullied they got babied. Equal exchange right? According to their mom it definitely was. Ngl I’m still salty about them throwing away my hard earned Pokémon cards. Take it all in baby, we’re still not done.

Problem #3: GRANDCHILDREN WHEN?
Associating women with children. It’s been a combo since the beginning of time or whatever. (I’ll still be talking about my mothers side of the family) Let’s be real here, I ain’t gonna get mushy over kids or babies. I don’t have baby fever, and quite frankly neither do most of my cousins. I’m a girl, if you havent figured it out yet lol. I never saw the appeal when I was younger, maybe only bc I was playing house to pass time. I’m older now, not a child anymore so the aunties and uncles are asking if I have a bf or gf(I’ll come back to this) or any kind of relationship. That’s the usual as relatives do, get all up in your business 🙄. They don’t actually care (some of them) and are just nosy. ANYWAYS. I may not be at the age of serious baby talks but you know who is? That’s right fellow reader, my sisters. I’ve mentioned that they both have jobs but, they also have boyfriends of their own. Good for them. Oh no here comes my FATHER!!! Yes my father. I wonder what he wants. “When are you having kids?” HUHHH??! I get that they’re old enough but like kids?? In this economy tho?? That’s all parents ask their kids for when they get old. And my father of all people who literally demanded to have grandchildren, a man asking for a woman to go through all that fucking pain for some kids. I get it, he’s getting old and my pet cat won’t suffice as his grandchild(my cat is my child lol). So his next best options are my older sisters in hopes that they’ll make some babies. And yes they will, but for by their own choice to. Good lord. That should be enough right? RIGHT??? Nah. You thought wrong. Back to me. My parents ask if I’m planning to have kids. “HELL NO” I’ve already said I hate/dislike kids. If I did have ANY/ at all, MAYBE one. The chances of that happening tho are very, very, very, VERY slim. I don’t want to buss my own body up to birth a child. I like being single and free, it’s hard enough to take care of myself. But a kid, my own offspring who will probly suffer from the same mental illness given to me by my parents. As if! I’d rather date a women and not have any kids (my blood or not). Yes a women. Oh and slight warning, I like both men and women. Yes both. Here’s where the next problem comes in. 

Problem #4: STUCK TO THE OLDWAYS/MINDSET
Piggybacking off of the last problem of my ✨sexuality✨, I am bisexual. Meaning I like both men and women. Why is that a problem you ask again for the 100th time probly? Well, not everyone accepts that. They don’t agree with same gender couples having a love life. And that’s okay, we all don’t see things the same, and we don’t need to. Just respect or ignore em. We’re harmless. However, the thought of my parents precious daughter living her life with no kids, let alone with a WOMAN is barbaric and “wrong”. (There is nothing wrong, I’m being dramatic for the explanation) My family or mainly the women who have come straight from the Philippines have a certain mindset that has been hardwired into them the moment they’ve been born. Or rather those who have grown up with the idea of glorifying being married to a man, be a good wife, having a family, showing off your kids or something. Then take those ladies and put them into America but fast forward to when being gay is normal. HALT! It’s not normal to these women. And it will never be because they’re stuck to their “oldways” or “the Bible”. A man + women couple is the only thing they consider valid or acceptable. And for me I had to find out the hard way of their TRUE opinions of gay/lesbian couples. Like most people who’ve struggle to come out to their friends or families, I have come to the conclusion to NEVER come out. Why? My parents or mainly my mother does not accept same sex couples/ marriages. For things to make a little more sense, let’s take a trip down memory lane. A few years ago, around the time my younger cousin (let’s call her “CC”) started to date boys. Every relationship was shit and toxic. Until that is when, she started to experiment with girls. Maybe kiss one or two idk. But one day CC brought me and my older cousin (let’s call her Niki) to talk in private. And in confidence CC shared that she was Lesbian, we both accepted her and treated her normal. Time skip a little to when CC is in a serious relationship with her gf RY. Now she is ready to finally come out. FULLY. To her parents and her family. The beans are spilled. Everyone knows now, but still have mixed opinions, the girls are chill we still love her. The boys don’t give a flying fuck. THE ADULTS. That’s were drama starts. All the aunties have a 2 cents they want to give and the uncles are chill, they acknowledge CC & RY. So where are CC’s parents?? HELLA disappointed in their oldest daughter turning gay. What’s worse? They treat her with EVEN more restrictions and rules because she came out. Heck they openly dislike everything. They talk shit about their own daughter to relatives (my mother being one of them). But is this affecting any of them? No. It’s her life not theirs. SO WHAT SO HARD to understand?? Back to the present. I’m with my mom in the car on our way to Niki’s house. I tell my mother that I’ll be going to hang out with some friends on the weekend. She asks who, I say blue hair, she says “are you sure she’s not your gf?” But with the most concerned look of dread. Hint1. I respond is saying she’s just a friend and it’s only lunch. My mother sighs in relief. “She better not be your gf”Hint2. HUHH?? Okay now I’m curious. Before we get out of the car I ask we this. “Hey mom, what do you think of CC being lesbian?” I wait in anticipation, my gut is clenched as I stare at my mom waiting for her response. “CC is JUST CONFUSED, she’ll realize that she is wrong. And will be with a man.” (Those words sucker punched any thought of coming out at all. At least not to my family. And it killed any respect I had for my mother that night) My mother spoke so stern and annoyed. My gut dropped, my eyes fighting the urge to not look angry or disappointed. All I can muster is an “oh” and get out of the car. I bolted to go tell Niki what I had just heard. I hated- no I loathed my mothers response so much. I promised to never tell CC what I heard that night bc she likes my mom. (Ik I’m protecting a hater but she’s still my mom) I knew my mother talked to CC’s dad because that’s her brother. And I thought they would just listen to each other’s problems. So why didn’t I think that maybe she’s grown to dislike same sex couples even more. So many thoughts races though my head that night, yet there wasn’t one that would consider the hate and disgust I’d gotten from my mothers response. There’s more instances of my homophobic family but that’s for another time. My head hurts now

Thank you for reading this far. Here’s a gold star 🌟. I know there’s worse, as in my family and others but for now I’ll end this one here. But if you’ve made it this far, I have some questions for y’all. Feel free to answer any. 

- what are your thoughts on all of this?
- did you relate?
- did you feel anything?
- what is your position in YOUR family? (Ex: parent/ middle child/ grandparents idk)

I’m just curious what are y’all views on such matters. And how it’s been handled or would’ve been handled in your family. ",2,0,1746431620.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kf62gh/my_family_problems_filipino_edition/
1kf58bs,Am I the butthole for not listening to my sister?,SnooGoats339,"My sister unfollowed me and says she don’t want to talk anymore out of nowhere but I’m starting to catch on now.. 

Me(20f) and my sister(19f) were always close ever since we were born. She started dating this guy(20 now) and things were great you know? I knew this guy because he was also a close friend of my friend. They broke up last year and things were cool. They ended on good terms. Me and the guy still talked because duh we have the same friends we know each other. My sister started to act weird towards him or whatever. Not really my business because people take breaks up differently. She then proceeded to tell me to stop hanging out with him because it made her uncomfortable. I don’t know how because one I’m LESBIAN and two I’m in a committed relationship and three I know him because of our shared friend. I was weirded out by the request but I told him what was up and he understood and I stopped talking to him. 

Fast forward to earlier this year, our older sister(20f) pulled me off to the side and talked to me. She told me the reason why our little sister wanted us to stop talking to him was because she thought we were going to take him and she didn’t want him to end up with us or something. Mind you our big sister is engaged!! She don’t even talk to the guy. And I found that disgusting and disrespectful. We confronted our little sister and she said it was weird that we were talking to her ex. We both know damn well why she thought that. I cut off a really good friend that I’ve known for years over my little sister being all up in her feelings. Thinking I want him?? IM LESBIAN!! I’ve been out since I was in elementary school! I never liked men, I can’t date them!! So of course I reached out to him to check up on him. 

He’s fine and he also confirmed what my big sister said about why our little sister thought it was weird that we were talking to him before she told us to stop. It was because she thought I would go after him.. despite my sexuality she told him that there’s a chance I could date men.. what the fuck?? I’m comfortable in my sexuality ma’am.. so I just went back to hanging out and texting him. She blocked our older sister because she didn’t care that she was talking to him still. They stopped talking to each other. But recently I’ve been in and out of the er and I’ve been talking to the guy. And he told me that he told my little sister about my er visit. And she told him it was weird that I started talking to him again. Yesterday she unfollowed me and said she don’t want to talk to me. Am I the asshole or is she being immature?? She’s entitled to what she’s feeling but you can’t take a friend away that I’ve known for a hot minute.",2,0,1746427924.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kf58bs/am_i_the_butthole_for_not_listening_to_my_sister/
1kf10m2,AITA for being mad at my parents,Princesspussy911,"So earlier today me (F23) and my parents (mainly my dad) got into an argument about how they were so strict with me when I was growing up (to the point where I depend on them for a lot of stuff nowadays which is bad for my age) compared to how they treat my sister now who’s 19. 

I was telling them how it’s not fair that they let her do whatever she wants and barely ground her or discipline her whenever she acts up but if I were to do the same thing when I was her age I would be on house arrest, grounded, or have my phone taken away. They said they’re trying not to make the same mistakes that they did with raising me, but I feel like they want her to succeed by giving her this freedom while I’m still struggling to be independent due to them not teaching me certain life skills, making me stay at home and focus on schoolwork, and Covid/quarantine. 

The worst part is that my parents couldn’t even apologize for creating these problems for me or whenever I ask my dad for help with something he gets mad bc he’s the type to get upset about everything. So basically what I’m asking is, AITA for crashing out on my parents (well mainly my dad) about my frustrations on being treated differently as a first born/eldest daughter?? And how do I get over these feelings and deal with my dad since he doesn’t wanna really take accountability or change his toxic behavior?? Let me know if you want more details on what happened bc there’s a lot of stuff that happened in this argument but it’s too much to type out for this post 😭😭 ",1,0,1746412152.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kf10m2/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_parents/
1kf03b8,I don’t feel comfy with my little sister anymore.,Due-Brilliant-3601,"Two years ago, I brought my sister (16 years old, now 18) from the Dominican Republic to Canada so she could have a better life. She lives with me, my partner, and my two young kids. From the beginning, I asked her to help around the house — even something as basic as doing the dishes at night — but she’s never followed through.

Two weeks ago, I spoke to her about the bedroom she shares with my kids because it was in a terrible state. Despite that talk, she hasn’t even swept the floor. I cook, clean, and do everything. She only washes her own dishes (not even the pots) and won’t take any initiative. She wakes up late, plays on her phone all day, and does absolutely nothing else. Sometimes she goes without deodorant for a month just because she won’t go out to buy one.

She doesn’t contribute financially, even though I only asked her to help with $100 a month (to cover her phone and help a little with groceries). This month, she gave me what she owed for two months, but I feel she only did it because I pushed her, not because she feels responsible.

I spoke to her mother (who raised her) to ask for advice, and she said: “Ask her what she likes to do and assign her that as a responsibility.” That response really upset me. I don’t get to choose what I like — I cook, clean, and do it all because it’s necessary. She’s an adult, and there’s no real effort on her part.

I’m physically and emotionally drained. I feel like her presence is no longer sustainable. She takes up space, doesn’t respect my privacy, doesn’t help, and I’m worried my kids will grow up thinking this behavior is okay.

I’m seriously considering sending her back to the Dominican Republic once this school year ends, even if it means she’ll need to finish high school there. I don’t want to carry this burden anymore. It hurts, but if I don’t act, I feel like I’ll explode.

Am I being unfair? Has anyone gone through something like this?",21,30,1746409166.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kf03b8/i_dont_feel_comfy_with_my_little_sister_anymore/
1keylqe,My mother’s at it again…,Low-Thanks-4316,"My mother has done me so wrong, and she continues to try to ruin me. She used my vulnerability (because she’s my mother) by pretending to have my back. She used and still uses everything that I tell her (personally) and twists it to make it seem like I am a fault. 

She had been running this narrative that I’m a horrible person who drinks too much and does drugs. At one point in my life I did drink too much and did drugs, but then I realized that it’s what her and her other children do to me that I find myself doing those things. I’ve been sober for 6 years. Something she will never acknowledge.

I’m not sure who’s crazier, her or the people that believe her. She told people that I “wanted to be homeless.” Who in their right mind would say and do that? So she told people I was crazy - justifying her claim of me wanting to be homeless - but now that’s backfiring on her. She turned my oldest son and daughter against me by calling them to tell them that I made her cry. She doesn’t tell them what she says to me though.

I’ve shared about this before only now I wish I could strangle her. Of course, I won’t. I’ve learned that patience is a virtue, the truth will always set you free, and God sees my struggle and hears my prayers.

1kevbai,AITA,Swimming_Stranger_79,"Bit of backstory my aunty was diagnosed with breast cancer over a year ago. She told my mother and I not to tell her parents (estranged 30 years). I don’t speak to this aunty. I live the the same state as her parents (my grandparents) Everyone else is in another state, I regularly see my grandparents but agreed I will not mention it. A few months go by and my aunty posts on Facebook about her cancer.… which includes many many family members liking and commenting that have contact with her parents (my grandparents). I still don’t say anything to my grandparents as she is rarely mentioned in any conversations we have. Another few months go by and a family member passes away. Most family members attend (grandparents attend via live stream due to health and age). I go to their house about a week after this funeral and aunty’s name gets bought up as she was seen on live stream and grandparents both awkwardly stare at me as if to say “do you know about the cancer” so I say “well I guess from the funeral you’ve heard about aunty” and they both say no. So I simply say “I’m probably now in the shit but oh well it’s on Facebook, she’s got breast cancer” nothing else is said. 
Fast forward and aunty finds out they know. She blows up. I apologise and explain why I even said anything  and she can’t see that posting it on Facebook gave me the impression she’s in the open about it. Anyway a few months go by and this week she rings my mum saying she’s in therapy and on anti depressants because of what I did…. Am I seriously the arsehole here??

1ketnin,Griefs and my father cheating on my mother.,Ordinary_Boats,"Hello, I hope you're doing well. Here’s the situation: I’m 25 (F). I’m writing to you because I’ve been through a lot in the past few months and I need to talk about it.

On January 21st, my maternal grandfather passed away from cardiac arrest at 68 years old. It was my first time experiencing grief, and I took it very badly. Then, on March 20th, my maternal grandmother passed away as well, from a stroke, at 70 years old. It was another huge shock.

Then, on April 19th, a week after my birthday, my paternal grandmother passed away. Her death was more “expected” because she had been suffering from Alzheimer’s for over ten years and had been in a nursing home for eight years. She hadn’t recognized us for a long time, but she was the grandmother I was closest to, and losing her really shook me.

What made it even harder was that we had to wait ten days before the funeral because of the crematorium and church availability. Those ten days felt so long and painful.

On top of all that, there were big problems with my father’s family. They criticized my sister and me, insulted us for no valid reason. For example, they reject my sister 31 (F) because she’s a lawyer, saying that lawyers defend criminals and that it’s not a respectable profession. As for me, I’m studying to become a legal assistant, and that’s not acceptable to them either because I’m still “in the law.” From what I’ve heard, it’s actually my cousin 29 (F) who’s causing problems.

It’s extremely hard to deal with grief while also having family members who don’t respect you. For example, we had all chosen songs for my grandmother’s funeral, but the two songs my sister and I had picked were removed from the ceremony.

On top of all this, my parents argue all the time. They haven’t loved each other for a long time and should have divorced already. My father M (56) blames my mother F (61) for not being there for him during his grief, but he himself wasn’t there for my mother’s losses earlier this year and in March. They constantly criticize and fight, unable to support each other.

During those ten days, my father’s family, who had come from Lyon and were causing problems, stayed the whole time. My father insisted we see them because, for him, “that side of the family” came before the four of us: my sister, my mother, him, and me. It was such a tough ordeal, and everyone suffered.

But today, I also found out something else. I looked at my father’s phone because I had a bad feeling, and I discovered that he’s cheating on my mother. This isn’t the first time: when I was 15, he was already contacting escorts. I told my mother back then. He swore they were just messages, that he never went any further, but I didn’t believe him because I had already caught him before without saying anything. When I exposed him, it caused huge fights, and my mother never trusted him again.

He still holds it against me today for telling the truth, blaming me for looking at his phone and for talking about it, as if it were my fault.

Recently, while we were staying at our vacation home to try and recover from everything, I saw messages where he invited someone to come over, with winking emojis and very suggestive messages. He had renamed the contact “St Yriex” which is the city she lives in and deleted their conversations.

My sister also found out things: when she went to pick up a package at Sephora, they gave her a parcel my father had ordered—a perfume that wasn’t for my mother, or for me, or for my sister. He took the package, but we’ve never seen that perfume at home, and my sister is convinced he gave it to someone else.

She also told me that when I was younger, she had once caught him sending heart emojis to another woman and had confronted him about it. This behavior has been going on for a long time.

My sister says she doesn’t know what to do. On one hand, if I tell, she thinks my mother will stay anyway, that nothing will change, and that I’ll just get yelled at again. She says it’s their responsibility, not ours. But on the other hand, I’m struggling with the fact that my mother keeps calling him affectionate names, pretending in front of others, while at home they’re always fighting and saying they hate each other.

I still live with them while I finish my studies because I can’t afford to move out, so it’s really hard to distance myself from all this.

My mother doesn’t know anything. It’s also important to know that my mother is visually impaired, so she can’t see, she can’t know who my father is talking to. I feel like my father is kind of taking advantage of her disability.

So, should I add this “revelation” to everything we’re already going through, with all the grief? Are we ready for that? I really don’t know. I just needed an outside opinion, from someone who doesn’t know my father, my mother, my sister, or me.

It’s really weighing on me to act like nothing’s happening.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Wishing you a very good day or evening.

Sorry if my English is not good, it's not my first language.

1kenluw,Younger cousin (15m) trying to inappropriately touch me. (21 F),Haley-K60,"I feel uncomfortable that I even have to ask this but figured Reddit would be a decent place to start until I can figure out what i’m going to do next. I can be anonymous & hopefully get some good feedback without a lot of judgement. Anyways, my little cousin is 15. Im 21 yrs old. He came into my life when he was 8yrs old. My uncle never knew he had a son until his ex girlfriend from years ago reached out to him. He fought in court & won custody of him. He had a very rough upbringing w/ his mother. I see him as family & almost like a little brother so i’m very shocked as to what happened last night. Basically we slept together in the same bed @ my grandmas camper. I didn’t think too much of it as we used to sleep together a lot when we’d stay at my grandmas. I’ve been in college & hadn’t seen him very often for the last few yrs so i’m not sure if maybe he sees me differently now or what?? But basically I woke up to him feeling me up & didn’t know quite what to say. I played it off like I was asleep & should’ve said something but it’s odd as he’s now 15 & it was just genuinely freaky for me in general. I woke up to him trying to touch my private area (crotch) & flipped over. I acted like I was asleep & was just rustling around. This lasted for hours. I kept tossing & turning so he couldn’t keep feeling me up. He did not get to any of my areas luckily but at one point he took my socks off. I grabbed his hand “in my sleep” to try & keep him away from me but then he kept trying to take my hand & would try n move it to his private area. I kept flinching my hand away. I should’ve said something. I understand people are going to tell me that I was wrong to not saying anything but I think I was shocked more than anything. I got up @ one point & acted like I woke up out of the blue. Got up & walked around & tried to find somewhere to sleep but my grandparents were in the other bed, the floor had no space & there was no other chairs. So I got back in & distanced myself as far away as possible. I was thinking that he’d atleast stop bc he knew it’d take me awhile to fall back asleep, but he started up again. So then I KNEW that he must’ve thought I was awake & somewhat ok with it? I don’t know. But I sure as hell was not. I feel very wrong & feel like it’s my responsibility as a 21 yr old woman/his older cousin to have said something. I know this isn’t normal. Maybe when he was younger, I could understand his curiosity but he’s at the age where he knows what he’s doing. He’s also going through puberty & has a lot of hormones. I’m not sure if SA in his past was something to be at play here? I need thoughts & some advice please. How would you go about this? I don’t know if I should say anything to my family or not. This will not happen again bc I will no longer be sharing a bed again w/ him. I saw this as something completely innocent up until all that. Maybe I should’ve known better. I also realized this morning that his pants were in the bathroom on the floor & I went back over to the bed & looked under the blanket & realized he only had his underwear on. I had no clue he was just in his underwear either so that was also another thing that freaked me out. I wont write anymore so i’m leaving it at that.

They always demotivate me and always scold me even for a tiniest thing. But they are not like this with my siblings (im the oldest daughter). No one in my family is with me and I just feel so lonely here. There hasn't been any single day that I've feel guienly happy in my own home. I always felt j I shouldn't have been born here or I should've been born elsewhere but it is not in my hand. Because of them I have lost all my confidence and the desire to live and continue my life.

1ken36z,Vegas Was Canceled Because of Crack (Welcome to the Family),Sad-Construction7275,"I wasn’t born—I was offered, like a favor nobody really knew how to say no to.

Sharon, my aunt, was at the hospital, chain-smoking and casually called her sister Mila, like she was offering her a stray cat:
“Hey, so Lisa and Chuck had another baby. You want it?”

Mila blinked. “What are you talking about? This isn’t a dog.”

But this is how things happened in our family. If you tried to map the relationships, you’d end up with a family tree that looked like it was drawn by a drunk spider.

Sharon had every reason to be at that hospital—not because she was especially close to Lisa or Chuck, but because her husband Blart was Chuck’s brother. And just to add a little extra chaos, Sharon had actually dated Chuck before marrying Blart. You following so far?

Now Lisa and Chuck were back at it—having babies they couldn’t keep. Mila and her husband George—my soon-to-be dad—were supposed to be headed to Vegas that weekend. George had just retired from the Air Force. They were finally about to breathe.

Their son Tony had just been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was slipping into crack addiction. Their daughter Leah had recently gotten married—after I came into the family. I was already in the wedding pictures, being passed around like a party favor in a frilly dress two sizes too big. Nobody was really sure who I belonged to, but I smiled anyway. That’s kind of how it went for a while.

It was a full house—too full, honestly.

So when Mila got that call, George was on his way home from work. He turned the car around, came in with tears in his eyes, and said it was a sign from God.

Vegas was off. Parenthood was back on.

I was born premature—tiny, fragile, already tangled in chaos. Lisa and Chuck, my birth parents, were deep in addiction. I wasn’t their first kid. My older brother—Buzz—was already tangled up in the system by the time I came into the world. For a while, the story was that he was living with two lesbian dopeheads up in Houston. And honestly? That was considered a step up given the mess behind us.

But eventually, he was adopted by Timothy—Chuck’s other brother. Timothy was the one who had it together: well off, no drug problems, stable. He even tried to adopt me too.

So there I was: handed over through a hospital hallway, not born into a plan, but into a pause.

My adoption wasn’t neat. It came with old romantic drama, broken homes, and whispered warnings. But Mila and George didn’t hesitate. They chose me when they could’ve walked away. That part matters.

One night in Hutto, when I was still young and trying to piece it all together, George sat at the edge of my bed and told me, “Sometimes parents give up on their kids. Life’s just like that. Messy. Unfair. But it’s not your fault.”

He said it soft, almost like he wasn’t talking to me, but to the version of himself that never heard those words growing up. His own dad had walked out too.

I didn’t know it yet, but I’d carry those words with me for years—especially when I eventually came face-to-face with Lisa and Chuck. But we’ll get to that later.

For now, all you need to know is this:

I didn’t come into the world through the front door. I came in through a back hallway, past the smoke and the secrets, handed over like a whispered warning. And even then, before I could spell trauma or understand what a cycle was, I knew one thing for sure—

This ends with me.

1kel99r,I’m so tired of my mum.,Leading_Advantage103,"Im so tired of my mum.

I love her, but it gets tiring at a point. It annoys me to see how none of my friends mums complain to them about their fucking money. Everything about my mum is about money, i dont even know anything about her. It’s like we live in 2 different worlds. I never see her and if i do she always says hurtful things about me. Whenever we go out like grocery shopping or furniture shopping, at the end of the trip, she always compalins. ‘Look how im spending more money on you, why am i always spending so much on you?’ Thats what a mother should be doing, providing and not compaling to their teen daughter about money. Everytime she compalins, she always says it like a joke, but it gets tiring. In the car one time, she complained about how all of her paycheck goes to her kids, me and my siblings, theres 4 of us. She complains about how she never spends the money on herself and always on me and my siblings infront of me. I felt embarrassed for her, as an asian family, we like to show off, tell and show people that we have money, but shes always yelling at us, even in public, complaining how she has no money and its all our fault. She also always complains about how i show no affection to her, shes always comparing me to her workers. They always say ‘i love you’ at the end of a call, but i never do. When i was younger, i loved my mum, i loved her so much id handmake my own cards, everything was about my mum. I made her bracelets and little gifts that were meaningful to me. But soon, i realized she’d just toss them aside and laugh. She never showed affection to me. So i gave up. When i was ten, i completely gave up. It was useless. I never said i love you, i never gave her anything. I just locked myself in my room. I avoided my family throughout until now. Ive had enough. My mum complains about how im never sweet and how im always cold to her. And when i tell her i had been sweet but she never loved me back, she just laughed and said ‘dont lie, why werent you like your little sister?’ I was so close to breaking down. I don’t know what to do anymore. She’s the type to laugh when you do something sentimental and look at you like you’re crazy. I don’t feel like I can say anything to her without feeling guilt or uncomfortable. I feel so guilty.",2,1,1746369303.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kel99r/im_so_tired_of_my_mum/
1keklza,The scapegoat,AggressiveGanache538,"Life back home was tough, but we were managing. Me, my husband, and our little boy decided to take a leap of faith—we left behind everything we knew and loved to move to California, hoping to build a better future.

My mom’s cousin and her kids had been encouraging me to come for a while. Some backstory: I used to spend my summers here during high school and a bit after graduation. I never got along with their daughter, Mia—we constantly butted heads. Her siblings always took her side, and I was often teased for being “rich” because my mom was with a man who supported us generously.

What they didn’t know—or didn’t want to acknowledge—was that I had also lived in a tin house with my dad’s sister. I knew what it was like to grow up with very little. I remember living with my grandmother, crammed into a one-room extension with nearly 10 people. But when I tried to talk about that part of my life, they laughed. They called me a liar.

Still, I believed things had changed. I thought time had matured us all.

When we got here, Mia insisted she be considered one of my son’s godmothers. I said sure—why not? I ended up staying with her sister Layla instead of Mia or their parents, because Layla offered her place, saying she’d be working a lot and I wouldn’t be in anyone’s way. That seemed like the best arrangement.

At first, everything seemed okay. But there was always tension—like I was walking on eggshells.

One day, my husband and I got into an argument. He needed space and went to hang out with George, Mia’s brother. That’s when Mia called me. I told her we had a disagreement, and she said, “Oh, you’re always being dramatic, Kellie.” I didn’t want to deal with that energy, so I hung up.

She showed up at Layla’s house, uninvited, and started scolding me: “You’re so dramatic. You want your son to be a child of divorce like you? This is what you’re teaching him?” I tried to calmly explain that she didn’t know the whole story. I was never a runaway—I just moved between family when I needed a break, and I liked spending time with my grandma and aunt.

But she kept going, accusing me of being selfish and a bad mom. I told her, “I’ll literally go to a shelter. I’m not doing this with anyone right now.” Then she said it again: “You’re selfish. You need to be a better mother. You’re a bad mother.” That’s when I snapped. I hit her.

Layla stepped in. Things got heated, but eventually settled. Then, radio silence from everyone for days. I said I’d leave, but they insisted I stay.

On Easter Sunday, I was with Uncle Tim and Auntie Lisa when they got a call from Mia’s parents—they wanted a family discussion. Uncle Tim asked me what happened. I told them the truth, and they sided with me. They said Mia has always been a bully and deserved to be called out.

I understand what I did was wrong, but I also know my mental health has been in a fragile state. I always try to be upfront about my boundaries, but they keep getting crossed.

When I tried to apologize to Auntie Janice, she said, “I know my daughter’s a bully, but what you did still isn’t excusable.” I agree that what happened wasn’t right—but where’s the accountability for Mia?

Two weeks later, Layla decided to kick me out. She moved our mattress to their parents’ house.

Mia called me to apologize, but not without a few final jabs first. She claimed she had nothing to do with how things escalated. I told her how she made me feel. We set boundaries, and that was that.

Since moving in with Mia’s parents, things have only gotten worse. I’ve been constantly nitpicked and scolded for every little thing—especially chores. Meanwhile, Uncle Tim’s son, who also stays here, does nothing. He leaves dishes everywhere, and I get blamed. They even started calling family back home, saying I neglect my son because I’m always on my phone.

Here’s the irony:
	•	Their daughter once told her mom she was molested by her uncle, and her mom called her a liar.
	•	Mia once called her brother a rapist and a cheater—and when that audio came out, the family was more concerned about who recorded it than whether it was true.
	•	They’ve witnessed their eldest daughter abusing her kids—one child has a bald spot from pulling his own hair, and he can’t even read because she pulled him out of school.

Yet I’m the one labeled the problem.

They act like the perfect family, but no family is perfect. What hurts is that they felt the need to involve more family—now my cousin back home is being warned not to come here because I’ll “make it bad” for her too. Thankfully, she stood up for me and said they weren’t telling the whole story.

This has all spiraled into something I never imagined. I thought we were starting a new chapter—but now I just want to leave. I need to focus on getting out and starting over, again. For my son. For my peace.

One of my older cousins back in Guam recently reached out. She said something that really stuck with me—that she thinks I’ve always just been an easy target. “It’s easy to point fingers at you,” she told me. “Everyone still sees you as that ‘troubled kid.’”

But I was never troubled. I was just a kid trying to understand where I belonged in a broken home. I moved around a lot—not because I was running away or being difficult, but because I was searching for safety, for peace, for something that felt like home.

What she said helped me realize something I hadn’t seen clearly before: the family didn’t really know me. They projected their own pain and judgments onto me. Instead of trying to understand my story, they made me the scapegoat. They chose to believe the worst about me, and once that label stuck, it didn’t matter how much I grew or changed.

It’s heartbreaking to feel like no matter how far you come, some people will always see you as the version of yourself that fit their narrative. And in this family, that narrative has become a cycle—a pattern of denial, projection, and silence.

This is a continuation to a couple of my last posts. I’ve decided now that I need to get out of here as soon as possible .. once I’m out i will not be in contact with any of them. I know the consequences and downsides with staying with people from other experiences . I know it’s never easy.. but this all just sucks.

1keg7pv,Hash it out or take turns being upset???,LP-MERCHANT,"People live together and not always in a good way.

Some people might demand to ""hash things out"" or try to turn the conversation into ""we were both upset"".

These unofficial models of conversation can hurt people and make painful connections.

The longer things are left the worse the feelings can become.

If a conversation is a disagreement, there does not need to be one person victorious over the other. Invite to good reasoning and ethics rather than belittling the other person. Advise away from not good reasoning or cruelty rather than demonising the other person. 

It might be that there are two people upset at one another for different matters but mistreatment is not the same as a dislike. When a person mistreats another it is better that they seek forgiveness and make effort to treat the other better and avoid their past mistake. Forgiveness and reconciliation are good and they both are needed to maintain good connections. If a person tried to equate a mistreatment to a dislike then they would be enforcing a distortion on another person. That would add mistreatment to mistreatment and would be even further from reconciliation.

People mature through knowledge and experience. Each conversation can improve all people involved. People can enrich each others lives with beneficial knowledge and effort.",1,0,1746352541.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1keg7pv/hash_it_out_or_take_turns_being_upset/

*

My brother has been kicked out of both of my parents homes. I couldn't take him in because he has a past record and I couldn't risk losing my kids. So he and his girlfriend were living in his car homeless in Utah. My brother is now in jail. Originally because he was drunk as a skunk and shirtless. So he was charged with lewdness and intoxication. And later 3 counts of retail theft <$500
 Next part of the story we all agreed because he's been in jail so many times that it would be good to leave him there to sober up. And his girlfriend in the mean time was blowing up our little brothers phone because she wanted him bailed out and she claimed she was pregnant (she's lied about this a lot to get what she wants. She also tried threatening my little brother and tried getting him alone we think to beat him up and robbing him because she lied about having bail money. Well she took my brother who is in jails phone, wallet, car, basically anything he had. And then called my mom who has had some contact before with them and asked her to take her to the hospital for the baby. So my mom took her to the hospital were they sent her to the ER and the ER called the police because the girlfriend was beat up and bruised head to toe. The girlfriend also said that she just lost the baby and my brothers been in jail for 3 days now. She is claiming that my brother beat her so bad she lost the baby. So now my brother has been charged with assault that lead to unconsciousness and tampering with a witness. 

*Backstory on girlfriend*
She's lost all custody of her kids for abuse. Both dads have full custody and she gets no visitation. We have evidence that she was abusing my brother. She's been arrested many times for abuse of her kids, my brother, and two ex husbands. She's an alcoholic. But at the time of hospital visit she was sober.

*Backstory on brother*
Has many different mental illnesses. He gets disability because of how bad things are for him. He's been arrested for public intoxication before, damage of property and assault 1 time 10 years ago. I lived with him for most of my life and he never hit me once. I'm a female and never did I feel scared but I did look at my brother and could easily see he isn't mentally okay. I'm fact I got him set up when a psychiatrist doctor who's been helping. 

*Back to story*
Brother in suicidal off medication so he is in solitary confinement. And no one can reach him. Jail, detectives are all lying to us. We've asked for them to review and we have ask to see body cam footage of when police went to go see my brother (who was so drunk he couldn't get up so he was sleeping in his own poop, pee, and vomit). Because if she was abused why didn't they notice then because this feels like a gabby petito situation all over. And I think police officers who were there should be written up if he did abuse her. Public defender doesn't was to really help. We can't get access to his phone it's in evidence. Girlfriend handed it in when she went to ER but she kept the money and left the state. My brother has been questioned while the jail is sedating him in the middle of the night. And people want to kill him in jail because he's been labeled as a wife beater. I don't know what I can do to help him if anything. Detectives say our evidence doesn't matter and to just show it in court which is virtual and they keep moving court times so we can't attend.
FBI case has been made. 
My family is mad at my mom for getting girlfriend.
I've been told if I have any connection to my mother at all the rest of my family won't talk to me.
I told them that's not fair to give me an ultimatum. Every idea I've had for my brother has been shot down. 
I'm going on a trip with my other family members next month. Can't get my money back $5,000. And my family holds grudges and will make me pay for having any connection with my mom. 
I'm so stressed out. I've been talking with my therapist. Ive attempted suicide in the past for a situation not as bad as this but because they make everything my fault.

1kdvxvg,My Husbands Family,Comprehensive-Mud180,"TL;DR: I am seeking objective (if possible) advice on controlling my DH's issue with playing caretaker/assistant/butler/ATM for his family- and of course...roping me and our finances into it.

Background: My husband and I both come from families that were/are impoverished. Our parents made sure to imbue us with all the parentification they could, and in that way, our childhoods were exactly alike.

The Rest (if you like to read)

My Family

My parents raised me in the worst part of the worst city- evictions, utility shut-offs, and empty fridges par the cour. Finances were never stable, birthdays after age five were never guaranteed, and if I ever went anywhere or did anything, it was because it was a state-sponsored program. My father was an immigrant- he stocked shelves at a local store and did odd jobs to get by, even while his eyesight was being eaten away by a progressive disease. He was one of those guys who found self-worth in womanizing and was quite successful at it, seeing that my mom was 26 years younger than him. The type of guy who aims to be the life of the party and only plans as far as putting one foot in front of the other.

My mother was/is simply a grown woman with daddy issues, who would slowly realize that the ""daddy"" she clung to was, not only a terrible dad to his firstborn children, two of whom were older than her, but also an unsupportive narcissistic spouse. My mother tried to leave at times, especially when my dad ""schooled"" her too often, but she would ritually get roped back into their toxic relationship until I turned 8 and they split for good.

After they split, my mother kept me, and my dad moved into another woman's home until he found a small studio. This move marked the last time my father ever financially assisted my mother with my upkeep and the beginning of my mother's cyclical struggle with homelessness, misandry, and paranoia. Forcing me to drop out of school and follow her from temporary shelter to temporary shelter until adulthood.

As an adult, I did what I was trained to do. I got a job so that my mom could go to school while I paid the rent. I was afraid to leave her side as if she wouldn't make it without me. I also supported my father, who at the time was in an advanced stage of eye disease and homeless- I'd send whatever money I had left after bills to him. All while being relentlessly bullied by neighborhood goblins (I never had the money to afford proper clothes for myself). Once I got the opportunity to, I began working on my education and never looked back. I now hold a master's degree.

My mother is also fairly stable after living with me for close to 6 years. We don't have the best relationship now, but that's beside the point. My dad now has government assistance after years of petitioning for his residency. Long story short- they can both take care of themselves, and I'm working to heal my parentificated inner child.

DH's Family

My DH's family had better means while he was growing up. His father was a politician, his mother was a teacher, and he lived what I (and many others) would call a privileged life. Stable home, food, harmony, many siblings, ""help,"" and what seemed to be a well-managed wealthy family, which quickly spun into chaos after the death of his mother, when he was eight years old.

Soon after that his father's political career spun out of control, and although his grandmother attempted to provide some normalcy by moving in and taking charge of the household, things quickly fell apart. Their government, for reasons still unclear to me, took possession of most of his dad's assests, and their family quickly fell closer to the poverty line. After eight years of petitioning to reclaim his earnings, his father passed away, and his grandmother not long after. This left him and his cousin, the ""leaders"" of the family (both raised in a patriarchal society, and even though all of his sisters are older, he had to assume his position as the head of the family), he was only 17 years old. Following his father's dying wish, he took a sum of over 60k abroad to use for tuition fees and living expenses. Then proceeded to blow it all on women, dropped out of college, and beget a child.

Since then, he's had a second child with a different woman (before meeting me) and finished a technical degree.

His family, however, continues to struggle with poverty even after reclaiming many of their dad's assets. They seem to be extremely invested in upholding an ""image"" which was supposed to die with his father.

The Problem

He and I have built a stable life, bought a home, and are recovering our finances to build an emergency fund, among other things. But his family. keeps. coming. I don't know what impression he is giving them, but our little wealth has been built by blood, sweat, and tears alone. We had no help and no one to lean on during the process- absolutely no one. Every other week, a brother, or nephew, or a sister comes to live with us or has a problem that requires thousands of dollars. What makes it worse, he will take out a loan or borrow money to appease them and tell me only after the deed is done.

I know he loves his family as do I, but the constant leeching is driving me nuts, and the financial burden always falls back on me- whether he's short his half of the mortgage or not able to chip in to buy our son (his second son which I adopted as my own) new clothes. It feels like it will never end! I'm writing this submission as a lifeline- is there any way this will end well?

The issue is that they’re not doing well financially (no surprise there, honestly) they’re so lazy. I truly don’t know what to do with them.

1kdqtaw,At a cross roads right now- long post sorry,FixRevolutionary7646,"Hi everyone I need an outside perspective on a lifetime long issue. I will try to summarize everything to the best that I could remember for some of it. But most of it has only come to light recently so I apologize if there’s any missing details.

So in the past year, I feel like I’ve been broken down by my family dynamic. Mainly with my father and a little bit with my mother. 

For background: I am 23 (M) yro with 3 siblings. My eldest brother who’ll be called John (30) my twin sister who I will call Mary, and the youngest brother (17) who will be called Bob. John recently got married to a great woman who I will call Nancy. my father is a pastor from the southern United States Baptist camp and I’ve been in church nearly my entire life. I lived with my parents even in my adult years since there is no housing available in my price range. I also am in the army as a part time reservist.

So this isn’t the first time that something like this has happened, even though I do not remember much. Around my second grade year my mother and father had lived separately for a time, and my mother lived with her mother and all of the children lived with my dad. All I remember is that it was weird having Mom absence and Living with Dad was strict. There was also a time in my high school senior year, where my dad had exposed my mother for being unfaithful and in order to make the peace, everyone had to give their locations to everybody.

I will not pretend that I didn’t have a regular childhood since I would say that my family was pretty well off financially at least well enough to where mom and dad got new cars almost every two or three years and last year they bought a house together with the hope that when all of the children got married, everyone would come to their house with their children. Although I really don’t remember most of my childhood if I’m being honest. Other than I remember being more free spirited than I am now and conditioned to be the dependable hard-working child. Anyways, growing up was a little bit difficult, mainly in school and how for the longest time I was not allowed to defend myself, and that I eventually became into a people, please and kind of person. And I mainly attribute that to how my father raised me. Such as how the summer was little time for rest since he would have us work during the summer with home improvement projects that ultimately meant nothing in the end. There are times where mom and dad did stick up for me such as how they had to stick up for me while I was having a rough time getting along with my boss who was scheduling me during my military time (which is illegal btw), and how they were able to help me when I got into a car accident in January 2023 since they had my location.

Fast forward to my adult years, I did slowly become more and more strained with my father. Well, honestly say that I’m still trying to live a Christian lifestyle. I’ve grown to know that I mainly went to church out of obligation on accounts of my father. And there were plenty of times where we had plenty of fights, such as I had told my father that I would drop out of college if he tried to force Mary and I to go to the same school, and he yelled at me because he said that he was joking and that it was my fault for not understanding that he was joking. Our fights were never really fights, it was more so a one-sided conversation where it was like he was spanking me, but with his words. And last year, we probably had one of the worst fights because I was having trouble keeping my part of the house clean. After he was done yelling at me, I just stood there for a second thinking of what to say, but I didn’t wanna say yes, sir, but I also knew that I couldn’t say what I wanted to say, so I just gave a nod. After that, I went to my girlfriend’s house and out of spite, I decided to turn off my location to keep myself as detached for my dad as possible. And I had actually contemplated staying the night to get away from him. But I ended up going home because I knew that I couldn’t stay with my girlfriend at the time. I got home late and my phone had died since it was really old phone with a broken charge port. And Dad had thought that I had done something wrong and that I was ignoring his calls. When I told him that my phone had died, he said that he didn’t believe me and I showed him my dead phone. On the next day, we got into another really big fight where it was following a letter that I gave Dad that basically detailed how I was not still over the traumatic experience over my mom being unfaithful, and that I feel less fortunate because other people seem to be able to Live their life to the fullest whereas I have to work for everything to just barely get by and then I also made the complaint that God is seemingly absence of my suffering. When he read the letter, he honestly ignored my feelings and said that it was my fault because I lacked direction in my life. And after that massive fight, I just kind of kept to myself and decided to keep my emotions to myself and try to make nice with Dad and everything but I did. Fast-forward a couple of months, I get a phone call from my leadership saying that I have to go to Europe for active duty. And I’m currently in Europe now. Before then, I went on a vacation with John and Nancy and for once I felt free to do whatever I wanted and say whatever I wanted, so I decided to talk about my issues with mom and dad. And it turned out that PJ also had issues and that’s my sister also had issues and that really everybody had issues with my parents. When John and Nancy decided to move in together, mom and dad tried to spin the narrative that Nancy had corrupted John. But when John had talked to Mom, Mom had decided to see the truth for what Dad has been doing. And that Dad has actually been more controlling Mom and how he has been controlling some of the finances. With this in mind, I had already left home, but Bob and Mom decided to leave Dad and Dad decided to panic and tried to get in touch with everybody and I was reluctant to talk to him at first, but I had called him before going to Europe, and I called him out on everything that he did from how he raised me to be a people pleaser and how he threatened to kick me out of the house And as it turns out he made that threat without consulting Mom first. And since that I have not spoken to him and honestly, I don’t plan on it.

Months have passed since then, and John and Nancy have made peace with dad, but Bob has told me that Dad has not changed. And at this point, mom and dad are getting a divorce and that I’m still not planning to talk to my dad right now. Although not a day goes by where I have not thought of Regretting my decision to cut my dad off. But I’m sticking to it for now. There were also times where John and I would talk about Dad and he would try to convince me to try to give Dad a chance but I’m remaining firm and even making the claim that life is better without my dad since I’ve been in Europe. Although John has threatened to limit contact because at this point, he is happily married and says that he does not wish to allow the negativity to get to him. While I understand this, he also made the claim that I haven’t done anything to improve myself, which I actually took offense to because during my time in Europe, I’ve been slowly progressing myself in my health physically and mentally. And I’ve also been into therapy as well so John telling me that I’ve been doing nothing to make the situation better really made me angry to the point where I actually thought about not talking to him and cutting him off as well. For a moment, I actually thought about listening to him but when I reached out to Bob, he tells me that Dad has been putting up a front and that dad has been trying to make nice with him, but he thinks that it’s all fake. From using money in Easter egg hunts, which we never did previously. As well as seemingly taking an interest in some of the things that we weren’t allowed to watch as children such as Harry Potter. So right now I’m a bit of a crossroads because I’m going home in four months and in a perfect world, I would love to stay in Europe, but unfortunately, it’s not that simple.

I still want to try to have a relationship with my father, but I’m trying to decide whether or not a relationship with him is even possible. Lest I risk ruining my mental health again and I’m back to where I started. And the worst thing about Dad is that as many fights and arguments since we’ve had, the one thing that he did is lie about Jesus. He lied about the gospel and tried to make it more about legalism and adult children being subservient to their parents. He used Jesus’s name to push his own narrative and agenda. And because of that, I’m still recovering from dad’s wounds and I’m having a hard time going back to church. I want to continue to love Jesus and serve him, but I’m having a struggle because of having to purge dad’s false teachings. My mother and I are on good terms. But at the same time, I also can’t help. I feel detached from the rest of my family since I have been living the best life in Europe and I’ve been able to be my own person, capable of making my own decisions. Which is ultimately what I’ve wanted since all of this has come to light. I’m not really sure what to do from here, but I could use some advice or if nothing else some encouragement. I also want to know if I am truly wrong for not talking to my dad still and that I should give him a chance.

1kdn4ef,Should I reach out to my dad?,External_Cookie_1094,"Should I reach out to my dad after 5 years of silence?

My dad and I haven’t spoken in five years. My parents were never really together—more like friends—and he lived in another state when I was little. I’d visit sometimes, and he’d visit me and it felt ok ❤️

When I was 13, he started a new family and moved to my hometown. Which still boggles my mind. Because we became more distant than ever.

I went to their house about once a week, but I was never treated like the other siblings—no trips, no photos of me in the house, not on the Christmas cards.

Around 18, I noticed he had a tattoo of all the kids’ names... except mine. I never said anything - too scared to stir up what little connection I had with him.

Everything always went through my stepmom. My dad was always a little MIA. Step mom was kind but never fully included me. I always wanted to please her etc.

About five years ago, I finally gave up after years of it just being me to reach out. I realized that no one ever called me… it hurt.

I’d run into them, text them—mostly my stepmom and my sisters—but they all eventually stopped replying. I clicked to have them unfollow me on Instagram because it was too painful to see them engaging with my posts but never actually speaking to me. I feel like they probably think I’m dramatic now but I couldn’t handle it.

I feel like it was some mean girls stuff going on :/ I stopped reaching out after I sent a really nice Mother’s Day note to my step mom with no response… I thought someone might eventually check in but they never did. Now it’s been 5 years.

My seems like a great dad to the other kids but who knows? And I don’t really know him anymore- or ever did. But It still hurts. I want to be over it, but I’m not.

Reaching out feels like betraying myself—but the hole he left in my heart is still there. I’m just really sad and I can’t stop thinking about it.

Has anyone gone through this? Did reaching out bring closure—or just more pain?",1,0,1746256464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kdn4ef/should_i_reach_out_to_my_dad/

1kdj0n3,i’m beginning to resent my family and i’m not sure what to do,fudgeurm0m,"serious trigger warning, i talk about suicide a lot in this. sorry, but it’s the reality i guess 😭

throwaway account because (while i don’t believe anyone i know actively uses reddit) i would really prefer this didn’t get back to me in any way. so, i (19F) have struggled with mental illness my entire adolescence. i’m autistic, but was only recently diagnosed so i’m still figuring out which behaviours of mine, current and from childhood, are linked to that and what aren’t. what i do know is that as a result of my autism and my fathers passing when i was little, struggled with severe anxiety my entire life, social and otherwise. this was detrimental to my ability to make friends growing up, and when i did, i fell into a pretty toxic group of kids (relevant, i promise) which led to me self-harming, among other things. 

i was in therapy for a year or two after this was discovered by my mom (40F), but that was stopped after an altercation with mine and my brothers joint therapist, who completely disregarded my moms insistence for us to do bereavement counselling to work through our fathers death. i started going to counselling again after my mum got sick, a disorder like schizophrenia was the diagnosis. this service is provided to those under eighteen, so i think it’s important to say i’m currently not receiving any mental health support. 

my mom developed it a few years ago, i was sixteen and it was pretty much like our world imploded, as our mom was our only non-estranged family. my brother and i, (14) at the time of this, went to live with our uncle, pretty much against our wishes. i love my uncle, but mental health is a vicious thing in our family and, despite having lost two family members to suicide, it’s not treated how it should be. anyway, my mom was hospitalised and for a while she got better. this year, she got sick again. it’s been five months and she is in a consistent episode. she hates my guts, thinks my brother isn’t real, etc. 

over the time my mom was in hospital, my room got gradually messier and messier. i admit, its disgusting now. not uninhabitable, but it needs to be cleaned. theres clothes everywhere, definitely some food packages laying about, and none of my belongings are organised. it should not have got this way, but with everything i was dealing with family wise, on top on my own mental health and having serious depressive episodes and multiple relapses, it just became the lowest priority. 

when my mom got back out, she became increasingly hostile towards me. its important to say she was not and is not currently taking medication, because my moms mental health team is beyond useless. the days leading up to the event that blew up my life ??, my mom made several comments about me looking like my dad. i know in my soul this is what broke the camels back. she kicked me out on her birthday. her reasoning? my room. 

again, my mom is sick. like hallucinating kind of sick. while i am the first person to say that my room is a problem i need to deal with, it is not cause to kick me out other (nor is that reasonable? like i cant clean it if i’m not allowed inside?)

my family don’t really seem to gaf? like i know that they care, but i’ve pretty much been left out to dry here. i’m staying with my uncle, which is fine. but with me included, it’s a family of five in a two bedroom flat with two cats, one of which is extremely sick. i know my family love me, and i love them. they just suck at supporting each other. majority of my family live out of state, so this is literally the only place i have to go (bar my boyfriends house, which is not an option for more than one or two nights a week). i’ve tried to ask for support, and it kind of feels like i get brushed off every single time… 

they first suggested (rather demandingly) that i just clean the room, that i’m an adult and i “shouldn’t make excuses” when i tried to explain to them my own struggles with depression at that time. now, we talk about it more, but it either comes down to “you just have to clean your room” or “it’ll sort itself out” which it wont.

my mom needs medication. she has a disorder. she is sick. if she had cancer, nobody would be telling her that she doesnt need chemotherapy. but because my mom has a psychological disorder, its okay that she refuses to take the pills that could stop her from potentially hurting herself?

as of this month, my mom and i are no contact. she’s hurled so much abuse at me, stuff about my likeness dad that i just cannot deal with (he wasn’t a great guy), etc. and i have nobody but my boyfriend to talk to about it. i’m grateful for him obviously, he’s literally the reason i’m able to deal with this, but i wish my family were more understanding. we’ve lost two people in our family to suicide (including our dad) and i’ve dealt with stuff like that my entire life, but because i’m not dead, it isn’t serious enough. 

i want to say that my mom is not at fault for this. psychosis isn’t something that can be managed without medication, and my mom is simply dealing with the fallout of a life long battle with trauma she didn’t even really know she had. what i’m angry about is the fact i have no support. i literally spent every single day doing everything i could to help her, and yet i’m immediately in the wrong in my families eyes? the people who literally will not even text her. 

ive dealt with multiple relapses, a near suicide attempt, multiple physical health scares, all while going through my first year of uni. this has set me back so far behind in my schooling that i’m terrified i wont make it back next year, on top of the fact i have nowhere to actually live. i have a part-time job, but cant financially support myself enough to live alone, especially not with no outside support. student accommodation isn’t an option for this summer either, so the only options i have are for my mom to miraculously get better, or to wait until September to get into accommodation.

and it’s still not over, my moms been out of hospital for over two months now and is still insanely sick. my brother has called ambulances multiple times now, i’ve had to leave work to help him deal with it, but they wont take her back to hospital because every time she refuses to speak to them. she’s made several comments about suicide, which terrifies myself and my brother, having already lost our dad to suicide. i’m also financially supporting my brother for the most part, because sometimes my mom will refuse to pay bills because “they’re being punished” or because “they’re not playing along”.

i know i’m an adult now and that some of this stuff was definitely avoidable, but hindsight is 20/20 and at the end of the day, i’m just a girl who misses her mom. i can’t talk to these people, i can’t cry around them, i am being gaslit into believing that “this is life” and “life is hard” but this could all be stopped if someone would talk to my mom, at least make an attempt to get through to her, try and contact her mental health team, etc. this is not life, this is what they’ve decided my life should be and it sucks. hard.

on top of that (i missed a lot of uni days helping my mom or taking mental health days so i didn’t crash out in the middle of a lecture) i get off handed comments about my intelligence and my attendance all the time. i tried to comfort my cousin because she did bad in a test but did better than the rest of her class, and her sister snapped at me and said “i wouldn’t take advice from you about schooling”

i literally. passed. all. of. my. exams. 
one of the highest in my grade WHILE my mom was sick and i literally thought she was dead cause she went mia for days, WHILE having serious autistic burn out and being unable to get out of bed most days because i was so severely depressed.

1kdhjy4,Coming to terms with serial divorcee mother,armorfreakantiqueads,"
Hey guys I recently had somewhat of a revelation that I’d like your input on. For some background I’m a 27M who was raised by a single mother after a bitter separation from my dad. There was abuse and cheating from my dad’s part and he was overall kind of scummy, dealt drugs and beat my mom. Despite this, my mom had me and my older brother with him and they were together until I turned 3. So this is where some resentment towards my mom comes in. Being a single mother meant she had to work a ton to support herself and us and there was never anytime to spend with us which sucked considering our dad was out of the picture(jail). So when she decided to remarry and have another kid when I was like 6-7 it felt like a slap in the face because it felt like I was being pushed to the side for this new family she wanted even though she barely had time to give us any attention. It always confused me as to why she would do this and then complain constantly about never having time to do anything(despite it being her decision to start another family) and it created this really strange high stress environment at home that made life absolutely fucking miserable. Like clockwork, stepdad ended up cheating(tbh I don’t blame him, my mom is kind of a frigid, tense high stress work hard type A person who has no chill and I don’t know anyone who would tolerate her) a few years into the marriage, she got divorced again and AGAIN decided to remarry and have another kid within less than a year of meeting someone else a few years later. I was entering high school at this point. I remember telling her, don’t you think you’re moving a little too fast? She said, “we’re grown, we know what we’re doing” She was around 40 at this point. Well it was more of the same shit. Constant fights and arguments. High stress fraught marriage. She admitted to me that she regrets getting married to him. this really fucked me up and made me just hate my life and feel worthless. Of course I never really understood my emotions then or how to articulate them. Despite this I was a really high achieving kid in school and went off to college on scholarship but ended up dropping out after having anxiety and panic attacks which ended consuming a greater part of my 20’s which stemmed from me thinking I completely fucked up my life. I’m better now but upon reflection I think a lot of my anxiety came from thinking I had to follow “the path”. Go to school - get a good job to support a family - find a wife- get married- have kids and when I couldn’t have that I felt like a huge failure but I’ve recently begun to think I had it all backwards and my mom was the perfect example. I think her preoccupation with saving face in front of the family(our family is very traditional, divorce not allowed/ is a sin, no abortion, sex before/without marriage frowned upon) and not just being happy by herself has caused her a great deal of pain that she could have avoided if she wasn’t constantly chasing this perfect family. I always wished she would chill the fuck out but I now think that she was more concerned with what her family would think than what was best for us. And now, when I realized that I had those same preoccupations, I realized I could just chill the fuck out and let them go and live my life on my own terms and not what my family thinks of me and I feel like  a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. But I think, will I regret this? What if I don’t pursue building a life with someone else as aggressively now while I’m still young? Will I end up regretting it later when I’m old? Maybe my mom thought this also. What do you guys think?

1kdcse2,"Ends, Changes & Beginnings",OneGlassOne,"I was asked to post this for someone I know. Everything below this paragraph isn’t from me. Yes I read it, but don’t know the dude well enough to care and don’t know what to think of it anyway. Will show him any comments when I meet up with him.
—————

All names changed. Some places changed. I don’t need advice, but feel free to comment. The end of this story was 2 years ago, so I feel comfortable posting it now.

My name is Michael. I was born and grew up in the Midwestern United States, in the suburbs of a small town. I barely remember my parents. I know my mother was from Europe and married my father after meeting him on a holiday trip. The gist is that one day they were there…and the next day they were gone. Both snuffed out in a traffic accident when I was 10 years old. I was then taken in by my uncle Mark (my father’s brother), who lived nearby. It could have been the best thing that happened to me in a bad situation. But unfortunately I had to mess it up.

From the very first time I stepped into their home, I had apparently made it my mission to make them miserable. I am not going to make any excuses or offer half assed explanations. Maybe I was just hurt from the loss of my own parents, maybe I was just a little shit to begin with. Who knows? Doesn’t matter. I basically became the poster child of what it means to be an ungrateful brat with massive entitlement issues. My uncle Mark, his wife Mary and my cousin James (who was 3 years older than me), did everything they could to help me. I lacked for nothing and thanked them by being a constant thorn in their sides. I am not going to go into detail. I was a bully, I stole stuff and many other things. My cousin James became the main target of my ire and understandably started to resent me. I wish he had been more outspoken about it. I would have deserved a good scolding. But every time anyone tried to discipline me, I simply pulled out the good old ‚my parents passed in a traffic accident’ card. Worked every time, even though it shouldn’t. It all came to a close when he announced his engagement to his girlfriend Sarah. I should have been happy for him. Instead I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to annoy him one last time and pull out all the stops.

My plan was as childish as it was cruel. I spread a rumor about him having been unfaithful, making use of social media for my accusations to spread. It caused a massive rift in their relationship and their marriage was almost cancelled. Almost. The last straw came during the wedding. I was displeased that my original ‚plan‘ had not worked out and decided that I was owed compensation. The cash gifts from the wedding guests were the perfect target. I pocketed all of it and left the wedding. Having turned 18 recently and suddenly being in possession of close to $20k turned out to be as bad a combination as you would expect. I burned through it within about 10 days, while ghosting everyone as not to be disturbed while enjoying my ill gotten gains. I then came back home…and finally got what I deserved.

Disappearing from the wedding and the cash gifts going missing with me made it quite easy for everyone to figure out what happened. I wasn’t exactly the criminal mastermind I thought I was. I wasn’t in fact quite ignorant. During my time away, James had gone full detective mode. He not only had obtained proof that I had taken the money, but also managed to trace back the rumors I spread about him to the social media accounts created by me. He and the rest of the family confronted me upon my return and finally put their collective feet down. James insisted on pressing charges. I was arrested, interviewed and put in jail. No one in my family posted bail…and honestly…why would they. What happened afterwards is what you would expect. Criminal charges, civil litigation and more. I was given a court appointed lawyer who was surprisingly nice to me, despite me still having an attitude. After 6 months, my attorney had come to an understanding with James and his lawyer. I would promise to apologize to him in writing, admitting everything I had done and pay back the full amount I took, plus his legal expenses and all court fees. In exchange I would be spared jail. I accepted without hesitation, already starting to realize that I had hit rock bottom.

After being released I moved into the spare room of the only friend I had left. Carl had always been on good terms with me…probably because he felt a kinship due to having lost his own parents at a young age. He never enabled me, never put me down, never took any shit from me. He was just there. I was able to get a job in a warehouse (with some aid from the court), which would give me the possibility to start paying back what I owed. It was around this time that I finally became aware of my own behavior. The time I spent in jail and the legal process had already made a significant dent in my ego. The time I spent working and repaying James did the rest. A bit less than half a year before my 21st birthday I had made the last payment to James. I was rather proud of myself, mainly because I had managed to pay my dues in record time, by living like beggar. Carl had been a great support and even congratulated in a snarky way by commenting how proud I must be to have gotten back to zero.

I then decided that I could finally look to the future. Both professionally and socially. Both avenues would remain closed.

On the social side, I tried to genuinely reconnect with my Mark, Mary and James (as well as other family members), taking full responsibility for my actions. I wrote emails, sent messages and even wrote letters. It went nowhere. All three of them rebuffed my attempts, blocking me wherever possible and eventually threatening me with a restraining order. In a final, desperate attempt to show them that I was serious, I offered to leave them alone forever if they agreed to one last meeting. They agreed. We met in uncle Mark‘s home. I originally suggested a neutral place but they obviously wanted the home advantage. James‘ wife was there as well, but didn’t speak for the entire time. I started off by admitting to all my wrongdoings, explaining how I wanted to make amends and offering to submit to any conditions they had. I didn’t make excuses, didn’t deflect and didn’t deny that my choices were to blame for anything. It didn’t matter. They took turns laying into me, which I took without flinching, knowing that I had it coming. James unofficially concluded the meeting by explaining that he had decided to enforce his boundaries and preserve his peace, which necessitated him to cut all contact with me for his own well being. I couldn’t help but admire him for it (though it sounded rehearsed and more what you would hear from a trained therapist or self-help book). I knew it was the right thing to do and he didn’t owe me jack. Uncle Mark nodded in agreement and asked me to leave, reiterating that they weren’t my family anymore and never wanted to have anything to do with me. I had no choice but to accept. I stood up and stated that their decision was understandable and that they wouldn’t hear from me again. Then I apparently made a final mistake. Before leaving I said I wished them well and hoped they would have a happy life. For some reason this infuriated James (to this day I have no idea why it was that in particular). He charged at me and hit me in the face, shouting that I should finally shut up and just get lost. Uncle Mark pulled him off and while he was restraining James I made my exit. I made it a couple of feet away from their house before I heard a voice call my name. Uncle Mark had opened the door again and stared at me. ‚Don‘t ever come back. Do you understand?‘ I started stammering something, but he just repeated the final question louder and more furiously. ‚Do you understand?‘ I was finally able to stammer a faint ‚Yes‘. Uncle Mark then closed the door and I kept walking.

Professionally, it turned out just as bad. Small towns are exactly what you would expect them to be. Close knit and interconnected. Everyone is tied to everyone else. Be it through family ties, business contracts, church groups and similar. The warehouse job I had gotten was, unbeknownst to me, the only job I could have gotten to begin with. It was run by an old recluse who didn’t care about anyone and anything, perfectly inoculated from what the rest of the town said, did or thought. Unsurprisingly, it was impossible to find any other employment of make significant moves. No matter where I applied, the answer was always an immediate rejection. The closest I came was the office of an accountant at the very outskirts, who was actually willing to employ me, even offering to train me. I was exhilarated, already imagining a future where I could make a living as an accountant myself. I was also dumb enough to mention it in one of my rare interactions with people when grocery shopping. James wasted no time after learning about it and contacted the accountant’s office, raging about how employing me would backfire on them. The guy running the office told me how James had unloaded everything he thought and threatened to badmouth them everywhere if I was given the job. The offer of employment was rescinded shortly after. I still couldn’t get mad at anyone. I understood why they did it, but it didn’t change the fact that it left me with no choice but stay in a dead end job forever and live out my days as a hermit.

It was at this point that I decided to pull the plug. I had one last card up my sleeve and decided it was time to use it.

My mother, bless her heart, had never given up her foreign citizenship. And when I was born she had the good sense to go to a consulate and register my birth. This automatically gave me her citizenship as well, since the country she was from operated under ‚law of the blood‘. I was told this by my attorney during the aforementioned legal proceedings, after he decided to go through every shred of documentation there was about me. I took some days off and made my way to the nearest consulate, applying for a new passport. It arrived after 2 weeks. Nobody knew about this. Not uncle Mark, not James, nobody. I didn’t even tell Carl. And this wasn’t the only good news. My foreign passport listed me with my mother’s family name (I think this was some sort of clerical error but I didn’t complain), essentially giving me something close to a completely new identity. The country my mother was from was now my way out. I had nothing left here. My own choices had made sure I had no options, no future and no life. Furthermore, the country of my mother offered an interesting way for me to integrate and take my first steps at no cost. I had read up on the country. All male citizens are required to do mandatory military service, during which one is provided with insurance, food and shelter while getting paid a regular salary. It was a perfect way out. All I would have to do is get there, report for recruitment as any other citizen living in the country and would get a new start.

I stayed with the warehouse job until I had saved up around $6000, which was enough to buy a plane ticket and survive for some time. When I was ready, I quit my job at the warehouse, sold all my remaining belongings and shut down all my social media accounts. I destroyed any and all documents I could get my hands on, unless I needed to take them with me. The proceeds from selling my stuff went to Carl. He tried to refuse, stating that I had paid for rent and groceries while staying there. But I insisted. In the end he accepted and we went out for dinner together one last time. I pondered whether I should tell him where I was going, but decided against it. Carl didn’t ask and I took that as silent acknowledgement that we wouldn’t see each other again. I took a bus to the nearest available airport and bought the cheapest one-way ticket I could find to my mother’s homeland. One day later I stepped off the plane in Western Europe. In a new country, with no past and a clean slate, where nobody knew anything about me.

The next couple of months were an administrative nightmare, but nothing I couldn’t handle. I was focused on building a new life and a new me. This time with the right attitude. After getting settled with the help of some social service providers, I reported to the military. I had started to learn the local language, which came surprisingly easy to me (I assume I had retained some of it from my mom, imagining how she might have spoken it to me when I was little), but it wasn’t enough to get one of the more coveted jobs in the military. I was drafted as a regular infantryman and shortly after reported for basic. What followed was the most memorable and uplifting time I had until then. I gained language proficiency, made new friends and even had enough time to cram for some national exams. Turns out I wasn’t stupid and eventually even able to gain entrance into a university. The military was surprisingly understanding of personal issues and the instructors and superiors would give leave and time to study, as long as you did you job. My new life took form and my former life slowly faded away. My surroundings felt less and less alien, until one day everything simply felt…normal. With my past slowly being lifted off of me, I started to look back at my former self in a more objective manner. I was better able to understand why uncle Mark and his family did what they obviously had to. They were right to cut me out. They were right to enforce their boundaries. And as it turns out, they weren’t the only ones who profited from it. Not only had they secured their own peace, but had also given me the opportunity to move on without the need to look back. Shortly before the end of my mandatory service, I struggled with the idea of writing them and letting them know that I was all right. But I eventually decided against it. A clean cut had been made and if I wanted their lives to remain untainted and my new life to remain unburdened I needed to accept that this new me was separate from the old me.

After leaving the military I went straight into my studies, aided by the money I had saved up during my service. After finishing my degree at the age of 26, I found work through one of my old army buddies. He had gone into government service and was looking for new employees. I joined his office as a regular worker and managed to climb my way up to project supervisor in a bit more than 2 years. The salaries here are much higher than in the US and the benefits are great. At the age of 30 I was well established and had good savings. I decided to cut the final tangible cord at this time and renounced my US citizenship. I did it mainly for emotional reasons, but it turned out to make my financials a lot easier to manage as well. The first two decades of my life felt like the memories of a different person at this point. My past had become history, history had become a myth. And that myth was now well hidden behind the fog of time. I was finally living. Going out, having fun, exploring my hobbies. True satisfaction had finally set in. And that’s when the universe decided to throw me one final curveball.

As mentioned, I had shut down all accounts that had anything to do with my past life and name. Facebook, Twitter, email, etc. All gone. And after gaining a foothold in my new country, I decided to stay off. There were no pictures of me anywhere. No accounts. What little I had was under my new name, boiling down to a work email and two private emails. I was still slightly on edge and wanted to make sure that no one could ever connect me to the person I once was. The one exception was one of my first and since then rarely used email accounts, which I simply hadn’t bothered to close. That account had stayed silent for over a decade (not counting the occasional spam or provider notifications). Until it suddenly lit up with a message. It was from James. ‚We need to talk. Call me.‘

All my alarm bells went off immediately. I had no intention of letting my old life come back to haunt me and disturb what I had built. This meant maintaining a wall of separation between me and anyone who could come after me. Calling James was thus out of the question to begin with. It would reveal my phone number and my current country of abode, which was unacceptable. Instead I wrote back, stating that phone calls were absolutely out of the question and that he was free to write. One day afterwards I received an answer…and it was everything I was afraid of. James and his wife had two kids. One was a girl named Alice, who was now 8 years old. She was diagnosed with some sort of illness and was in need of a tissue donation (James included a lot of medical terms I did not understand). Tests had concluded that neither James, nor his wife or any other relative was able to donate. They now demanded that I get tested and donate, if I happened to be a match.

I didn’t even have to think about it. I wrote back that I was very sorry about their situation, but would be unable to help. I explained that they had rightfully cut me off years ago and how I had accepted their decision as a well deserved consequence of my past behavior. But now I had a different life which no longer had anything to do with them and thus had no intention of ever getting into contact in any way shape or form. I ended the email by wishing them all the best. Naturally, this was too much to ask. What followed were furious emails from James and Mark, calling me every name in the book, insisting that I had a moral obligation to help them. They pointed out how this would be the golden opportunity for me to actually show my remorse and willingness to make up for my actions, as I had originally offered during the last meeting we had at Mark‘s house.

It didn’t faze me. I responded by reminding them that my offer had been refused at the time I made it. I reiterated that James, Mark and the other family members had been well within their rights to enforce their boundaries and equally justified in deciding to get rid of someone as toxic as me. I even admitted that I had been and still was supportive of their decision back then. But at the same time this meant that the division between me and them had been final and irreversible. All parties involved, which necessarily had to include me, were given a fresh start and a new beginning. Accordingly, by paying back what I was owed in monetary terms and walking away when commanded to do so, I had been released from any remaining real or metaphysical debt. Something they had implicitly agreed to, even if they hadn’t realized it at the time. I ended by reminding Mark that he specifically told me never to come back and repeating that I considered my old life to be over and having no intention of poisoning my new reality by reconnecting with anyone or anything from back then. I again expressed my regret over their situation and kindly asked them to leave me alone. Again, they seemed to completely miss the point.

For the next week my old email account was flooded. This time not only by James and Mark. Mary and even James‘ wife were chiming in, with occasional emails from others I didn’t know where to place. All messages were alternating between anger, guilt-tripping and outright commands for me to comply. I ignored them all, but didn’t shut the account down just yet (though I should have done after responding to the first email). Their outbursts might have worked on the old me. But that wasn’t the person they were writing to. Instead I started to block people one by one, after sending each  of them a final message saying ‚I will not be spoken to in this tone of voice.‘ Eventually only James and Mark were left, with me honestly thinking we could simply part as equals with no hard feelings. Unfortunately they had different plans. I reached my limit when they started demanding that I tell them where I live, to hand over a phone number so they can call me and insisting on a face to face meeting. I am not going to lie. This scared the hell out of me. If they were this unreasonable and insistent with one email account at their disposal, there was no way to tell what they would do if they were given more avenues to get to me. My current social and professional circle, my whole life, was completely separated from my past. And I knew I had to make sure it stayed that way. I sent out a final email to Mark and James simultaneously. I reiterated that I had no intention of violating the boundaries they themselves had set up. Not just for them, but for all our sakes. I again expressed my sorrow about their situation and wished them all the best for the future, ending in another plea to leave me alone and pursue other avenues to remedy their problem. I then deleted the email account.
After that I decided to make sure that I was safe. I started to monitor their online activities. Luckily, their profiles were all public, which made it easier to get ahead of anything they might come up with. I was relieved when it became clear that no actions on my part would be necessary. They had started to post about how they needed to find me, how it was a matter of survibal, tagging everyone they could think of. Anything would apparently be helpful to them. They wanted information on where I worked, where I lived, who my friends were. They posted old photos of me, asking for them to be circulated. But the nature of their posts and the way they tagged people and organizations showed that they were operating under extremely misguided assumptions. They were obviously under the impression that I was still close by. Really close by. As in the same county or state. They hadn’t the slightest idea that we were separated by an ocean. That I wasn’t even a citizen of the US anymore. Or that I had a completely new family name.

Their profiles furthermore contained links to a donation site, asking for money to keep up with expenses during Alice‘s treatment. They also asked for people to get tested voluntarily, hoping to find a donor match. It was good to see that at least some of their efforts were going towards a productive use of social media, instead of incessantly focusing on me. A look at the donation site showed that it was going well and I even decided to make a somewhat significant contribution myself. Though I made it through a colleague under the pretense that I didn’t know how to use the site, paying him back through a bank transfer.

I kept watching for 2 months, just to make sure I didn’t miss anything. I know this shouldn’t be something to laugh at, but sometimes I had to chuckle. Nutjobs were commenting on how they had seen me in various places in my old home town, the state and even other places in the US. Some offering to follow me if they came across me again (these people are seriously deranged). They once zoned in on a homeless shelter in a neighboring town, where some poor guy had apparently somewhat similar features to me. Based on what I could dig up online, they actually drove there, made a fuss and scared the living daylights out of the dude by pressuring him to prove that he wasn’t me. Police got involved and they only backed off after it became clear that they had harassed some random sap. The comments sometimes got quite sinister. Allegedly retired police officers gave tips on how to lure me out by reporting me missing, filing random criminal charges against me and similar shenanigans. There were even shady looking private investigators offering to find me for the right price. It was a relief to see that their best ideas wouldn’t have a snowball‘s chance in hell of even getting close to me. I did feel sorry Alice, but reminded myself that it wasn’t within my power to do anything. That might have fallen within the responsibility of the person I once was. But that person had ceased to exist a long time ago. And honestly…that is a good thing. After being satisfied that I was safe, I closed down the account I had used to monitor them as well, which felt like putting an end to this unwelcome visit from the past once and for all.

The only possible loose end was that I had renounced my US citizenship in the country I lived in now, meaning that the US consulate technically knew my new name and citizenship. I know I was probably being paranoid, but I called the US consulate nevertheless and asked some questions that wouldn’t raise suspicion. After the call I knew that this avenue of investigation would be a dead end as well…assuming they even got that far. Everything was thus in order.

Over half a year has passed since then and I am at peace. I don’t know what happened to James or Alice and I doubt I ever will. There is no need for a stranger to know about the lives of other strangers. I have my job. I have my friends. I have my life. And most of all, I have my own boundaries which I will not allow to be breached. As strange as it sounds, I will always be grateful to uncle Mark and his family for setting those borders up when I didn’t even knew I needed them myself. They ensured not only their own peace but also secured my own future in the process. By forcing me to face my own shortcomings without their enabling, they set me on a new path. A path I didn’t mess up like the last one. Mark, Mary and especially James certainly didn’t deserve what I did to them. They were thus right to make me pay for my transgressions. They were justified in cutting ties. It is fully understandable that they doubted my sincerity to make up for my mistakes and finally change. I would have doubted myself back then as well. Anyone would have. Instead they were kind enough to demand a very small price. Full separation. I paid it…and did so gladly. Which is why I can now move forward without the need to look back.

I am now 32 years old. My birthday was a couple of weeks ago. I celebrated with my girlfriend Nina (I met her at work. She is 28, a data entry specialist and into sci-fi as much as I am), friends from the office, old army buddies and other people I met during my time here. People who only know the me I am now. I rented out a rooftop venue, which was quickly filled with laughter, music and conversation. During the evening my former CO came over and complimented me on something strange. Said he remembered how bad my [local language] was when he met me during basic. But now, he wouldn’t be able to tell me from a native speaker. For some weird reason that stuck with me. It was as if I had managed to overcome some final hurdle that completed a journey I wasn’t even aware I was on. After the celebrations had ended, me and my girlfriend got ready to return to our apartment. I stared back at the venue before walking into the staircase, prompting Nina to ask me whether I had forgotten something. I answered honestly. ‚Nope. Nothing important.‘

If anyone reads this. Just know that it is never too late to change. Never too late to start something new. I wish you all the best.",1,0,1746222416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kdcse2/ends_changes_beginnings/
1kdabnh,My brother is killing me mentally,Nosleep6O,"Me (16F) and my sister (18F) are home five days a week watching my baby sister while my parents work. They do team trucking and they are gone from 2am to about 10:30 at night (sometimes later or earlier) And my brother (16M) is home with us also, but here's the issue. He does nothing all day, he stays us all night playing his game and on his phone and TV until the morning then sleeps. My sister takes care of my sister while I do most of the housework (cooking meals, cleaning, laundry, etc) and I don't really mind doing what I do, it keeps me busy and such but can also be stressful and overwhelming, so when I ask my brother to come do the dishes or help me fold laundry, he ignores me, usually calls me names regarding my weight or some kind of slur but he does eventually do what I ask him to do but he doesn't do it right, he leaves pots and pans in the sink or does other things that just make my job harder instead of easier. He's incredibly disrespectful to me to and shows no appreciation to me, I cook his meals, clean his house and make sure he lives good. And i dont need him to tell me he appreciations me, but it feels like he doesn't care at all and that upsets me alot. So today he came downstairs to make food, I said ""while your waiting for your food, can you help me with the laundry?"" (I had washed and dryed about three loads of my parents clothes this morning and had i bunch to fold for them so they could relax this weekend) and he said no and that it's my job as a woman, I disagreed then he called me names like ""fatass and bitch"" then he went back upstairs. I just broke down crying, his words do really effect me and it's so upsetting getting put down by my own brother who i love and care for everyday. Every night I cry myself to sleep, I'm so tired of dealing with him everyday and its taking a toll on me. My confidence and self esteem is so low I'm always thinking how much I hate myself and my body, I'm barely eating and taking care of myself and i feel so worthless and unloved, im just so sick of everything he does and says.",6,3,1746216045.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kdabnh/my_brother_is_killing_me_mentally/
1kd62ci,My brother is a professionally trained psychological manipulator,breaditusers,"I’ve been dealing with a long-standing family conflict, and at this point, I’m afraid it might be a lost cause.

I (F, late 20s) have an older brother (early 30s) who has always been… problematic. Growing up, he mastered the art of instigating people, and as he got older, he pursued psychology and neuroscience. At one point, he was even a PhD candidate, but he never graduated.

I believe his major issues escalated in 2020 when he threatened a woman on Twitter. She exposed him to his school, professors, and colleagues, and others came forward with allegations of verbal and physical threats, destruction of property, assault, and even stalking. It’s unclear if he’s been in school since then, though he’s repeatedly told me and my dad that he has—constantly moving the goalpost on his supposed graduation date for the past five years.
A few months after the Twitter incident, he lost his apartment and moved back in with our dad (60) at our childhood home. Within weeks, he started having frightening arguments with our dad, blaming him for his failures, making threats, and damaging property—breaking doors, punching walls, throwing things. Sometimes, in the middle of these blowups, he’d call me (despite me living five hours away by car) and find a way to blame me for whatever had set him off that day.

Then, three months in, things escalated. My brother texted my dad, threatening to kill him. Right after, he called me to “apologize for what he was about to do.” I immediately hung up and called my dad, who seemed unfazed—until my brother started kicking down his door. That’s when I called the police. They removed him from the house and warned that if he returned, he’d be charged with trespassing.
That’s when the guilt trips began. He’d text us saying he was staying at a homeless shelter and had witnessed something horrific. He’d bring up our mom (who passed from cancer in 2007), saying she’d be “rolling in her grave” over how we treated him. He dug into my past, throwing painful memories in my face, even telling me to end my own life—that the people I love would be better off without me. (Thank God I had already done the work on myself, because if I’d heard that 10 years ago, I don’t know if I would have made it.)
About a month later, my dad caved and let him move back in. And so, the cycle repeated. Over the past four years, he has continued his destructive behavior. He has verbally attacked my boyfriend (who I plan to marry) with racist remarks. He twists anything personal I’ve ever shared with him into a weapon.

On top of all this, my brother hasn’t worked in years. He’s fully able-bodied but has been unable to hold down a job and is living on welfare. Yet, instead of using that as an opportunity to get his life together, he continues to be a toxic force in our home.

What makes this even more ironic is that my brother has always been an advocate for mental health and is highly educated in addiction. He frequently talks about the dangers of substance abuse—yet he has recreationally used marijuana for years and has dabbled in mushrooms and other substances.

In May 2024, my boyfriend (of 4 years) and I visited my dad for his 60th birthday. My brother gave us the silent treatment, but otherwise, we had a great trip. When I visited again in November, things seemed better. My brother and I actually had a decent conversation—until, out of nowhere, he casually offered me hard drugs. I brushed it off and went to bed.

The next day, things took a dark turn. While getting ready for a friend’s birthday dinner, I gave my dad a few marijuana edibles to try (they’re legal where we are). That’s when my brother flipped. He accused me of trying to kill our father. I tried to reason with him, but he began berating me, screaming that I was “a f-ing woke tranny piece of shit.” (For the record, I’m a cis woman, but that’s beside the point.) He then told me to “get the f out of his house.”
At that moment, I no longer felt safe. I decided to grab my things, go to dinner, and find somewhere else to stay for the night. As I was leaving, he grabbed my hair, yanked me to the floor, and we struggled. I managed to get up and call the police.
Here’s the kicker—while I was giving my statement, the officers felt the need to tell me how well-educated my brother is. As if his past studies in psychology and neuroscience somehow excused his violent behavior. No charges were filed because there were no witnesses and no serious bodily harm. That night, he sent me a barrage of vile texts. I blocked him. And I told myself: Enough.
I thought cutting him off would bring relief. It didn’t.
The real issue is my dad. He can’t bring himself to cut my brother off. I understand—no parent wants to see their child on the streets—but things cannot continue like this. It’s been six months since I last saw or spoke to my brother, and unless he makes serious changes and acknowledges the harm he’s caused, I want nothing to do with him.

Recently, my dad confided in me about what’s been happening. My brother has been stealing—marijuana, alcohol, prescription meds—anything with street value. I’m terrified for my dad. It feels like I’m watching a slow-motion horror movie, except it’s my life.",1,0,1746205307.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kd62ci/my_brother_is_a_professionally_trained/

The problem is: my father has always been difficult, especially when drunk — and I’m scared of what will happen if I leave him alone.

My parents are separated. My mom left after my dad humiliated her during a drinking session and hit her on the head with a helmet. But I later found out my mom has also reconnected with an ex — someone who already has his own family. They’re neighbors now where she lives, which makes it all the more painful for me to process.

On my father’s side, things are tense with our neighbors (who are relatives). During the pandemic, my drunk dad had a violent encounter with them. He threatened them with a shovel, hurt my aunt (who was trying to stop him), and my cousin retaliated. Ever since, the tension never died down. Their dog bit my younger brother. Our cats messed with their food. They got mad. We got mad. My mom even once stormed over to confront them.

A while ago, my father got jailed after supposedly threatening my aunt again during another drinking session. One of our cousins — an SK official — used her connection with the barangay to call for immediate action. No blotter, just an invite while he was drunk. He ended up cursing, throwing things, and getting arrested. Some say he deserved it. But I still feel it was handled with bias and possibly some abuse of power. Even the barangay officials — who knew my father personally — looked conflicted.

Now I work night shifts, and I’m scared to leave the house unattended. I don’t want to be the only one who’s constantly stepping in to de-escalate things — but I’m also scared of what might happen to my father if I’m gone. If he gets provoked and lashes out, he could get hurt or hurt others. But I’m also drowning in responsibilities. I’m ₱44,000 in debt, paying the bills, and emotionally exhausted. I want to move out, find peace, and stop carrying everyone’s burden — but I’m afraid of what might happen if I do.

How do you choose between your peace and your responsibility? Am I wrong for wanting to leave, even if it means leaving my father behind?",2,3,1746192782.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kd129o/my_father_is_the_reason_our_family_is_broken_but/

up and working extremely hardly she got into an university but immediately
after graduating she got married dad and my dad didn't allow her to work.
she is a kind of person that always has been trying to be independent and so
strong. also my dad's family(his mom and sister specially) has been hurting
her a lot. it has been so hard for her until our family moved out to a separate

etc. and she was so tired of it finally she started to work at a school(she is
actually a teacher but she was doing technical work at school) honestly she
was getting much more tired but at least she was happy because of working
also I forgot to mention that mom was preparing to be/work as a teacher for
4 years, but since she is a litte old her score wasn't enough but she tries so
hard(sometimes because of that I get angry with dad because if he let her
work she wouldn't have to suffer this much for years) but after 2 years or a
new law implemented which made her to quit job(she had no chance) and
she started to give lessons at home so she is always at home both working
and doing housework and she is literally worn out, burnt out and it started to
affect her physically too, she started to see a doctor, lots of medicines but

She drinks and gets really mean, when she was in town last time she told me my relationship wouldn’t last and when I told her not to talk to me like that she pulled her phone out in the middle of the restaurant and started filming me and then paid for the meal without using my discount and proceeded to Venmo request me and my other sisters the next day. She also consistently texted my sister “b*itch” even though my sister didn’t reply.

Fast forward to current times, I am traveling to her city for work and asked if I could stay with her versus getting a hotel paid for by my company. She said yes and that’s been the plan. However, she wants to go to a couple bars before dinner and having a fire on Saturday, which I’m already nervous about because she gets mean when she drinks. Then she texted my sister today and told her to make plans with me because, and I quote, “I know you guys like to lay around on Sunday’s and I don’t want that at my house”. To preface, she never asks about me or my hobbies and we literally never talk u less she needs something. I don’t lay around on Sunday’s.

So instead of her asking me to join her plans she pawns me off. I now want to say my company ended up getting me a hotel closer to my work location for Monday and just avoid her as much as I can but my dad says I’ll be making it into something bigger.

What do you all think?

1kc8ser,Should I stop contacting my grandpa? Should I tell my family? What should I do?,Fun_Tea636,"I don't know how to explain this, especially when I don't think anyone else in my family knows this. 

For background info, my dad and aunt has been in a family feud with their parents, whom I refer to as grandpa and grandma, and this feud started way before I was born. It started when my grandpa was gossiping to my grandma about my aunt, but he was also gossiping about my grandma to my aunt (kinda confusing, ik) , leading to my aunt and my grandma to have this really massive fight, where my grandma ended up cutting my aunt out her trust fund and inheritance, burning my aunt's clothes and stuff, and even threw the rest of my aunt's clothes out the window. This caused my whole family to take sides, with my grandma and grandpa on one side, and my aunt and dad on the other side. From my dad and aunt's interpretation, my grandpa was the mastermind behind it and used my grandma as a shield to make him seem like the victim, as my grandpa claimed that he ""didn't do anything wrong"" after this incident, and my grandma as an enabler.  

My grandpa and grandma wasn't really good parents to my dad and aunt. My grandpa was an absent father who constantly cheats on my grandma, and conducts affairs by claiming that he has ""business meetings"". My grandma was pretty abusive towards my dad and aunt, often beating them up for tiny mistakes, basically they would walk around eggshells every time she get back home from school. I am actually quite surprised on how my dad and aunt turned out, being relatively normal people with great achievements in life and starting their own family.

My grandpa was also apparently a big fat bitch towards my mom during the early years of my mom and dad's marriage. When my parents first got married, my grandma was nice to her and welcomed her to the family. Meanwhile, my grandpa viewed my mom as not suitable as a wife to his ""precious only son"". This was because my dad's side of the family is filled with wealthy and scholarly people, they're the typical ""doctor, lawyer, businessman, engineer"" career and expectations. Which is why they made my dad go to the best school in the city, sent him abroad to study, graduated from a top private university, and got a high-paid corporate job. My mom was the complete opposite from that, she went to art school and didn't graduate from university, as well as coming from a low-middle class family from a small city. However, my mom is actually more impressive than what my grandpa thought, she migrated to Canada at 19 and learnt english, while also being a model that represented her hometown and worked at a desk job.  Anyways, my mom said how my grandpa mistreated her very badly, often picking at her style, the way she cleans, the way she puts makeup, how her cooking isn't up to par and thought she was the stereotypical dumb pretty woman that is using my dad's money. He nitpicked her whenever he could, and made her eat food scraps (food that she cooked for him btw!!!!). My grandpa would create lies about my mom about how she is talking behind my dad's back, which leads to my mom and dad frequently arguing. That was, until my dad found out it was my grandpa who created those lies and stopped listening to my grandpa. My grandpa only became nice to my mom after I was born, because I was their ""first grandchild"". 

When I was young, I didn't understood why my aunt and dad would often get into conflicts with my grandparents. And I often viewed my aunt and dad as ""petty children"", until I turned 10 when my dad told me and my sister about the feud. I tried to be nice to my grandparents as I don't want to be seen as a disrespectful and ungrateful grandchild. But once I got older, I found it very difficult to maintain a conversation with my grandpa. He creates lies and lies about other people and his own family, mocking their success in life, while talking about his ironically failing business. Not to mention, he's somehow racist and sexist too. I dated a south east guy in the past and when he broke up with me, my grandpa told me how he didn't deserve me, not because he did me dirty, but because he was ""South east asian, and they're poor and dirty"" and proceeded to tell me how our race is the superior amongst all asians. When I got into university, he told me how I am a female so I don't have to work and study as hard? If that made total sense. 

A few weeks ago, my grandpa suddenly shoved my sister and I a bunch of money and told us to not tell our housemaid. Which I was highly confused, when I asked why, he replied ""You'll know once you're older."", but I kept asking and insisting he tells me now. He gave in and told me, claiming that our housemaid is trying to steal our money and she was going to meet up with him on monday to get money from him since she asked him for money. He told asked me to keep it a secret as he ""cares"" about our family, of course I tried to believe him at first, but I wanted to make sure myself. So on monday, I stayed home from school and kept a close eye on the housemaid. In the end, the housemaid stayed with me and inside the house the entire day, never once meeting up with my grandpa. Once again, I caught my grandpa creating stupid lies. 

I am actually pissed off and tired of my grandpa's bs. He created so much lies about everyone in the family, as well as dragging innocent people. However, I'm going to college soon and it's across the globe, so I won't be seeing my grandpa as much these next 4 years. My grandpa keeps on calling me and asking if I could come visit him and I declined every time and claim that I am busy studying for my exams(It starts next week btw). I just don't want to see him after that stunt he pulled and expected me to believe it. 

I don't know what to do, I don't know if I should confront him about this, or tell my parents. ",2,2,1746106262.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kc8ser/should_i_stop_contacting_my_grandpa_should_i_tell/

I thought maybe years later things will change but it never does..he keeps annoying me and provoking me and play time becomes a whole fight that results someone getting injured.

1kc22vy,How do I deal with someone who is impossible to reason with? But can’t cut them off?,New_Girl567,"

So this is about my stepmom. I’m grown (33) and my dad married my stepmom when I was already an adult in my twenties. 


Basically long story short, I’ve been away in another state from my stepmom and now I’m back and dealing with her horrible communication skills. She’ll make comments that are hurtful, and today I asked about a comment she keeps making that has been hurtful to me. I started a conversation trying to figure out if there is a misunderstanding with the comments and basically she felt attacked and started a war, brought up something completely unrelated that i apparently recently did that upset her that I had no idea about, tried to gaslight me, and the whole thing turned into an unnecessary argument. This isn’t the first time she’s done this. She just has horrible conflict resolution skills and it doesn’t matter how patient I am, she takes off with these things and starts a war. She’s very committed to having the upper hand, never committed to solving the miscommunication or conflict. 

I ask myself why I even thought it would be worth it to bring up the comment knowing that she does this every time, and it’s because if I don’t bring it up, she’ll continue making the rude comments, and either way, silent or not, I end up feeling disrespected. 

I am at a point where i don’t feel like it’s a relationship that’s worth having anymore. I know it’s my stepmom, but I’ve already gone no contact with my own mom because she is abusive. I’m starting to notice a pattern with who my dad chooses as partners. she acts like my actual mom in many ways, just not quite as bad. 

Because of the abuse from my mom growing up, I’ve dealt with choosing partners/friends in my life that treated me poorly because I was familiar with that treatment. I’ve done a lot of work in breaking that cycle for myself and now I’m in a very loving marriage. I’m very careful nowadays with what kind of treatment I accept, and my gut tells me not to accept poor treatment from her anymore. She’s proven that she doesn’t want to improve in her way on communication and I’m unwilling to allow her to make rude comments to me, so I’m not sure how I can continue to even be around anyone like that, even if it’s my stepmom, I really don’t need another horrible mom in my life. 

The problem is, if I actually did go no contact with her, I think she would make it very hard to see my dad. I’m pregnant and my husband just joined the military so we will be moving very soon, and If I cut her off, visits are going to be very difficult with my dad. I’m at a loss on what to do moving forward with her. I also just don’t want my baby to grow up and having people like this in her life and seeing that kind of treatment and her watching me accept that treatment. I’m just not sure what to do.

1kc1o5z,Difficult Family Situation,eyesofkosmos4,"First time ever asking for advice. Some context: I grew up with unstable housing, parents who abused each other, and constant fighting. My siblings and I were there for each other during those tough times. I, the oldest, moved out first and started my adult life outside my hometown and state. Both siblings stayed and still live with one of our parents.

Fast forward to now, I have a great marriage, a home, and a career, all 45 minutes outside my hometown. I talk to my family regularly, but most of the conversations end with them complaining about their situation, needing money, and so on. I always listen and share advice, which they say is great, but they never follow it. So, I’m just repeating myself. I never give monetary support, which makes them angry and they try to make me feel guilty.

Almost 10 years ago, I moved closer to my hometown (where they all still live) and tried to set up holidays, hangouts, and other events with them. But they’ve always canceled last minute, claiming to be “sick,” not having money, gas, or anything else. I always feel like I’m trying to mend this gap, but I never receive anything in return. If I don’t reach out, drive to them, or call, I never hear or see them.

When there are problems, I always get the same responses: “I’m never here to support” or “I don’t understand.” I’ve grown up and realized how toxic our situation was growing up, but neither my siblings nor our parents want to admit or hear it. Always having the victim mentality.

I had a breaking point when the parent that both siblings live with has been having health issues and isn’t taking care of themselves. My siblings have asked for help and advice on what to do, and I’ve given them both. I’ve done everything I could, but it’s thrown in my face that I’m not doing enough. (Mind you, both siblings are in and out of jobs, always go to the bar, or have some issues with the law.)

I’m at the point where I don’t even feel like I’m family anymore to them. I just feel like a distant friend they call to when they need something. I feel awful at the thought of going no contact, but I don’t know what else to do. I’ve done everything I could. I’ve never once lost my temper or said anything I’d regret to them.

He declined to respect the boundaries set around my child so I cut contact. 

One of our parents never misses an opportunity to bring him up in conversation and for the nearly two years I‘ve held strong in no contact, it has not affected me. 

However recently I have been told about how he has been mistreated by our other parent. It is probably our trauma bond pulling me, but I am now really struggling with feelings of missing him and wanting to reach out to him. 

My partner who is very pragmatic would never support this and is very good at holding strong. It would take A LOT for them to ever consider allowing my brother to be in our lives again. 

I really feel stuck and lonely, and sorry for my brother as we have a shared understanding of this parent who has recently done him wrong again. 

He has never made any attempt to apologise or repair our relationship though.

1kblsrx,"Am I overreacting, or is my ab#s#ve mom and her weird obsession with my step-brother ruining my life?",Alarming-Cucumber387,"TW: s#lf-harm, emotional ab#se

Okay, so first, some background information about my (20,F) relationship with my mom. My dad d#ed of c#ncer when I was 9. I loved him a lot, and that affected me deeply. After dad d#ed, my mom didn’t really care about me, and things started to go bad. From the age of 11, she kept talking trash about my dad and how I’m exactly like him and am ruining her life, even though I was just a kid. How I looked like him, and how I’m going to suffer like him all alone. Constantly telling me she wishes she had an ab#rti#n.

Then, from time to time, she would go crazy over small things (like me falling asleep one day when I was too tired to do the dishes after school) and pretend to k#ll herself or run away because of me. Which I couldn’t process as a kid, so I used to constantly cry at home wanting to run away. I started to walk every night for hours to get away from her and tire myself out so I could fall asleep without crying. She barely gave money for food or cooked much and spent my college fund from my relatives.

The constant insults that I’m a burden, that nobody will ever like me, that I’ll d#e alone and I’m h#ll to put up with, and other stuff, messed me up as a kid, and I believed her for a long time. She constantly gaslit and manipulated me, and I believed I was insane. I used to be so scared to go home every day in case she lost her sh#t that day. Whenever I fell sick, she used to scream at me for being so useless and leave me alone to deal with myself. I stopped telling her I was sick. One day, I got my period too early and didn’t have pads. I used to have horrible cramps to the point where I used to throw up continuously. I asked her if she could buy some for me from a nearby store. She threw a tantrum and made me walk to the shop, bl##ding into my pants.

I used to have a packed bag in case I needed to run away. Whenever she did something nice for me, she used it to manipulate me into doing something for her. She used to constantly threaten me, saying that she would call everyone I know and spread lies about me so they would never talk to me again. But in front of everyone, she acted like the best mom ever, and people used to tell me how jealous they were about my relationship with my mom. To everyone, I was the top scorer with the perfect mom.

A while later when I was 15, she started to talk for hours late at night with men, then one day I found d##k pics on her phone from my dad’s married best friend. Later, I asked her about it, and she gaslit me, saying that this was what friends did to support each other. Then she broke up with him, saying that it was because of me, which made him mad at me. I was scared something would happen.

Then in high school, suddenly things were calm. I thought the worst was over. One day, I came out to her (as a l#sbi#n)  because she seemed understanding of the community. That shattered everything for good. Every day she yelled at me about how I’m a monster that ab#ses girls and I don’t deserve to live. That I’m d##d to her. And what sin did she do to get a child like me? I was already struggling to accept myself, and this pushed me deep into self-hatred. I believed I was a monster. As punishment, she used to lock me in a room for days without any contact with the outside world. Every day she constantly reminded me of how much I don’t deserve to live, and I believed that. I spent months convincing her it was just a phase (it wasn’t, but I had to survive), and she somewhat believed me because she wanted to.

Then things changed. She started joining matrimony sites and started talking to guys to get married. She used to not give food or money for food and leave me in the house for days at a time while she stayed with her boyfriend, then suddenly got married within a few months without telling me. She used to have huge fights over him being an alc#holic, then blame me for everything. Because in her words, “she got married after she lost her daughter and had nobody.” She took out all her anger on me every time and reinforced that I made her life hell. After a few months, she shifted us to his house, which was 2 hours from my college. And I had to share a small room with his son (P, 25). Travelling for 4 hours every day exhausted me and gave me more health issues. They didn’t allow me to shift nearer to college. Staying with my step-brother was a bad experience.

Whenever I asked her for food money, she said that she couldn’t give me anything because she needed money in her account. But she isn’t earning either, so she never has money to pay for my necessities. I ended up either skipping food to save money or taking from my college fund because I had no other choice. My college fees are being paid for by my dad’s parents, as they know my mom can’t pay it. So I’m only depending on her for food and other stuff in my daily life. Whenever I tell my mom and my stepdad that I need them to pay for stuff as I couldn’t, they said it was never their responsibility to. Meanwhile, P gets everything paid for by his dad. Even my stepdad tells my mom not to pay for anything for me because apparently I can manage by myself with my savings. But that’s my savings for the future because I know they won’t help me with anything. The savings were accumulated by saving all the birthday money my grandparents gave me. My parents aren’t allowing me to move out either because then “they can’t control me.” I can’t afford it without their help either.

Now to my relationship with my step-brother. He was nice to me in the beginning. But then the next thing he did was out me to my family. That blew up everything with my mom once again. He then lied about it to me, and I wasn’t sure if my mom was lying or he was. Now I know the truth. This was one of the million lies he told to me and everyone else. He also kept talking about stuff like him being an alpha male, how step-sibling romance is okay, asking in detail about s#x, talking about his d###, fighting and talking loudly with his girlfriend at night so I couldn’t sleep, then his girlfriend spamming and calling me when he ignores her for days, riding his bike with me rashly on purpose whenever he is upset, eating my food, dirtying the bathroom, and lying constantly, amongst other stuff.

My mom also kept telling me about how horrible it was that P lost his mom at a young age like I had lost my dad. Then I found out that P’s parents divorced when P was 21. I was 9 when I watched my dad d#e. I don’t think that’s the same thing.

There was one incident that made things much worse. Mother’s Day. We don’t really celebrate it. My mom lost her sh#t when we didn’t get her anything for Mother’s Day. P didn’t even remember it and doesn’t even do anything for his girlfriend’s birthday, so it was expected. Also, P doesn’t like my mom and hates how she married his dad. He constantly talks about how much he dislikes her using derogatory language. But after my mom yelled at me, in the evening, P told us that he was taking my mom for a drive in his dad’s car. He told me it was only a ride as he didn’t have money, which was true. They didn’t come back for hours. At around 11 p.m., my mom came home, elated. She kept gushing about P. Apparently, he took her to the mall and bought her a 4K dress. He held her hand throughout everything and paid for it. Then took her to an expensive bakery and bought her a cake. My mom never eats cake but did for him. He had written the phrase “Best mom ever” on the cake. He claimed that he did all that because of the pure love he had for her. But he has always tried to “win over” my mom and come in between me and her, so this was his way of making her like him more. Messed up, but my mom was floored.

After a month, he explained that he didn’t have any money, so he didn’t spend it. He said that his dad had given him the money in confidentiality to spend on my mom. That broke my trust with my step-dad and caused issues. But after a few months, he admitted that he lied about it because “he didn’t want me to feel bad.” That was obviously a lie; P never did anything that didn’t benefit him.

But that only brought forth an unhealthy relationship between P and my mom. He constantly insulted her behind her back, but with her, he pretended to be her best friend and kept spreading lies about me. Then something changed, and my mom stopped letting P meet or talk to his girlfriend. He already treated her like trash, but P was so mad. My mom and P kept yelling and fighting whenever his girlfriend or biological mom was brought up. My mom used to cry so often about P talking to his girlfriend, and P used to keep consoling her. My mom started doing more for P, like cooking more, promising more efforts for him, and kept insisting that she did more for him than for her own biological daughter (me). The same issue happened with P’s biological mom too. My mom cried and screamed whenever P talked to his biological mom. She kept throwing fits when P didn’t acknowledge my mom as his mom. P also fed into it, and they both became eerily close. She pandered to his every request while barely listening or bothering about my life. Whenever P’s dad or I tried to talk to her, she would only talk about P and divert every conversation about how P is talking to his biological mom or his girlfriend. P got some sick happiness from it and boasted about how my mom likes him more. Which was sad because I had tried so much for years to make her show some affection to me, but I kept getting disappointed every time, and I had given up.

This continued for a year, with her constantly having breakdowns and P and her making up. She also kept complaining about P to me and wanted P out of the house after his studies. Whenever I needed any help, she always claimed she was too sick to do anything because of P’s behavior. But she was fine; we checked everything with doctors. She made me do her housework after college because she was “sick” and “didn’t want to disturb P.” If I refused, she wouldn’t pay me for food. My stepdad always supported her and took P’s side in every situation. His behavior with me wasn’t great, and I won’t go into detail as it is another topic. I felt so alone in my house all the time because they were one unit, only talking to each other, and only bothered about me when P was involved, in which case I was overreacting because I was a girl. The only thing that got me through all this was my girlfriend R(22), who constantly supported me and kept me sane.

Then a bigger issue. I managed to move out to live closer to my college. They didn’t bother to pay for much, and I had to get the cheapest apartment alone in a shady area. It turned out much worse than expected, and I had to go back home after a while. P’s dad came to pick me up. I reached home. Then I heard loud screaming from my mom. Apparently, P’s dad was drunk. He drank that night because P had done something disappointing. My mom threatened to k#ll herself a few times and tried to jump off the balcony. P’s dad was too out of it to do anything, and P had gone outside. I had to drag my mom to the room with all my strength while she kept thrashing around. I had to hold her down on the bed while she kept wailing and screaming. This went on for hours. It then hit me that P’s dad had driven me home drunk. He had put me in danger. Still, I couldn’t worry about myself or the stuff I had dealt with in my apartment; I had to be the adult and console both of them. The same thing kept happening at other times. And immediately after I managed to sort it out, they would call P, and they would laugh and spend time as a family again.

Then I had to travel with my step-dad for his college reunion in another state. My mom was supposed to go as all his classmates brought their spouses but she didn’t want to travel (leave P alone). There he was drinking for most of the night with his friends and some of them were behaving creepily towards the girls. My step-dad constantly talked about how he wished he had brought his son to show him off. The trip wasn’t a great experience as he kept going off to drink during the day. R, was scared about the situation and kept me company on call throughout. 

There are many incidents that took place which I can’t explain as it would go on and on. Once, P crashed his bike. He was completely fine, but his bike engine had exploded. When P is mad, he tends to break stuff or drive rashly, so his bike wasn’t functioning as a result of it. My parents got mad but fixed the bike and gave it back to him.

Then the next time P was upset, he crashed his friend’s very expensive bike. He got injured and was admitted to the hospital. Minor issues like a bruised shoulder and a cut on his foot. My mom and his dad lost their sh#t. They kept crying while seeing him. Despite the claims of my mom “being sick,” she cooked so much for him late into the night and almost all day. She also kept visiting him in the hospital, which was about 20 km away. Constantly told me to take care of P and make sure he was okay. Moreover, both my mom and P’s dad believe that this accident has transformed P into a new man as God saved him. They praise P for everything, even though he brought this upon himself. They paid for the damages for the bike P had crashed. Now, after he finishes college, they are setting him up with an apartment. 

My mom and P are at home alone most of the time, and they talk constantly, with her using a “baby voice” with him, which creeps me out. P has become completely awestruck by my mom and believes everything she says, like how he is reborn and destined to a great life, despite him not doing anything to work for it. She has also assured that all his dad’s assets will be passed down to him, even though P’s dad wanted to keep something for me, as I have nothing to my name. My mom apparently refused anything to be given to me, and “her son” should get everything. Whenever I told her that sharing a room with him was something I couldn’t handle as I couldn’t pander to his needs along with my work, she lost her mind and yelled at me. She also assigned all the chores to me as now she “can’t deal with anything.” I was completely exhausted and barely had any peace of mind. This situation is still going on, and whenever I bring up that I can’t deal with things, both my mom and P’s dad make fun of me for being such a coward, and that I will never be able to handle life.

Recently, P’s dad gave me a ride to my doctor’s appointment. He continued a conversation he has been having with me for a year. He has been trying to get me to pick up a job similar to his, in the same workplace. Apparently, they both want to have an eye on me always. He also wants a part of my salary to be sent to them after I start working, and it is my obligation to do so; otherwise, he will take it directly from HR. Then he said that they needed a new car and needed my help to buy one later on, as he can’t afford it. I have always refused to help out in the future as they haven’t supported me in any way and only made things worse. Also my profession doesn’t assure a good salary despite it being really hectic. Both my mom and P’s dad are livid that I’m so ungrateful and ready to throw them away after “all that they have done for me.”

All three of them have kept insisting that I’m overreacting and I’m weak, so that’s why “I’m trying to run away by moving out instead of staying like a true family”. In my culture, it is considered a sin to cut yourself off from your family. Deep down, I realized I’m also trying to hold on because without them, I feel like I’m completely alone with nobody to rely on, and that terrifies me. So, am I overreacting?

1kb5k8y,I don't love my father as much as he loves me... and its my mother's fault or so I think,Embarrassed-Estate36,"Context:

 I am a 3rd-year international student at a top uni in Canada, and I just turned 18 in January. Since I have been in Canada ( since 2023), my father, who lives in the US, has never come to see me despite being less than 5 hours away. He says it's because of work, but obviously, nobody works 365 days straight; anyway, he recently applied for a US visiting visa appointment, only letting me know two days before the appointment. Fortunately, I got the 5-year visa. He specifically told me not to inform my mother, as he was convinced she would stop the process as she has done in the past ( I'll explain later). So I didn't. Eventually, he bought a plane ticket for me to come over after my exams for two weeks. Initially, he didn't want me telling my mom until the day I arrived, but I couldn't do that to my mom, as I knew she'd be distraught if so.   

So I called her and I told her about everything, and she immediately said no. She explained that she would like to be in the vicinity when I visit, insisting that she'd be there in case I ""need a place to escape to"", as it is my first time seeing him in 10 years. I  argued that my father would never hurt me, but she said that she had known him longer than I have. I couldn't say anything back. I mean, she is right...I don't know what happened between them before I was born. I couldn't really argue.

Now I had to push back my trip till July, and my dad did not take it well. He kept saying that he waited for me to be an **adult** ( note: I am barely an adult) so I wouldn't be influenced by her. That if I really loved him, I would fight to see him.

And yes, I did argue, but I have my reasons for not disobeying my mother.

My mother and grandmother raised me in an African home, where fathers have the say on every decision made for the child. But somehow, they managed to go against every decision he made: bringing me to the US when I was only one, when he kidnapped me at my first birthday party, arguing that my half-siblings would miss me,  the high school I attended, and the same argument was used. Even when it came to my choice of university, they were focused on universities in Canada despite their arrangement for me to attend school in the US. Though I chose my school because of its prestige and scholarship, my dad is convinced that my mother influenced me to choose it. During my whole childhood, I only saw my dad once and only ever spoke to him on the phone without supervision when I turned 12. Other than a few gifts here and there, he has never been involved in my life financially; only after I got to Canada, he started sending me an allowance, still not asking about my tuition fees, but always asking about my grades.  

From what I understand from my mom, he did something horrific to her before I was born, hence her reasoning for not allowing me to leave with him. Despite what happened between them, she still allowed him to be present to some degree in my life. However, she always made it clear that she didn't like him, and so I was always a little wary of him. I never felt really comfortable with him as he felt like a stranger and he was only my father by name, not by actions.

So yes, I don't love him as much as he does, he wasn't there enough for me to be and left all the responsibility of taking care of me on my mother and grandmother as he raised another family in the US.

If he wanted to, he could have visited more or sent money for my care, even if my mother denied help.

I don't put all the blame on him though, my mother stopped him every chance she got for her own reasons.

I don't know how to tell him this, as it is going to break his heart, and to be honest, I won't feel terrible about it.  I have done fine without him, so building a relationship with him now doesn't benefit me much; it just feels like he wants to take all the glory for being my father, because I was raised well and am now on the path of becoming a doctor despite not helping at all.",1,0,1745979317.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kb5k8y/i_dont_love_my_father_as_much_as_he_loves_me_and/
1kb43nl,Idiot and Controlling Aunt,TechStomper,"so basically, my father passed away this month and because of this, shit is just going south  
I have repeatedly been the level headed one besides my anger as I knew my father was dying of cancer and knew he was in his last few weeks, (he was in the hospital for 3 weeks before this)

I have always been good with death so i figured ""okay to let people grieve as his oldest son, i will be the next of kin to help out and deal with all the paperwork"" whilst my siblings and nanny (grandmother) deal with it. 

this whole plan went south because my father was a stubborn old man who said ""oh don't worry i'll just beat this (he was in renal failure and liver and stomache were shutting down) so he was just lying,"" and had no plan for a will not even a piece of paper

so when we got to the point of who to ""choose"" as the Next of Kin, i told everyone I would handle it since it's just dealing with telling all the bills and landlord that my father had died

this set my brother off and he said actually the most vile and hypocritical stuff i have ever heard come from him including one that in a blind rage caused me to attack him and get the police involved ""Why is he even here he's not even biologically related to dad"" (this is hypocritical cause neither is he) he adopted us when we were basically infants

this lead to my Aunt ""taking over"" and using my nanny (again grandmother we just call her nanny cause she hates being called grandmother)  and using her for everything, my aunt is rich so she decided to fucking have a big funeral that was last minute that very little people showed up because it was LAST MINUTE and also host a 700 dollar funeral party thingey afterwards expecting ME AND MY SIBLINGS along with my mother to pay for it even though we are barely getting by and also just wanted my father cremated and to have the funeral later when we could have all his friends around

The reason this is being brought up is because my aunt the following 4 days later PACKED UP AND LEFT WITH MY GRANDMOTHER with my grandmother being next of kin, ie i now have to find out how to become next of kin myself because a person needs to PHYSICALLY BE THERE to sign alot of papers and my grandmother is A 2 OTHER PROVINCES OVER, ie she can't make the trip because she is 80 years old 

the MAIN issue i have is my mother has been paying for alot of his bills and such and because of this, she is gonna lose out on refund money (we were told we could be given back 400 dollars) but that would go to my grandmother and my aunt WE KNOW would instead convince her that it's gonna be ""her"" money to pay for the stupid fucking again funeral session after that cost 700 ON TOP of the funeral (which thank god was free because my father was on social assistance) ",2,0,1745974859.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kb43nl/idiot_and_controlling_aunt/

1kb22vv,Decided to not move back in with my family,PandaDrinkinBoba,"I just wanted to know if anyone relates to this issue, especially if you are Mexican American.

Here's the context: My family has always gone through financial harships because of my dad. My dad isn't a horrible father, hasn't been abused to me, but if it wasn't for my mother, he wouldn't know how to take care of my younger sister and I. He's very financially irresponsible.

My mom has always been the one responsible for everything. Even though my dad pays for most of the bills, she still has always been working and taking care of me. I respect her for it and love her. I know she's a good mom, and I know she loves me, but she has been my abuser.

Not to get into too many details, but she has caused a lots of mental, verbal, and physical absue that, for many years, made me have crippling self esteem issues (until recently) and I was diagnosed with a form of ptsd. I never liked to accept that I have mental health issues, even now it's hard, because of the way she raised me and victim blamed me, but I have them.

So, when I was 18 turning 19 (I'm 21 now), I moved out because after I graduated high school, she wanted me to immediately go to college when, we didn't have the money, it was hard for me to apply for scholarships because I struggled a lot in school (I barely graduated), and I had no idea what I even wanted. I didn't want to go back to a similar environment when I had struggles a shit ton in high school. Almost every day it was fighting and her trying to gain some more control over me but it became hard because I was 18 and my dad gave his car that was under his name so she couldn't control that.

Now, I live on the opposite side of the country where I used to live. My relationship with my mom became better. Somehow, she even apologized (through text) over a funny, relatable mexican meme about how she treated me. It was still hard for me to be affectionate (and unresolved issues) with my mom, but I didn't want to have any fights over the phone, so we were sweet with each other.

But, not even that long with me living independently, she wanted me to move back. She said it was because I'd have better opportunities with college, and that thr family could support each other financially if me, my best friend (who I moved in with), my mom, and dad were paying for rent. At first, I thought that might be a good idea because I live in a smaller city and not a prosperous city compared to a bigger city where I grew up. But then she said I'd have to share a room with my best friend and that I had to be applying for college while there. Also, my dad tends to get fired a lot, and there have been times while I was gone that my mom told me that we're struggling to pay rent. I was reminded of my family's financial instability. My mom isn't getting as many clients at her job, so she isn't earning as much money.

Then I heard, ever since I had left, my little sister had gone crazy. Became the stereotypical rebellious teen but worse where the cops are constantly called. It made me more hesitant. Trump also got elected, and my family wanted me to be with them in case anything happened. They live in an extremely red state. My mom was telling me word for word that if I just moved in with them, their problems would be solved. My younger sister (who was also horrible to me) would tell me that I'd fix her problems and wouldn't rebel if I came back, and she regrets being mean to me because she realized she didn't want me to move out (even she was hoping I would). I was always told by my mom that I was never the daughter she wanted. I was the bad child, and my sister was the good child because she excelled at school. But now she realizes I wasn't the problem and says I'm her favorite (which I hate that she says that).

The guilt also weighs me down because in mexican families, being there for family, helping each other is important, but I never felt like I was in a good family. My other relatives never wanted to help us or really be there for us. Now I'm getting all this pressure, when in reality, am I really going to be helping them? Will it really be better to be with them? Yeah, I struggle being on my own and I've had tough times but I feel so much more free (my mom was extremely controlling/restrictive my whole life) and now I have a really good paying job and know what I want to do as a career. I could even give them some money to help them. If anything really horrible happened, wouldn't it be good that I'm here in a not so red state? My dad even said he'd be willing to move here with my little sister.

I had told my family multiple times I'm not ready to move, give me a year at least to save up money, but my mom would guilt trip me, reassure me they would be able to financially cover for us for a bit while we look for jobs but my parents are always constantly struggling financially so how? I ended up finally texting my dad to tell my mom my decision (I had told my dad first because my dad is the more passive parent, and we are similar in personality, so he somewhat understood my decison). For now, I have blocked my mom and muted my dad because I have too much anxiety to deal with my mom's reaction. It's to the point that, when I was texting my dad, I was shaking, and my heart rate went up. 

TL,DR: I just want to know if anyone has dealt with making the decision not to move back in with their family for their family having an unstable financial situation, past abuse from family, and just liking where you currently are at now that you had moved out. Am I being selfish for doing this? I feel there is no truly right decision, but I feel better staying where I'm at because I really don't think my family, especially my mom and sister, has changed even though they say they have. And the financial instability in a bigger city, which is way more expensive than where I live, stresses me out.

1kavx2o,Family conflict where the person not responsible is expected to apologize first,Next-Passage-7376,"Hello all. A few months ago, my cousin crossed a line with me. What started as a minor spat escalated into painful and vulgar insults. In the past, he would throw the occasional jabs at me that were always juvenile and I mostly would brush off. But this time, it was too much for me to ignore. After that, I decided to distance myself from him and his family. The problem is, they’re the only family I have where I live. While isolating myself from them, it has made me reflect on all the past hurt he had caused. This further fueled my need to step away and more or less created a disdain towards him. Before this incident, I visited them often. But now I only go for my aunt (his elderly mom) to keep a sense of normal for her. His little kids have noticed my absence. And when they ask why I’m not around as much, I make excuses to ensure they aren’t dragged into this.
 

Recently, I spent an extended time away at another aunt’s home in a different state. While I had other reasons for going in the beginning, the distance from my cousin was a much needed relief. Before leaving, I purposefully told everyone else except for him. At the time, it felt justified. But from what I’ve heard, he noticed and it bothered him. I came back this past weekend. When I went to see everyone for the first time, the tension was still there. The hardest part has been my aunt’s reaction. While driving her to a friend’s house, we talked about the situation, and she got emotional. She told me she’s never seen anything like this between us and that she hates it. She teared up and said I need to fix things. Apparently in our culture, the younger person is expected to make amends even if they weren’t the one at fault.
 

Here’s the thing, I don’t think that’s fair. I wasn’t the one who started this. I only reacted the way I did because I was pushed too far. On top of that, I’m dealing with severe mental health and neurological issues. I’ve made substantial progress in that and I’m worried this conflict threatens to impede on that. Distancing myself wasn’t a malicious act. It was about protecting myself and keeping my peace. Now I’m stuck. My aunt expects me to apologize, but I don’t believe I should have to. When I suggested he should be the one to make things right, she shut it down immediately. I frequently have felt like no has ever understood where I was coming from in my actions. And this only adds to that feeling. I’m almost at my breaking point. Part of me wants to cut ties completely to stand my ground. But I worry about the fallout that can ensue with the rest of the family. Being so close to my wits end, I don’t know what to do at this time. If anyone has any outside perspective or advice to provide on how to move forward, I would really appreciate it.",4,6,1745953132.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kavx2o/family_conflict_where_the_person_not_responsible/

I hate these people they literally disgust me. If anyone speaks highly of them I immediately stop talking to them, they are awful people and I have nobody to tell.

1kal17n,Parents arguing,Frequent_Exam_5501,"Now im not planning to put a wall of text, but, I probably will so most of you understand. Anyways,
(Most of this, was what I heard from my mother. Im not stupid, but shes right on most things)

Now dont get me wrong, I love both my parents and all, but all this has really changed my POV on the both of them, in general, along with many others, and whatnot..

Recently, my parents have been going through money issues, yes, they own a business and arent getting enough money, which is stressing them out, but when they do actually have it, they blow it off on either cigs, alcohol, candy, etc (Im not saying I hate candy, but I have my own money if I wanted candy). Both my parents have asked me for money, my mom only asked one time, while my dad is around, id say, a good 320$ in debt WITH ME (crazy right?!) And I know they borrowed money from others aswell, so theyre in a pretty deep hole as of the moment. Both my parents want jobs, but then denies the other, the chance of getting a job, so, yeah. Two faced, right?

My parents have been arguing DAILY, my dad threatening to leave, and take the kids (me and lil bro), which has my mom, not insane, but insane. Most times when theyre arguing, she'll stop for a few minutes, come in my room to shittalk my father, or just do it in a carride, f.e., Two days ago, my mom wanted to drive me around to look for jobs, its almost the summer, so perfect time, and the whoooole, and i mean WHOLE ride she was nonstop yapping about my father. Honestly, I think something is wrong with her (definitely) since she literally repeated the same question over 20 times (each time i got back in the car), but I can see why, since she has nobody, due to my dad isolating her. Her adoptive family has dementia, and her real family is states away, and not with it either. So all we have is my dads side.

My dad, has gotten, most of his side of the family, to think my mom is crazy, but my uncle, and some others, do occasionally side with her, to help her. They usually come to our house when my dad drives off, gone for hours saying he'll k*ll himself (sorry if this isnt allowed, but) and just recently he installed a voice recorder on his phone to further pressure my mom into doing the thing he wants.

My dad also hits, breaks, and obviously drinks to the point were he's drunk. Hes broken locks, doors, picture frames, etc, and one time (worse imo) made my mothers eye bleed, sprained her wrist, pointed a gun (idk loaded or unloaded), and all that. 

My mom isnt innocent either, but she is stubborn, 3-4 days ago, my dad and mom were arguing, so dad came into my room, to get away from her, and my mom sat there for four fucking hours trying to get him out. He got out after I threatened to call the cops (3rd time now ever) and got into my face when I said 'Get the fuck out,  but I know hes not stupid enough to hit/hurt me (A 16yo)

Honestly, im not trying to set a nuke off in my family, but its getting to a point. I literally have no lunch for school (not eating school shit, no thanks), no snacks/even dinner (we've been eating chicken legs every other day. I hate them now) and my dads still buying beer, cigs for both of them (mom+dad smoke)

When If I dont get to go to uni, then im moving far, far away. Anyways, give me adivce. Again, worst case scenario, I have to go to my school (which ik is a 15/85 of getting a good outcome)

1kaj10d,I'm fed up of this toxic household!,cogitoelevate,"I'm 19F and I live with my father, step mother and two younger stepsisters (12 and 10 yrs old to be precise) and I hate them. I literally have no complains with my mother cause she is as good as a mother can be and that too to a stepdaughter. But I can't not tolerate those girls's behaviour. 

First and of all they are mannerless and my mother pays zero attention to them. Moreover they are a headache always talking back, dancing on my head and are sooo noisy and the elder one has turned into some ""odd hindi movie villain"" kind of a person. Her sole purpose of life is to play and say things about me and yes that's it. 

The only thing that's keeping me sane is that I'm a massive believer! Whenever I get angry i shatter everything that's around me, cry and grab my hairs and scream( all of this in my head of course).
But, that's not how it's gonna work for me. I can't scold them cuz I'm nothing to them. And can't beat them cuz then it'll become a huge scene. Guyss...i cry a lot because though this may not be a very serious issue it is one of them and i just want to get rid of this hold. 

Another thing, i want to go out of station for my graduation but my father's isn't good enough that he can let me stay and speaking about it even if I tell him that I can work out things so that we wouldn't face any financial problem, he says he can't leave me alone that is he means he won't let me go anywhere. 
I can't spend three more years here because life is just going to be more and more tough.

If you all can help me with something or if any of you are in some similar situations please do share your thoughts 😭🙏",1,0,1745915535.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kaj10d/im_fed_up_of_this_toxic_household/
1kaizvs,cousin and aunt hate me (long ass story),Psychological-Emu278,"I got into an argument with my aunt recently, which ended up in my mom and her not talking atm. For context, I work with my aunt and my cousin when I can. While we were working, I commented to my cousin saying ""I wish we could age nicely like our moms"" and my aunt came out of the nowhere and said ""well your mom makes mistakes like a teenager, do you want to be like her now?"" this comment threw me off because although she made it sound like a joke, it didn't feel like one. After all, she made a similar comment to my mom when they were arguing once, so I connected the dots and thought ""this isn't a joke"". After she said that, I laughed nervously and went back to work, but I had that comment in my head for the rest of the evening. When I got home, I debated on whether to tell my mom or not because I felt like I had to, but I ended up falling asleep. The next day, my mom came home for lunch, and I decided to tell her, however, she reacted harshly and asked why I didn't tell my aunt anything at the moment. I told her that I didn't know how to confront her at that moment because I would've said something rude, and my mom never raised me to be rude to anyone and to always be as cool-headed as possible. My mom got up abruptly and left for her office without saying anything to me. I immediately felt guilt and impulsively went to my aunt's house to confront her. But when I tried to say something, I began to tear up and cry because I had a feeling the conversation was going to end horribly (I'm normally not a crybaby, I just love my aunt to death), and it did. my aunt started to argue saying I laughed at her joke and that I was exaggerating what I said, my cousin butt in and said ""yeah you were definitely laughing"", I felt mind boggled and my aunt said ""let me call your mom so I can tell her that you were laughing with us"" I replied and said ""go ahead"", but my mom didn't answer. My aunt began to say that she wasn't going to deal with this and that she can't even hold a conversation with my mom without getting yelled at (context: my mom and I never defend ourselves when my aunt or cousin says anything out of proportion) and that my parents are too emotionally unavailable to take care of me and my siblings properly. She also said that she imagines my mom on a tightrope whenever she makes any decisions, and continued to put her down. long-story short I left her house feeling like a piece of shit and they hugged me thinking I was a victim to my moms manipulation and whatnot. I told my mom how the conversation went. My mom told me she was never angry at me in the first place and that I shouldn't have impulsively gone to confront them. Still, I went home and cried all night because I felt guilty about the situation I caused between them. My mom talked to me and told me that I did nothing wrong and that she's glad I told her about the comment my aunt made. Later that same night, my cousin asked me if I was feeling alright, to which I replied yes and that I realized I'm not a victim of my mom at all and that I will continue to support her. My cousin only replied Good for you. That was the last time my cousin was friendly to me. She would ignore me when I saw her and would walk around me to not cross paths with me, in the beginning, it hurt, but now I'm just plain angry at her bitchy attitude and immaturity because it has nothing to do with her. I get that she's mad because it involves her mom, but not once have I treated either of them like shit because they've disagreed or gotten into arguments with my mom, because 1. my mom is strong asf and can defend herself, and 2. she always told me herself that she feels fine and that I should continue to love and respect them which I did. recently ice came to our apartments and were looking for someone specifically and my parents were scared and hid until they left, since then my cousin and aunt have softened a bit towards us. This only made me angrier because I think it's hypocritical of them to change moods only because something drastic happened; this bipolar behavior is NOT okay. My cousin started to talk and smile, but I kept a cold but respectful demeanor. i prefer for her to treat me like shit because at least I know that's genuine. anyway the question is, am I at fault for speaking up or was it right to say smth",1,1,1745915397.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1kaizvs/cousin_and_aunt_hate_me_long_ass_story/

I’m going to be a freshman in hs soon(Ik I’m young) and my mom 51 keeps trying to blame me for her poor parenting choices. We recently got evicted because of the state of our living room and my sister’s room. Our landlord has been on her case about the clutter since 2014 and she just keeps putting it to the side. Our landlord gave us the notice almost 3 months ago and has extended our stay a bit so we could pack up, my mom made excuses on why she hasn’t found us a knew place to stay and now she’s trying to move into a camper, I can’t do that, I’d have to little space and I don’t want to fight with my sister. My dad 57, has only sided with my mom throughout this whole thing. I always did my best to keep my space clean, and I took care of our cat, and always had home work and I’m the only one who would ever clean the only bathroom we had to share between 4 people. Not only all this but before my parents got married sometimes my mom would get angry at me and my sister for being annoying and wouldn’t feed us dinner that night when we were around 5 and 6. She also used to beet me with a belt so bad that there would be huge red marks on my back. And I’ve recently tried to get her to take me to a therapist.

I honestly never want to talk to her again after I turn 18. I’m staying at a friend’s house with most of my stuff (and my sister 13) and my cat is at my grandmas house.

1ka2pqg,Toxic parents kicking me out — need advice,toastwiththemost03,"I’m 21F and have always had a rocky relationship with my parents. The strict curfews, yelling, and punishments have been a problem. I’ve been kicked out before for staying out late. I take care of all my own responsibilities. I pay my own bills, help with some of theirs, buy my own food, and handle my own life. I just wish I wouldn’t be treated like a child.

When I stay out late, it’s never past midnight. I’m not coming home stumbling drunk or disturbing anyone, just trying to have a normal social life. I know if I wanted more freedom, I should’ve moved out sooner, but I wasn’t financially able to until now. I’m currently looking for a place to stay.

In January, my dad slapped me during an argument over my car when I tried leaving the house to see a movie with my ex (which is under my name) and gave me a black eye. I chose not to press charges, worried I would make things worse. I haven’t spoken to him since. My mom often gives me the silent treatment whenever she doesn’t agree with something I say. There’s no real communication in our household, just yelling, punishments, and more yelling. No apologies, no real conversations. Recently, after I told him I’d report him if he kept threatening me, my mom came in screaming at me. Now they’re kicking me out and taking me off the car and health insurance.

I get that my actions have consequences, but this feels extreme. Would it be worth it to report my dad? I know there’s not really much I can do anyways since technically they are able to do that, but any advice would really help. Thanks for reading.

Also, for context for these texts. On Saturday, I didn’t come home until about 11:30pm and I got these texts from my dad shortly after. Soon after I sent that text to my dad, my mom started pounding at my door and unlocked it to come in and scream at me at 12 a.m. and then sent me those messages lol

1ka0b2h,Need help dealing with this stress,Rectorious_712,"Im 22m living with my mother, and recently she's feeling stressed due to some payments for my grandfather's funeral costs (different county, so not sure how it works) and is essentially putting the trust in my 3rd brother (we're 4) to make the payments.

Some background... she managed to bring all of them from their home country to the US by the time I became 14. The 3rd brother (John), was here the shortest amount of time, only like 8-9 months, and left for 2 reasons, 1 because he was tired of the ""American Dream"" and 2 he wanted to be with some girl (they separated shortly after though). My mother was devastated and depressed, but thankfully recovered through faith. My eldest brother(Mike) would leave a bit after to pursue his education back home. Keep in mind, both left with a big amount of cash back home, only Mike was smart enough to leave it to our mom to gradually send it back. The 2nd oldest(Steve) is the black sheep, so you know the rebellious type and did his own thing, but is still here in the US.

  
So years later, John met someone else, has a daughter and a son on the way. Mike managed to finish his equivalence of a GED and is a supervisor at some company and has a spouse(no kid), and as for Steve, he's met someone, has 3 kids and a stepson. But I want to mention, except for Mike, the ways they met their spouses weren't on purpose, they kinda just went with the ""flow"" and played around. Funny when I write this since it sounds like they're the youngest, but they were like mid/late 20s when they had their first kids. 

So lets get to the topic, my gramps passed away this past January, he was living with John who was taking care of him in his final days (he has a big attachment as he took care of John as a boy when our mother was in the US working to brig them), and from what I heard, my mother(also uncle + aunt) has to pay a monthly cost back to their home country for where he is buried. John volunteered to go to the office to make the payments, all was well until recently. My mother received a payment of an overdue bill for the month of March but John sent us a receipt of the payment (1 day late) so we assumed that it was the office's protocol to send that notice out. In between this time, he would ask for some $$ to help out around the home, his daughter/robbed phone/etc. But it would be strange that he wouldn't tell us what exactly he did with the money, and would emphasize speaking with him on serious matters, not even his spouse(ok gal, better  compared to Steve's). And as there's nobody who can confirm at the office since he recently had his phone stolen, my mom's been on edge. But what I always found odd was the way he would ask for $$, not like expecting money , but always having an issue where he's short on cash. And our mom being sympathetic for her grandbaby, would send something, hell even I did the first few times. But when he called me ""personally"" about sending a larger amount but without mom knowing, is when I realized he's taking it too far. After that, he stopped with the casual calls to ask how I was doing and went back to talking solely to mom. I mean I never said anything rude, but I was upfront that the amount he was asking would make me go broke(college so yeah). I'd say he doesn't truly realize the effort of making cash as he was in the country for less than a year, while my other 2 brothers we here +7 years. So he managed to get a new phone but hasn't checked in with our mom (his spouse told us) and as I said, my mom is stressed about it because if the contract is broken, the company will have to remove the casket from where its buried till a new contract is made (I don't think any of yall would want to be in a situation with yalls parents like this). And all of this situation is making me tense as I'm concerned for her health.",1,0,1745858917.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ka0b2h/need_help_dealing_with_this_stress/

1k9t1op,Am I the AH for pointing out the double standards in my family?,SourceOutrageous1455,"Am I the AH for pointing out the double standards in my family?

My mom (59), Chas(M 34) , Dwayne (M 25) and I (F 29) all live in the same apartment complex but in 2 apartments. 
Right now, my mom,stepdad and I in one apartment and Chas and Dwayne in one.

I talk to my mom about how unfair it is for her and myself to take care of my stepdad because he has early dementia. I am officially the home care giver but only getting paid minimum wage and 30 hours a week but my mom and I care for him 24/7. 

Meanwhile, my brothers Chas and Dwayne are living my apartment (technically but that’s another story) and they literally do nothing to help my mom and I with our stepdad. They each probably contributed less than $30 in clothes for our stepdad once a year for Christmas/his birthday. 
Neither of them have ever bought him food, take him outside, clean him or his room, or change his diapers. 
Chas will at least “watch” him aka monitors him to not escape the apartment, and feed him premade meals but does NOT help change his diapers when mom and I are busy working our other jobs. 

You would think Dwayne would help especially because our stepdad raised him since he was 2 yrs old but he doesn’t. He was working at amazon for 6 months but is now unemployed and receiving unemployment for about 3 months now.  Dwayne literally does nothing to help. He doesn’t even visit our stepdad to talk to him or take him to a park to walk around. I guess he’s too busy having sex with his unemployed gf. 

Don’t get me started on Dwayne and his gf. I let Dwayne and Chas live in my apartment for 2 years thinking they would rebuild their life because they just started new jobs. 

I also said that they can’t bring any gf/bfs to MY apartment that I am letting them stay in. 

Dwayne gets a new gf (who is unemployed) and she is there 6 days a week. I can’t! The disrespect. 

I noticed her car in “my” parking spot almost everyday. I texted Dwayne that she can’t live in my apartment. Dwayne gets angry and tells me to fuk off. Since he wants to disrespect me, I told Dwayne he needs to move out in 1 year (instead of 2 years). 
Dwayne gets pissed off and tells Chas about it. Chas is now pissed at me. 

I am frustrated because Chas lets Dwayne’s gf sleepover there 6 days a week. 
Why am I frustrated?
Because when I lived with Chas, he did NOT let me have my bf (at the time) in our apartment. Double standards?!?!


Chas is ok working at Target but Dwayne (25) is has been unemployed for 3 months now. Dwayne is pissing me off. Why? Because he pulled this shit 2 years ago at Chas’ apartment! Chas had his own apartment 2 years ago and let Dwayne (he was unemployed at the time) live in it for 1 year with his then gf who was also unemployed. Chas was paying rent for 1 year for Dwayne and his gf while they were unemployed. Dwayne didn’t pay back Chas any money. When I confront Chas on why Dwayne doesnt pay back any of the $12,000+ of rent, Chas yelled at me and threw a box at me. 

You may ask, why do you care? Just let them be. Sure. Fine.

But why does noone else me when I need help? Why do my brothers not help with our stepdad? Why are my mom and I cleaning poop and pee everyday and the apartment still smells like shit?!

I asked Chas for money maybe 3 times when we lived together and I always paid him back. Why does Dwayne get to live rent free in Chas’ apartment for a whole year?! 
Btw, Chas’ lost his apartment because the rent was getting too expensive and Dwayne didn’t care. Dwayne didn’t get a job and Chas got evicted. 

My mom doesn’t care how any of this hurts me. My mom actually started chasing me when we had any argument and she fell on the floor. I had to call 911 because I couldn’t get her up. 
My mom actively tells me I need to find a “better” job when I was 2 jobs already. But I don’t see her nagging Dwayne to get a job. 

Long story short: My mom and older brother let my little brother do whatever he wants but when I point it out, I am the bad “guy” for “tearing” this family apart.

1k9onxk,Physically threatened by my (35M) brother,lamaze-ing,"So my older brother has always been a hyper-masculine and aggressive individual, and he’s recently become infatuated with conspiracy theories, Trump, and New Age enlightenment politics. In a recent conversation we had some disagreement over trans rights issues. 

I(29m) tried to reason with him about the psychological weight that prejudice and bigotry carries with it and he became extremely argumentative, yelling, telling me to “cease” as I was speaking, that sort of thing. The next day he left pretty quickly, as he was visiting at my parents place, where I live. 

He later called my parents and apologized for leaving so suddenly, and explained that he “could not stand to be around” me because of the “intense waves of energy” I was sending him. He compared me to a homeless meth addict, implied that I was evil, and said if I ever did that again I would “end up on the floor”, clearly threatening physical violence. 

My parents seemed bothered by this but told me not to take it too seriously and to simply be more careful about how I talk to him. He definitely has a pattern of getting in arguments with family over anything, but to my knowledge this is the first time he’s threatened anybody physically since he was a teenager at least. I am a gay man and I feel convinced that it is only a matter of time before he does act on this.

I tried to talk to my parents about it and I was able to get good confirmation from my dad that he would cut ties if this were to happen and my brother would no longer be welcome at the house or family gatherings etc. my mom however seems totally willing to look the other way, and would rather take my brothers word on how “enlightened” he his than critically look at his actions. 

It’s incredibly disheartening to know that it would have to get so extreme for them to even consider taking estrangement seriously, but again I feel it is only a matter of time.

I was upset cuz i just wanted to live the dad experience with him .. anyways my sister got engaged to a very rich man and since that day she switched into an evil person she would mock me for my past life like i worked as a waitress she would bring up my past mistakes just to drag me down and call me a black cuz she is whiter than me and she never used to call me this nickname before the last thing she did that she told my father that im jealous of her after all i did for her i feel so so so hurt i treated her better than myself do i deserve this ??

1k9j491,I'm tired of my grandma enabling my drug-addicted mom and blaming me for everything.,Dumbreposter,"I (16F) live with my grandma (69F), who has temporary custody of me. My dad (42M) technically has full legal custody — he was granted that when CPS took me away from my mom when I was about six years old because of her addiction and unsafe living conditions. After that, I lived with my dad in Colorado for about eight months, but it was a very neglectful situation (a whole different story). After he divorced his then-wife, he basically forced my grandma to take me back — and I haven’t seen him in person since then. It's been almost ten years. We barely text, he doesn’t pay child support, and even though he technically still has custody, he’s not meaningfully involved in my life at all. My grandma has had ""temporary custody"" this entire time, even though it’s basically permanent now.



As for my mom: she has struggled with drug addiction since her early teens. When she was about 18, my grandparents forced her to go to rehab, and she got sober from drugs for about nine years. I was born during that sober period. However, even during those years, she still drank heavily, partied, and relied on my grandparents to co-parent me. My grandparents felt bad for her because she was a single mother, but she definitely took advantage of them.



Even before drugs, my mom never acted like a real parent. I was more like her emotional support system. She would pull me close when she wanted affection and when it suited her but push me away when annoyed and/or dump me on my grandparents. She was extremely short-tempered and disciplined me unnecessarily, which even my grandparents admitted, and lacked any maternal instinct. It’s always felt like she wanted someone to love her, not someone she needed to care for.



Now, my grandma keeps letting my mom come stay with us. She justifies it because my mom goes to a methadone clinic twice a week. For anyone who doesn’t know: methadone is supposed to help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms if someone is committed to recovery. Patients are supposed to come in consistently to get their doses. But if they miss days or continue using illegal drugs, their methadone dose resets lower, and they have to slowly work back up to a stable amount. It’s meant to stabilize recovery — but only if someone actually stops using. But my mom still leaves for days or weeks on drug binges, resets her methadone dosage, and gives our home address to dealers. We've had random people show up to our house delivering drugs and my grandma is well aware and OK with this.



Last week, I finally convinced my grandma that the methadone clinic wasn't working. We took my mom to the hospital to try and get her help with withdrawal symptoms. However, she had clearly just used drugs right before we brought her in. The hospital told us they couldn’t really help — unless she was actively going through life-threatening withdrawal, like literally to the point of not breathing, they couldn’t treat her. I’ve seen my mom go through severe withdrawals before — vomiting, shaking, barely able to function — but unless she’s literally dying in front of them, they won't medically intervene. The hospital did offer to get her into a detox center immediately. I thought that was the best course of action because detox would stabilize her and actually make rehab a realistic next step. But my mom refused. She said she didn’t want to go to detox, only straight into rehab. Despite knowing (because I confirmed it with the staff) that most rehabs require detox first — and despite knowing there are long waiting lists for almost all rehabs — my grandma decided to ""respect her wishes"" and refused to push her into detox. She said my mom “needs to want it herself” and she “won’t force her.” I get that you can’t force someone into recovery, but it feels like just another excuse to keep enabling her.



That same night, my grandma made a deal with my mom: If my mom stayed at our house and didn’t run off on another binge, she wouldn’t force her to go to detox and would only make her go straight to rehab instead.



My mom ran off the very next night after that hospital visit — and she hasn’t been back since.



Meanwhile, when she’s here, I’m stuck making rehab calls, doctor appointments, and letting her use my phone to contact dealers because she keeps losing hers. Only in the past month or two has my grandma even refused to drive her around — but she still keeps letting her stay and making excuses for her as well as paying for her drugs.



Whenever I try to set boundaries, my grandma gets defensive and blames me. She says if I didn’t want my mom here, I wouldn’t help. She brings up how when I was little I used to beg for my mom to stay — even though for the past three years I’ve told her to leave multiple times. Everyone keeps telling me to ""give my grandma grace"" because it’s her daughter. I get that emotionally. But I feel stuck. I’m tired of parenting both my mom and my grandma while they make excuses and I’m the only one acting logically. Even when my mom isn’t here, I’m still emotionally regulating my grandma.



At the end of the day, I’m still just a teenager. I turn 18 in two years, and I’m planning to move out as soon as I can because even my relationship with my grandma is complicated. She has her own verbally abusive tendencies — the same ones my mom experienced growing up. I’m just so emotionally exhausted. I feel like no matter what I do, I’ll always be seen as the bad guy for trying to protect myself.

  
Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. I would also really appreciate any advice if anyone has any.",1,2,1745801189.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k9j491/im_tired_of_my_grandma_enabling_my_drugaddicted/
1k9h14a,Take in charge your family,Advanced-cat-brain,"Hello, 

I would like to share my state with you, I am a young graduate that will start her first job in very soon. I also is the middle child, so I have an elder sibling that was working years ago and also was taking in charge my family. She helped in groceries, electricity bills and my other sibling school fees etc, and this sibling also helped me financially during my studies. 
Now that I will work, they decided to stop completely helping my parents. And I will take the responsibility of everything, knowing that when they were helping,I was a student and didn't have money to help or whatever. Now, I do find it injust to take over everything while they get their full salary, but I need to literally give a half of my salary and live with the other half, in order to help my family ( as you already guest, my family can't afford their own Living ) 

I wanted to do half charges with my sibling, but they said no, they said that I need also to suffer as she did, but I literally didn't chose to be born later and be a student while she works...

1k9fgag,My (21) sister (19F) is in a very frowned upon relationship with a family friend (35?M),Legal-Jelly7176,"TW: Grooming, Corruption of a Minor, Statutory Rxxe, Child Molxxtation

  
""Very frowned upon"" doesn't even begin to describe it. I just didn't know if I could put ""~~Pedophilic~~"" in the title. TLDR: My sister (19F) has recently came forward with the truth that she has had a sexual relationship with a very close family friend (35?M) for a while and it's destroying my family. 

For context, around 4.5 years ago FF came back into our lives after a very long struggle with addiction and being sentenced for a few years for fraud; all in all coming to around 6 years missing. He was a work friend of my mom's who she had introduced to my sister and I when we had first moved back in with her after a few years. In catching up with him, we learned he had a child around when we stopped seeing him as well as the arrest. At the time he had moved back in with his mom, where he had been living until she kicked him out around October of last year. When FF first came back into our lives dad was already distrusting and didn't want him around, but ended up settling a little while later. There was a bunch of fighting and whatnot between everybody, even just between my dad and I for anything about it. FF was being very fatherly towards my sister and I just saw him as an older brother at the time, thinking nothing of it. It was never anything crazy like overnight trips or anything where I should be concerned. In addition, my sister and I were both ~~molested~~ 13 years ago by a boyfriend of our moms, and have always been taught not to trust any sexual advances from older men. 

A few months after FF had come back into our lives, my sister (15 at the time) told us she had contracted chlamydia from a man (22) who she had been seeing for over 2 years in the two bedroom apartment that her, my mom and I shared. We had an unspoken rule that the only men allowed in the house outside of family were FF and my partner. I felt betrayed and that my safe space was tainted, so I moved in with my partner. FF had set up one final meeting between my sister and the man which FF used to bait him into the house to beat him. Unfortunately due to the vigilante act that FF committed if we pressed charges on 22yo he would press charges on FF for assault. At the time, it seemed it was out of jealousy but I dismissed it as ""protecting a younger sibling"".

Last July a childhood friend of my sister and I came forward and told me that my sister had been in a sexual relationship with him (that she had initiated) for years, which I had confronted her about. She denied it and eventually everybody stopped worrying about it and just dismissed it as something to stir up trouble. Around two weeks ago, I was on a phone call with childhood friend and was planning to hang out with her a few days after when she had brought it up again. I brushed it off but she insisted she wasn't lying to me at all and that it had been going on for a long time (all of this being information she received from my sister directly). I had once again confronted my sister, who once again denied it but finally came forward after I grilled her for a while. She had said that it was only from last October to now, which was absolutely infuriating. I immediately told our mom, and my sister told our dad because she was afraid he would find out from me (he's locked up for a long time so phone calls only). We're the only thing that our dad has left, and he absolutely lost it when he heard about it.  After about a week I stopped caring because I was so fed up with all the fighting and thought that she's an adult and although I frown upon it, I can't change her mind. 

Now, the fun part. A few days ago, my dad was grilling my sister on a phone call when she came clean about everything. They had been seeing each other for **4 years**. She was 15 at the time of when they had started this relationship. And then, everything just spirals downhill. Immediately my dad told both myself and my mom. I called sister, who confirmed the information and seemed to just not care that it was out. I then called FF and told him I felt betrayed and don't want anything to do with him ever again. FF calls sister and asks why the information came out. Dad had called mom so angrily and just kept pushing buttons until mom wanted a divorce (she's calmed down since but won't talk to him because of how he treats us). 

Last night I had a conversation with both my sister and FF, who claimed they wanted to have a relationship and move in with each other. I called them lunatics and slapped him if they think I'm going to sit here and accept that. At this point, my life feels like a lie and I don't know if I'm going to speak to my sister again. I know for a fact that if I see FF at a family event its either a fight or I'm leaving. 

I don't even know what I need right now, whether it be advice or just words of kindness, but I appreciate anything and thank you for your time. ",1,0,1745790464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k9fgag/my_21_sister_19f_is_in_a_very_frowned_upon/
1k9bevd,How to tell my family I’m not moving back home after college?,FormalBeatboxing,"For starters, I do love my family a lot and they have been very supportive of me in a lot of ways, especially financially this past year. However, I graduate college this August, and I have no intention of coming back home. This past year, every time I have visited home there has been some sort of chaos and dysfunction, which has led me to feel very frustrated with my family. They do not treat me like an adult and are always on my case about things I don’t need their help with. At the same time, they also unload all their issues on me as soon as I get home and can’t seem to take care of basic things on their own, which really overwhelms me. Overall, I am constantly irritated when I am home and just really need at least another year of space. 

I’m graduating a year early, which the original reason was to avoid additional housing costs (oops). My current roommate’s housing plans for the following year fell through and she asked if I would be willing to live with her another year. I really don’t want to move back home, but I know I will deeply upset my parents when I tell them I am not coming back. We are a Hispanic household, so it is expected for the children to live at home until they get married, so the idea of spending extra money on rent will seem unnecessary to them. I currently have a job that doesn’t pay very well, but I am actively looking for better jobs where I currently am at so I can at least be able to financially support myself. A factor I am very worried about is that I got my license fairly recently and do not have a car which really limits the career opportunities I can take. My family isn’t doing super well financially, and every time I want to bring up the fact I need a car it seems like they are always more in the hole, so I might need to figure out how to buy a car on my own.

All that being said, if anyone could take into consideration the context of my situation and give me some advice on how to gently tell my family this news I would greatly appreciate it. As much as I would like to go off on them and tell them how crazy they are making me, I know it would only hurt them and not support my decision even more.",1,0,1745779994.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k9bevd/how_to_tell_my_family_im_not_moving_back_home/
1k9awdi,My mother says that money isn’t the issue…,Low-Thanks-4316,"My mother is 77 years old and she hasn’t retired. At the same time, she has a soon-to-be 12 year old to raise. My parents adopted her, but my father died last year so it leaves my mother the full responsibility of this little girl when she doesn’t even want to. I know it’s an obligation that my father left her with, but she was never there for her. My father retired to stay home with this little girl while my mother continued to work which meant that my mother was in another city all week and only spent two days at home.

I wondered why my siblings were so interested in this little girl and then I found the source. Because she is adopted, my mother receives $900+ for her. And on top of that, my father’s SS goes to… You guessed it… My mother kicked my sisters out and my lil brother is trying to convince my mother to move out of state. 

I saw that my mother didn’t look good. It concerned me so I just showed up one day. I’ve been here for a little over a month and so far I can see that my mother neglects her. She’ll make herself a nice fat meal but she gives the little one cold cereal. I recently bought her shoes because my mother says she doesn’t need them but my mother has shoes she doesn’t even wear. 

She says that my nieces come to take her shopping and I realized why. Their father is our oldest sibling and my father left him in charge of his bank accounts. they should have been the ones to buy her shoe.

1k8xyi6,Once called “Family”,Ai-ku,"**Once called “Family”**

I have a father who is super religious, outgoing, never drinks or smokes, and is attractive to everyone, but he still cheated. He promised to take care of us until graduation, but found a new family and passed the responsibility to his siblings and two eldest children to care for his children. My mother is bright, beautiful, and family-oriented. She makes jokes to anyone until she is mentally unstable for over 18 years of her life wasted on men who cheat multiple times, and a husband’s mother who doesn’t like her and likes his ex-girlfriend. She gave birth to four children with love and hope. She stopped her work and her school to take care of us, and yet he reasons she wasn’t sexually active and always argues with him after work because she lost her trust in him ever since. She lost her true self to be with him, who fooled her with just the bare minimum of sending letters and flowers from an office. They both regret being married at 27 years old and aren't mentally and physically prepared to start a family. They were separated when two younger siblings were going to enroll in college. So they made four children suffer the same fate, to make us feel what they have experienced, as if the promise wasn’t even made. She ran away from home, which we thought was a vacation, but after five months had passed, she texted that she would never come back. The first eldest child lived and graduated with the support of relatives and bears the responsibility to take care of the grandparents’ financial and other siblings. The second child bears the responsibility of taking her two younger siblings until she finally has work and freedom from her father. The third child has outstanding grades and was accepted into a big university, but was rejected by her father’s approval to go to a local university instead. She got depressed, and her image of an ideal family was broken. Youngest sibling found a job with a course that is flexible to his work schedule, and he can afford things he used to. 

I was a third sibling, a middle child who lived in constant emotional and psychological abuse from my own family. I took the course in Nursing to be able to help people who have the same experience as my struggles. I was the invisible child who had no interests like the rest of my siblings. I tried to be a normal sibling, but I was ignored. I tried to be something good, but it wasn’t enough. I started having normal conversations with them, but I was a laughingstock. So I stopped, and they were bothered. Whenever I was happy, they were bothered.

I studied hard and couldn't get a part-time job due to hectic schedules as a student nurse who always has multiple quizzes, activities, exams, and patients to take care of but they couldn’t comprehend what it feels like to be a Nursing Student, so they were forcing me to work or shift courses. I have a whole week school schedule which has 4-8 hours a day of school, and the rest of the hours will be spent reviewing notes, research, and performance. I defended myself throughout my life, to the people who thought I was naive, useless, a burden, and a worthless person who only cares about school, they were the people who had the same blood as me. A simple help will make them filled with anger, so I have a fear of asking for help, thinking they will do the same thing. Many companions say I have to endure their negative actions toward me, the only way to survive is to suffer from my very own source of income to get me to school. But every day is a living hell to me. I went home with little food, a bunk bed that’s too hot for me to bear away from the aircon, a bathroom with a lot of cockroaches, and a broken sink, but I didn’t waver. I compare myself to my own classmates’ families; they made them lunch boxes, and have loving parents and siblings, which I could never experience. I started feeling suicidal to the point that I would rather kill myself than live my life with this surname that I considered as their family. My father couldn’t even understand what he did wrong to cheat and expect everyone to forgive him. I have to listen to his constant complaints every day about why a father will take care of us, and yet, he is not hesitant to take care of his new family. He will come home just to work and feed the pets while bringing luxurious food from a so-called new family. And yet my siblings did not understand my experience, only took my studying as a way to make an excuse, and they did not value my feelings. Only I was asked for a school allowance, and didn’t bother with their lives. They neglected my feelings, so I will give them the same treatment as they did.

One day, after graduation, if I’m still alive, I need to go away from that city and live far away from them. I will be finally free of still wanting their validation. I now have trust issues, depression, anti-social, and over-explaining stuff. If I ever make my own family, I will love my husband and my children and prioritize them the most, hoping they will not experience the same that I did. I wish my children would love and depend on each other.

I still remember the day my youngest sibling told me things, so many insults, and criticism. Someone who told me to continue my suicide attempt. Someone who cheered you up when you called me your sister when you were young. Second eldest child, she was my inspiration and a role model, although she looked at me as a worthless and annoying sibling. To my eldest brother, who is sarcastic and laughs at my existence, and is engaged, congratulations. 

I have met people, completely different from them, who ask for help isn’t a burden. They made me feel like I was needed and someone to talk to. They helped me overcome these fears, and I was able to do things I couldn't before. They were the problem all this time. I do hope those who have the same experience as me will be successful and achieve their dreams. To all my friends, my uncle, and my loving significant other that I love, they will always be in my heart. I don't know how much I can repay you all, thank you so much.

1k8vh0h,Should I be offended by a joke my brother made regarding my medical condition?,Ok-8675309,"This happened six years ago.  I had been having difficulty and constant need to take leave from work due to anxiety, depression, and ideation issues.  My body began to break down and in consultation with my psychiatrist I realized I needed to leave my job.  I shared the information with my older brothers, the eldest of which is 12 years older than I.  At the time he would have been in his late 60s.  Our family, especially my brother often deals with difficult topics by joking.  But at the time I was speaking with him I was sharing how my body was shutting down and that the doctor had described medication that had also been used to treat PTSD because I was waking up in the morning with my body vibrating, just literally shaking so hard it was vibrating.  My brother responded with a chuckle and said couldn’t you just flip off the switch?  Mind you was I very vulnerable and in a lot of pain, emotionally sharing something with someone with whom I don’t fully trust and yet desperately wanted to have him understand what I was going through and I knew immediately he was making a joke that my body was vibrating because I didn’t turn off a vibrator.  I resented the sexual innuendo joke immediately but as I’ve been trained to do in my family, I chuckled with him although I did say that’s not what it is and it really wasn’t appropriate.  From that point forward for a few years I basically went no contact.  There’s a whole bunch of other issues now that I won’t address at this point, but it still stays with me wondering if I overreacted to what he said, if I should be more forgiving or if I need to just finally let it go and let him go away from his toxicity? I think the reason this is coming up so hard for me again right now is because I’m in financial straits and I’d like to think I could reach out to him for help.  I haven’t directly, but our other brother has on my behalf, and when my oldest brother wanted to have some questions answered, he went to our other brother instead of coming to me.  All of this frustrated our other brother because it put him in the middle (which he did kind of do that by his own choice when he reached out on my behalf) and I sent an email to my eldest brother that said hey I understand you reached out to our brother with some questions and I just wanted to say it’s OK to contact me directly and I’d prefer that rather than put our brother in the middle.  His response was that I’d berated him, and therefore, he and his wife were no longer going to be of any assistance to me now or in the future.  I honestly am a myriad of emotions right now trying to figure out where I messed up or if I’m expecting too much from someone who isn’t capable of being a real brother.  So basically should I have been offended with his joking, about a medical diagnosis and taking offense at a request to please direct questions to me rather than through our brother?  I’m feeling really stuck and trying to figure this out, so I appreciate your gentle and kind thoughts and comments.  It’s kind of a situation where I can’t see the forest for the trees and when that happens, I typically fall back to assuming I’m the one at fault and I need to apologize to those that have hurt me.",2,0,1745727377.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k8vh0h/should_i_be_offended_by_a_joke_my_brother_made/
1k8uv2y,What do i do if my mom only favors my immature sister in every situation?,Character-Floor-332,"i am a young teenage girl and I have a sister who is 16 and is a few years older than me. my sister often acts very immature for her age and she has never been caring or sharing to me. She often copies my mannerism what i say and what I wear even down to my music taste. Now you might think maybe she js has similar taste but thats not it i will do something at home like stand in a specific way and she will do the same thing when we are out and when i say new phrases i like, for example i will say oh my skib as a joke and i know its popular but she doesnt know what it is and asked me and then started saying it around and i didnt have a problem with that but when I started developing my fashion taste she started buying the same things i bought often interrogating me on what i bought but when i ask her she gatekeeps and when i let her buy the same things she wears them on the same day as me and when i ask her to change she refuses i dont want to match because i want to be my own person and not ""oh ur her sister"" and often people think i copy her when i dont. She even went as dar as to ask me to send her my playlist and downloas the whole thing and show it off to people saying its her own amazing music taste. Its not cute or twinning because shes putting on a facade to be me and doesnt even give me credit. She also tells me she hates things like makeup and nails and kpop but when i got into them and started listening to kpop and doing my nails and wearing makeup she started doing those things and for listening to kpop she was telling others i was copying her. This really bothered me but i just let it go and when she saw me doing my nails and start doing nail art she hated it at first but was now obsessed with using MY items to design nails and lie to me about stealing them. She hated makeup and judged me for it making me insecure for my hobby and saying i was a sephora kid even though i never wore makeup out and did it for fun but as soon as i got more comfortable wearing makeup out she started using it and saying she loves makeup. She would often steal my things like my surgery scar cream and use it for herself even though she never had a scar from surgery and she wouldn't apologize she would js say oops. I was often blamed for her losing things even though shed find it later id never get an apology. She steals my clothes makeup skincare and everything i have. It geniunley annoys me and i cant handle it. She never shares or considers my feelings. I will ask her for some food sometimes and she calls me a fatty even though she knows im insecure about my weight. she bothered for so long that one summer i had a ed and wouldnt eat anything but dinner because my mom would force me to eat she also has situations where my mom cant pick us both up and forces me to stay afterschool alone and my sister wont pick up her phone so my mom has me go search the whole school for her. Im not her servant and im sick of it but my mom tells me to quit whining. My sister will stare at me and judge me and even yell out my problems to others and make fun of me. There is so much more she does like one time i lost all my friends because they bullied me and she told everyone about it and said she had to babysit me because im a loser who lost her friends. i got in a fight with a friend before too and she yelled it out at everyone and i was so angry and she didnt even sya sorry but was mad at me for confronting her. There is a lot more but i already listed ONLY A FEW problems. My mom on the other hand will always stand up for my sister as she is her favorite child. My mom will tell me that I need to take care of MY OLDER sister and that i should stop acting like a baby. She tells me to deal with it and she doesnt care about me. Today I got in a fight with my sister because when she was eatiing dinner she didnt save any radish for me and lied saying there was only two left but before i showered i checked the fridge and there were like 12 pieces left. She ate them all and while i was telling her to save some she ate the second to last one in my face. I felt so angry but just sat down and ignored it. My mom then came to us and was asking us what i was whining about when i didnt even whine and my sister said shes mad because i didnt save any for her and my mom was like get over it. Then i went to my room and my mom called me out to get my stuff and since I was angry i didnt say anything or even look at her and got my stuff and she told me i was immature and should stop giving her attitude. She yelled at me more and told me to go sleep if i was gonna be annoying. I dont know what to do especially because they talk bad about me right behind me when im there and can hear them even though they know i have trauma of people talking bad about me because my old fg talked bad about me so much and bullied me to an extent i almost transferred schools. When I try to be nice and talk to my sister she ignores me often and pretends i dont exist which obviously annoys me and my mom just says to stop bothering her because shes busy when shes watching reels on her phone and just tells me to let it go because im acting like a baby. They never listen to me and its always my fault to them so what should i do. I plan on ignoring them and stop caring for them as im tired. Maybe they will see how much it will impact them after i stop carrying them on my shoulders and doing whatever they ask of me",2,2,1745725234.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k8uv2y/what_do_i_do_if_my_mom_only_favors_my_immature/

with people and realizing that i don’t talk to my parents and if my friends get loud, i put headphones in or leave. i remember because this was 5 days ago. i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to

1k8tegz,I waited for my Prince Charming and want a divorce,Hopeful-Ad2167,"Sooo, I’m struggling with so many things…. 
Long story short - I met my ex husband as a teen. We fell in love got married , had some kids and then he gets with a friend and they have been married for 7 years and have kids of their own. 

For 3 years during my separation/ divorce I focused solely on my kids and rebuilding my life. I found God , worked hard , enrolled in school and finished my degree. 

I eventually started dating …. I was extremely picky. Every single person I looked at with a fine tooth comb. I didn’t wanna introduce anyone to my kids or get it wrong again. 

I meet this guy. He’s perfect , he wanted a family , had been burned like me. A mutual friend set us up. He and I waited 8 months before meeting each other’s kids. 

We take things slow. The sex was amazing , he listened to me for hours and I did to him. We never had 1 single fight. 


We 1 year into it , we have our first fight. Over the past 5 years we have had little fights here and there .  Some huge fights where I saw a different side of him. He goes into a spiral of sending me 1000 text messages . Saying my behavior causes him to yell and slam doors and I do not take accountability for my behaviors and I stonewall him. 

I get quiet when someone yells to clarify 

We share 5 kids together and 1 is our own . It’s been pretty miserable the past year. We fight almost weekly. we don’t sleep in the same bed anymore. I feel like he always bitches and complains about me or the kids. I realize he’s probably on the spectrum.  He has tics where he clears his throat and sniffles all day long. He has no social skills. He will walk right by people and not speak to them. 

I hate how he behaves and awkward he is. He doesn’t hug the kids or talk to them much unless it’s needed. 

My issue is , I do love him. I’m not in love anymore and honestly some days I struggle to even wanna be around him. 

He’s loyal , honest , works hard and pours his entire finance into me and the kids. He attends every event , ever kid thing , he puts himself last every single time in regards to that. 

He has a level head and thinks very logically and without emotion regarding life issues, where I am way more emotional. 


I’m in a huge custody battle with my ex where we just paid 15k for a lawyer to get updated custody orders in place because my ex is a monster. He operates in malicious ways . He records my children asking them questions about my household , he has seriously caused some serious issues where the kids are refusing to go to his house and I’m trying to encourage them and remain positive and it’s just a mess. 


I’m not dumb to the fact - I would become a single mother of 4 / divorced twice and my life would change entirely. I have no family alive.
I will add me and my husband attend therapy twice a month and sometimes more and while it helps , I still find myself annoyed at him by his lack of emotional connection. . I’m not interested in dating or remarrying and the possibility of finding someone worth a crap in my situation is almost zero to none. 


I just am so unhappy and idk how to turn it back on .

1k8l0lv,Advice Regarding my Parents and My Own Family,Hachuyani2,"I will do my best to explain this post to the best of my ability. I am the eldest son of 4 children.

I am almost 34 years old, my First Sister is 32, my brother is 28 and my youngest sister is 25. My parents are 61(Dad) and 56(Mom).

My first Sister and brother are both Single, brother lives with parents and first sister lives in one of my parents houses *Parents have 3 houses, I am living in one of them*

My youngest sister had a baby girl born on December 30th of 2024 (Toxic Boyfriend situation who isn’t always there for her but she stays with him from time to time and also in First Sister’s house)

I am the only one who is married out of my siblings, my wife is almost 34 as well (we are 3 months apart) and we have a boy Toddler 2yrs 6mo and NEWBORN baby boy born April 6th, 2025. My wife is also from another country(Philippines).

***

Now that the stage is set I’ll begin with my question regarding the background. I love my parents but they have an extreme boomer mindset. As I said before they own 3 houses and a couple other properties, my dad still works and is very well financially, not rich by any means but my mom has a very bougie upper class mindset. 

For some more background, my dad was very poor growing up and my mom didn’t have to worry for much but they were both abused to some degree as children. My dad’s side was more Mental Abuse/Lack of Emotional Support, and my mom’s was a combination of emotional and physical (her dad did things that were not appropriate to do to your daughter, if you can imagine it then you get the idea. It is of a sexual nature, between beating and touching) they have done their very best and I’ve done the same to have mercy and understanding with them.

That being said, when I was young I always had a dream of what I wanted my life to be like. An example of things I had to deal with would be, I had a bed wetting issue years ago and my mom would say things like “you’re too lazy to use the bathroom” and at one point made me sleep in the garage and sent me outside in the snow in a diaper at 11 years old. This particular incident she DID ask forgiveness for and I did forgive her and don’t hold that against her anymore (this is important to reference later) because outside of that she would never apologize for anything.

The next example was the type of wife I wanted. She tried to control every friend and even the type of woman I should be with, to be specific I preferred someone of an Asian Background and culture because I love the family dynamic associated with it, and decided so ever since I was 16. Both her and my dad have even accused me of having Pedo like tendencies because of this (I am 6ft 4in) and I used to be skinny but I grew up to about 250lbs. I also had a failed LDR relationship of 4 years back and forth in the Philippines but eventually met my now wife (different girl but also from the Philippines) and at age 30 I did marry her (2022) and now we have two beautiful children and I got her and my first son here June 7th, 2024 in the USA. I also didn’t mention that I was married to her until after I had already married her.

For even more context, my brother still lives at home with them and all my siblings have jobs, but I digress, in order to get to where I was married I forced myself out of the house right before I turned 30, went into several thousands of dollars worth of debt trying to keep my own apartment, I managed for about 15 months and would have been fine, didn’t talk to my parents for about a year but they called me and offered me one of their houses as a very very good deal ($725 mortgage) and for the sake of my family I took the deal. 

You can shame me and that is fine, I am a FedEx Driver making approximately 41-46k a year but I still struggle to take care of my family. I know most people may say to just deal with the parents since they have helped me financially now with this house (it’s a 3bd 1ba on 2.5 acres 900sq ft), but my mother literally tries to control everything I do. She has disrespected my wife and whilst she does enjoy seeing my toddler, I gave her a chance to see our newborn but on her first meeting she was too worried about his clothes and how they weren’t the ones she bought for him. (The inner clothes were but the jacket was from my wife’s mom) and now she keeps trying to feed my newborn water which she adds to goat milk and also trying to give him apple juice. She has only watched him for 5 days (we would take him for 4-6 hours in the evening) but she insisted on watching him even though my wife and I were managing just fine albeit very tired.

My youngest sister allowed them to watch her baby for 2 weeks but then removed her because they wouldn’t follow her rules.

I know most people are going to probably see the financial side of this, but I enjoy spending time with my family, I only work about 25-30 hours a week, I am also trying to homestead for the health of my family, chickens, goats, etc. it’s a lot of work and they both shame me for it but I want the best for my family.

My question would be this. Should I cut them off entirely and start a new life?

I am at a crossroads where I almost want to forsake the house and move into our own new place even if it means more financial struggle, I could go into more detail about my mom as she is extremely controlling and always has been but she believes the financial help entitles her to control nearly every aspect of my life. This post doesn’t have anywhere near the detail but I figured I’d start with this.",1,0,1745695582.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k8l0lv/advice_regarding_my_parents_and_my_own_family/

1k8e6vm,Lashed out at my sister because shes always shut me down.,FeedMeLenny,"So I have known my sister since I was a little boy. She pretty much raised me growing and ive always looked up to her. She has always done great in school and has gotten her masters. She is a good person. My mom isnt from America so her English isnt the best but she isnt the quickest minded in arguments, but she always defaults to seeing my sister out if we've had a major altercation around her. my father is no present. The case is that I have really bad submechaniphobia and Ive always had it growing up. Its only gotten worse, to the point where I wake up in cold sweats from nightmares involving my fear. So I woke up this morning with this exact problem, and I rush to my living room since my phobia gets pretty bad when im alone so I seek the comfort of my mom and sister. They heard me yell and asked if I was okay and I tell them that I had a nightmare involving my fear and my sister says ""I think you were on the titanic in a past life"", like that could be an actual explanation. She is not joking she genuinely would count that in as a possibility. Shes believes heavily in astrology so I guess that gives you an idea. but anyways I dont go against her saying that even if I dont agree with that because I know I will get told that ""your always so negative, you dont believe in anything"" etc. So I mention that I should seek therapy for this soon since this has been affecting me my whole life and has only gotten somewhat worse with time. Ive done research into how exposure therapy for phobias work and that pretty much being the only way to overcome it, you have to expose yourself to it. My sister says ""You dont need a therapist, My therapist is chatGPT, his name is Gibby"". I tell her that the AI is just going to essentially google search how to overcome phobias, which ive already done before, but she snarkily tells me that you don't know that and starts to ask chatGPT how to help me. It pretty much lists exactly what exposure therapy is stating ""Start really small, and slowly expose yourself to your phobia with time and try to understand it"". I dismiss her telling her thats exactly what exposure therapy is and that Id like an actual therapist to walk me through the process. We start getting upset at eachother because of my dismissal of the AI and she decides to stop and tell me that im stubborn for not hearing her bot out all the way, even when I already told her what it was going to say. She gets a really pissy attitude because of that fact, and for me wanting to see a real therapist. On that note she has also been  very stubborn growing up, if you have an objecting opinion against her she will get upset and claim in my case that I'm always just negative. Even when something is a fact, like (really quick detour) we saw a bug that flew up to our 18th floor apartment window, she said it was a tick but ticks dont have wings. and the bug clearly had a set of wings and flew away. She never believed me and shrugged it off as ""im always trying to be right"". Its just so condescending, but back to the original argument. We just got more and more heated and I didnt want to hear her describe to me why I didnt need a therapist because of some stupid AI, So we got louder and louder to the point we were pretty much yelling with our chest at eachother. And I got too heated to the point where I stood up and stood right above her on the couch screaming and putting my hand around her wrist. I didnt want to physically touch her but she was insistent, on saying that ""Im being a stubborn fucking asshole"" and constantly trying to shut down anything I say. I let go and my mom got in between us pleading that we stop, she pleaded mainly for me to stop, telling my sister ""hes like this, he will never stop until you stop"". Which I will admit in a way was true for me, but so is the same for my sister, and she always wants to have the last word, or be upset that you oppose her. I stopped because my mom didnt want to deal with use arguing and I went to my room. This is not the first time Ive had an argument this bad with my sister and only my sister. I dont want to argue with her like this, I care for her and my family. thing is now because I got so upset for the first time I put my hands on her, I seem like the bad person in this. Now I am alone in my room, and my mom stayed with my sister and they are laughing and hanging around. I get so sad knowing that in the back of their minds, even my moms. \*I\* am the problem. Not my sister, only me. and they dont need to change anything about the way they act, only me. slowly Ill keep getting shrugged off as the person who argues over everything even when its for things as dumb as that. and it makes me feel so alone, not matter how much id describe my side of anything to my mom, im the problem. I dont know what else to say but I wish we had some sortve of counselor to view this from the outside and examine these situations so things can change, whether it be from me or sister. Or both. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated if you've read this far.",2,1,1745677625.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k8e6vm/lashed_out_at_my_sister_because_shes_always_shut/
1k8ciht,I deserve respect. And could use some emotional support about it...,UnevenFork,"I (32F) am not afraid to cut off family members. When someone starts consistently doing more harm than good in my life, *especially* if avoidable hurtful behaviour remains unchanged after confrontation, I'm done. Out. I ain't got time for that.

I've got a *big* family and grew up close to most of them. These days, I talk to none of them except my younger brother (24M) and mom. With aunts/uncles/cousins, it was just the slow disconnect that I realized was a good thing when my life got more peaceful. Narcissistic paternal grandmother got the boot, my golden child of a father went next, and my princess of a younger sister came after that. A handful of years between each cut. And now, my baby brother is on the chopping block and I'm absolutely heartbroken because it isn't going well... Here's what happened yesterday.

My brother sent me a meme video. I was actually excited. We're civil and get along, but only really hang out as a group with mom and my bf for board game nights. Which I always thought was pretty cute and as much as I needed, but YAY let's throw memes into the mix!

The video was ""nominating"" me to get my driver's license. I have epilepsy. He knows that I don't have a driver's license for a pretty damn good reason. I haven't flopped for some involuntary breakdancing in a few years (hooray for that), but I do still have occasional focal seizures. And the way they sneak up out of nowhere, I simply wouldn't feel responsible or safe behind the wheel.

I should also mention about him ""knowing"" I have a damn good reason... When I was first diagnosed, my brother and mom secretly questioned my boyfriend, asking the man who's held my convulsing body on several occasions, whether or not I was faking it. I honestly don't know why I let that incident slide... It endlessly bothers me that they think so little of me. That they think I would lie about that.

Anyways, when I watched the little ""nomination"" clip, I got enraged. And devastated. A swirl of negative emotions that definitely had me crying the more I thought about how he just straight up overlooked my entire disability and everything I fucking struggle with. Yeah, haha, she can't drive. So funny how she needs a ride to work or to get groceries or any kind of appointment. So funny how she can't function independently. Point and laugh. 

I messaged some friends about it and they made me feel sane about being angry... my family likes to say I'm sensitive or over dramatic, but adulthood slowly showed me that I'm just a human with normal emotions and expressing those emotions makes my family uncomfortable. It's a really fun dynamic... Anyways, after messaging friends, I sat with my feelings for a bit to let me process a minute and get a level head. Once there, I wrote my response in my memos and sat on that a bit. Edited once or twice. I wanted it to almost be an emotionless expression of my hurt feelings. My sadness or anger weren't going to be in the driver's seat this time.

It basically said that while I know that was supposed to be funny, it hurt my feelings and I feel like my struggles were overlooked for a cheap laugh at my expense. *I waited 3 hours to send it*

Through those 3 hours, I had an absolute meltdown while overthinking. My precious baby brother has become quite the gymbro over the past few years, and I was terrified that it'd gone past the muscles and into the personality... Actually, I knew it already had. Recently learned he doesn't fucking respect women, which made me overthink more. I was ranting to friends (who I love for letting me talk their ears off yesterday) that I was petrified of him responding ""you're too sensitive.""

Sent that shit on the 3 hour mark, and maybe 20 minutes later I got the reply, ""it's not that deep.""

I messaged back ""...yes, it is"" and completely fucking broke down. Not only did he hurt my feelings, but he didn't care. Like, at all. I don't even care about the video anymore. I care that he didn't care to apologize. He hasn't sent a message back yet, and it's been almost 20 hours. I don't think he's going to.

I'm contemplating messaging him again, but I'm not sure how to do it without making a bigger mess. I just want to ask why he doesn't seem to care that he genuinely hurt my feelings yesterday. It's not about how big of a deal *he* thinks it is. He wasn't the one targeted by the joke... The lack of empathy is so fucked.

And I feel guilty, too. I feel like it's my fault he ended up this way. When I moved for college, our communication got a lot less. I should have kept it up even with everything else happening in my life. I should have been a better big sister to help him make better choices and friends... Because I fuckin know our family wouldn't have taught him anything fucking useful. They're emotionally fucking stupid and nasty and lack empathy and tact and... Jesus Christ I'm just so mad at everything.

I don't know what to do. My bf is super mad, which also sucks because he and my brother are pretty close... We had a brother who died just before my bf came into the picture, and my bf kind of effortlessly became that big brother influence that we had lost. And my bf is ready to completely drop him for my sake. I love that I have a man who would do that. Who actually puts me first. But I hate that it's going to steal something so necessary from my brother.

It's *going to*. I have no doubts after yesterday... My baby brother has turned into everything he always claimed to hate. I don't want to compare him to our fucking dad, but God damn it... 

Mkay, now I'm crying so I'm gonna stop or else this is gonna become gibberish. Thanks for letting me rant this morning.",4,2,1745672767.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k8ciht/i_deserve_respect_and_could_use_some_emotional/

he has always misbehaved and has got into trouble with the police before however after this he had calmed down but all of a sudden since last year he has started to steal money from us including from out wallets or even taking our credit cards as be has figured out pin codes and passwords ( we have changed them mutliple times but he still keeps getting them) he will steal it and then refuse to acknowledge he has done this when it is very clear it is him, he even tries to blame me which thankfully my parents both know i am in full time education and when i arrive home at from school i am downstairs helping out. 

this might seem like a petty issue but he steals food and i don’t mean oh he ate my snacks i mean he will steal other peoples meals and drinks even from their own room , this might seem petty but he will rummage  through peoples rooms and their stuff and take it ( forgot to mention i have 3 brothers ) from my other brothers and me but he never takes accountability or says sorry. he laughs and says he never did it . which imo is a huge boundary, we have hidden things and he will try and find it that same day. bare in mind it is stuff we earn with our hard earned money

My older brothers are really great brothers and we all have a good relationship and talk and share things and when he steals their stuff they will yell and try to get closure but they get greeted with the same laugh and that he never did that. our parents have tried , he doesnt take my mother seriously which really gets to me as she has sacrificed everything for us even putting up with a cheating emotionally abuse husband just so we were supported and he still has no respect for any of us. 

the main reason i want help is because recently it has been making me really upset and angry , i dont want to sound like im complaining but i am under lots of stress and when i come home i am just even more stressed , i have really bad migraines due to stress and even have flare ups of stress where my body shuts down and i can hardly move. He is stressing me out and making me angry to the point i am shaking with anger but so upset i burst into tears and just want to hit things or even harm myself

He always makes me feel awkward even when I'm on my own, will never speak if someone has come over and will bang around in his room.

I've not had friend over the last several months due to this. 

A week ago we had an argument about his girlfriend staying over every weekend and he told me I was power tripping. Even when he initially brought  her over, he never introduced her to me went straight to his room where they stayed up for hours giggling and messing around (despite knowing I had work the following day). The following day he acted as though nothing had happened.

This week, my new boyfriend stayed over a couple of days. Despite  his girlfriend said hello my son ignored him.

1k842tg,I would like to know if anyone has experienced something like this.,EmbarrassedAct7768,"English is not my first language and this text was automatically translated, so I apologize for any mistakes.

I'm 1x years old. My father has made me feel like crap my whole life. He thinks he's superior, to the point of judging people by their appearance, saying they were things of the ""threshold"" (umbral in portuguese) and harmful remnants of past lives. My father didn't seem to feel ""negative"" emotions either, making them seem inferior. My parents separated and when my father left home it was a relief, because I finally realized that this wasn't normal.

Later I started to visit his house too. He would often fight with me over the smallest things and would play the victim. He made some mistakes by buying a very expensive apartment and blamed me for it. He started to blame me for his own unhappiness. One day he took me to the movies with my friend and I didn't want him to sit with us to eat. He got mad at me and fought with me the whole way home. I was crying and shaking when I got home, and I tried to ask my mom to pick me up. He took my phone away from me and called my mom to tell her that I was throwing a tantrum and treating him badly.

This went on for a long time. I even tried to kill myself a few times because of him. My mother made me go to therapy. The only thing the therapist said was to put me in his shoes and that he was suffering. None of this was enough to keep me away from him. We still argued a lot.

Recently he started treating me like a child. He keeps kissing me, it's repulsive. I feel like I'm going to vomit, but the acid doesn't come up. I feel disgusted by him.

Today he fought with me over an umbrella. I freaked out. I started yelling at him back saying that I hated him and didn't want to see him. He told me to give him reasons, so I complained about everything he did. He called me a liar.

I'm not leaving there until he physically attacks me, according to some people in justice or whatever

My friend said my dad must be a narcissist or something, but I'm not sure.

1k82uwk,"I am hurt my by younger brother, how do I address this?",AGirlInDeepThoughts,"Hi everyone, I want to start my first apologizing- I am processing my feelings and at times accurately expressing my feelings, thoughts and ideas can be challenging and it can come across as unclear. 

I am a 29 year old female, I have a younger brother who just turned 21. We have quite an age gap and at times, due to this we have not always had a common understanding- we’re very different people and in different stages of life. I am settled in a home with my fiancé, a career, and quite sure of myself as a person. My brother is just learning himself and beginning adulthood and getting his feet in the  door and working and thinking about what he wants to do with his life. 

I’ve always been a quiet, soft spoken, and sensitive sister. I am cautious, and very thoughtful about how I address people, and understand the power words have in conversation. My brother on the other hand at times is not as calculated as I when in conversation with others, which from my perspective comes off as brash, and at times quite careless. 

Today, my immediate family came to the house my fiancé and I purchased a few months back. My brother, mom, and other family came. My brother brought his little dog, (this is important to the story). It’s our fist home and a family member who flew in from our home wanted to visit and see the home my fiancé and I were building. My brother suggested we all go to a restaurant- have a meal together instead of purchasing a pizza from a near by location and calling that dinner. After some suggestions being tossed out- we went along with what my brother suggested. My fiancé was not with us- he was unfortunately stuck at work and was unable to dine with us. 

While out at the restaurant, I am sitting with family and it’s a self serve restaurant- one I haven’t been to in many years. I have quite a severe anxiety disorder and get very easy overwhelmed in new environments, so for me- having hold of someone’s arm for me is very calming and keeps me feeling emotionally regulated. Holding someone’s arm for me is quite important to the story. If I become too overwhelmed, anxiety attacks are quite common and thankfully haven’t had a severe one in a few months.

Anyways, my brother had just gotten another tattoo in the arm- quite a large one in fact. Again, this is important to the story as well. Walking around the restaurant- and feeling overwhelmed at it being a new environment and things being quite unfamiliar to a certain extent. Out of habit, I cling to my brothers arm for the emotional support, and mistakenly I lightly touch his arm he had just tattooed. Publicly in the restaurant, he snapped at me. LOUDLY! Truly- I’ve never been so speechless at how effortlessly and naturally it felt for him to snap at me and speak to me so disrespectfully- especially in a public place with our family. 

He has a long history of saying hurtful things to me; I am quite emotionally sensitive. He has a history of coming to the home my fiancé and I have created and been disrespectful. On a previous visit- his dog destroyed the carpet in the guest bedroom. Luckily- I was able to fix it. He apologized and offered to pay for the repair if we ever decided to have it repaired or replaced. Well, today, it happened again. His little dog destroyed the carpet in our master bedroom! I had to excuse myself and cry it out again after our “situation” at the restaurant. He didn’t apologize for this one. He never apologized for snapping at me at the restaurant. 

Many times, I’ve felt hurt but endured it- because he’s my younger brother and I love him. Today, it feels different- my heart is feeling so much sadness and break. How can I address that I am hurt, and establish ground rules for visiting without coming across as disrespectful? I am so upset- I am feeling like I need to ask he not come to our home if he is going to continue hurting me emotionally and being disrespectful. Am I wrong for this?

I'm 17, and I've never had a stable relationship with my mother. I'm going to try to explain myself as best I can. As long as I can remember my mother has always been abusive, I still remember when I was just a kid and she used to grab me by my fucking hair and drag me almost all over the house and shake me like a dirty rag, she would ridicule me in front of others with subliminal comments of whatever she considered I had done wrong, sometimes she would order my stepdad to hit me. I often went back and forth between my mom's house and my grandma's house since my grandma was literally the only one who never hit me, she never raised her voice at me when I did something wrong, she was my safe place, but despite everything I was still just a kid who loved her mom. When I was a teenager she no longer hit me, but that physical abuse turned into verbal and emotional abuse. It was so bad that I tried to commit suicide. And when I was 12 I finally moved in with my grandmother permanently. I literally ran away from my parents' house, and since their house was close to my grandmother's house, it didn't cost me much to simply leave. I'm not saying my mom didn't do good things for me. But I feel like if we were to weigh the good and bad things that the bad side did to me, the bad side would win. If it were up to me, I would tell her all the shit and hell she put me through, and I would cut ties with her, but... the problem is my sister. She is still in elementary school and she's not to blame for what happened between my mom and me. And I know that if I cut ties with my mom, I'd also cut ties with my sister. And then my sister wouldn't have anyone if she ever needed help or wanted to leave my parents. I'm between a rock and a hard place. And I have no idea what to do.

1k7vlbu,how do I talk to my older sister again?,Emotional-Gur-9889,"I'm 18 years old, and my sister is 20 years old, and in the past, she used to be like, kinda mean towards me a lot.

it's probably that average older sister things. However 

she used to order me around and get her things around the house/make me do whatever she asked.

whenever I didn't, she'd say that she hated me and wish I was never born and how I was the worst.

she used to hit me a lot, make me cry and stuff

idk if this is an older sister thing also, but she used to take me to my grandmother's room when no one was looking and practicing on me

shed dry hump me and kiss me because she was in the 4th-6th grade and liked boys at that age

I used to attempt to push her off and cry, but she'd hit me and tell me to be quiet

this went on for a while 

if we were in the pool together, she'd flash me with her chest and brag about how her chest was bigger than mine since she had gone through puberty 

try to make me show my chest (I was like 10-11 ish and would move away from her and tell her no and she'd make fun of me and say I had a smaller chest and just didn't wanna show mine

if I got out of the shower, she'd be in the hallway trying to yank off my towel and corner me.

she grew a big butt so she'd try to tweak or grind on me. She thought it was funny, but I'd get uncomfortable and frustrated and mad

she'd get mad too since I wasn't going along with it.

later on in middle school when she found out I had been self harming 

she started crying and saying how I had it easy and my life wasn't hard

(mind you, we both lived in an abusive household) 

she threatened to hit me and tell my parents 

then when I was 14-15 when i had run away from home because I thought I was trans (ftm) and didn't feel safe to cut my hair and come out

I eventually came back home and got in trouble ofc

but when my sister found out, she'd sarcastically tell people ""oh SHE goes by ________ now,"" and laugh at it

or she told me how I should've run away longer so she didn't have to go to school or deal with me

then she'd bodyshame me as a joke sometimes

or just act weird around me like I was some weird freak

I know all of this could just be older sister things that they do

but I got slowly tired of her
she made me feel so horrible constantly.

so I just stopped talking to her, and when I did talk to her

I pretended I was talking to a brick wall and responded in short responses with a dry tone.

we still lived in the same house and family, but we sorta acted like strangers to each other.

we've been like that since 2020-2025 now

andddd well, idk if my older sister has changed fully, but she's nice to my little siblings.

I feel like she's somewhat the same(ish), but not like how she was before when we were kids

I wanna say she's matured?? 

but I don't know.

I kinda feel bad for ingoring and acting like she doesn't exist.

I know we were both kids in a bad home at the time, and she was probably just hurt, but idk

like I feel bad for her

but she kind of hurt me growing up

And I know she'd pretend that the stuff she did to me as a child never happened, and I know I'll never get an apology from her ever.

I think that's what holding me back from wanting to talk to her.

1k7v1fg,please give me advice so i can make amends with my mother,m0ney_bagg,"hi everyone, i’m a 17 year old bengali muslim F. i know my culture is already conservative, but i was born and raised in the U.S., so my lifestyle isn’t insanely strict but its there. i work part time twice a week, i have a 4.0 GPA, and i usually do what i’m told. yeah, sometimes i mess up or push back a little, but i try my best.

my mom doesn’t like that i work, doesn’t like that i study a lot, doesn’t like when i go out with friends. she’s a homebody and wants me to live that way too, but it makes me feel miserable. i enjoy being outside, i like being with people or even just alone in fresh air. but she hates that.

i’ve always felt like she didn’t love me. maybe people will say that’s “tough love” but it never feels like love, just yelling and guilt. when we’re out, everything depends on her mood. if one small thing annoys her, the whole outing is ruined. even things like me asking to go on a walk gets shut down for no reason—and our neighborhood is safe.

i’ve tried talking to her, even cried about it, but she always makes it about culture and how i’m disrespecting her. every convo ends in her being mad at me for days. she always thinks she’s right and never tries to see my side. then days go by where she’s cold, and then there are the days where she interacts with me normally, it’s very fluctuating.

today broke me. she doesn’t like when i have my phone while i eat, and i had it out because i was watching youtube. she told me to hand it over, and i said “please can i have it back after i eat, i need it for my work.” i apologized and tried to keep calm, but she exploded. she swore at me, told me she regrets raising me and wishes i wasn’t her daughter. then she took the airpods i bought with my own money and threw them somewhere, i still have yet to find them.

i don’t know what i’m doing wrong but im open to any criticism on my end, im sure there are things im doing wrong for her to act this way. i don’t know how much longer i can keep living like this. i know i probably can’t move out unless i get married, if i try to before then id get disowned. i just want my mom, i want maternal love and support. if anyone has been through this or has advice, please help. i’m tired.",1,1,1745612998.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k7v1fg/please_give_me_advice_so_i_can_make_amends_with/
1k7us0w,My sister is having her 5th baby that she hid the pregnancy for 36 weeks(35 year old single mom addict),Disastrous_Major_828,"so lets start with background me and my older sister are products of divorce my mom left us when we were 11and 14 and at one point my dad made the choice to move to a different state naturally we wanted to stay in the same state so we chose to move in with our mom who by the way was already moved in with a new boyfriend. she dedicated all her time to work and boyfriend and partying. me and my sister have no guidance and chose the wrong path and followed our mother. we starting doing drugs and sex very young. dad didn't notice till it was too late. he was trying to provide. so my sister fell into hard core addiction. never holding a job living off the government and now. years later she is having her 5th baby. she hid the pregnancy for 36 weeks (she hides her pregnancy everytime ) and now is expecting my parents to fix everything which is what my moms doing. she just bought the baby everything he needs. and now my mom is mad at me and my dad for not being happy or supportive of this oncoming baby. i mean i never got along with my sister anyways and now im supposed to be loving and supporting. NOT too mention my dad and his wife are raising my sisters 4th child, a 5 year old gurl. they walked into her house and saw how disturbing it was and just took the girl. and my sister just never went to pick her up. im  tired of people telling me to accept the baby because its coming and to be nice. when i got pregnant my mom yelled at me to get an abortion and was not supportive at all. i got my tubes tied and 21 because my mom said she would never talk to me again if i didn't. my mom drinks several drinks every night and has too much anxiety to even visit me an hour away because she is afraid to drive. but yet she is wanting me to override my feelings. 


how can i organize all these feelings and put them away. im so tired of my sister she has lost all her teeth and even lost her dentures. she is constantly getting saved by my mom. she claims the kids on her taxes and pays her bills and pays for the kids since my sister wont work. she is pissed because my dad doesnt want to fix my sister car because she ""needs"" it for the baby. why didnt she get a job then????? im sooo pissed. im trying to figure out if i even want to be a part of my moms life right now. am i wrong.? Do i be supportive or just stay away from the whole sitution? my mom keeps calling me about the baby and wanting to show me a the cute stuff but i'm just sick to my stomach. 

PS 
The court order my sister to attend a drug court(kind of like rehab through the state) classes everyday and has to blow and do urine test. so she has been sober for a couple months. she still hid this pregnancy and could've been more proactive.

1k7uefx,Am I The Scapegoat?,IcyDream4100,"I've recently remembered the term Scapegoat while just thinking about how family treats me, and i think I could be, but I also am a little unsure. So to reddit! 

I've always been the golden child until I was like 11 or 12, academically lifted, artistically talented stuff like that. Only thing they hated about me was our differing political/social views. My brother was just the classic rebellious type, and a bit abusive towards me. They liked everything about him other than his carelessness. So nearly exact opposite, ironic. 

Growing up anytime any abuse occurred he was not punished. I would be lectured for ""telling other people our family business"" or threatened. Anytime I was angry I would be mocked or threatened, while my brother could break things and scream with nothing said. Even when i was sad or crying it was treated as an issue. Still, they would talk highly of me to others, let me see friends, buy me gifts here and there, etc. So it was hard to understand if they liked me or hated me. 

Eventually I've noticed how many times I get blamed for everything, or expected to do everything including cleaning up for everyone else. (Having to wash my brothers clothes, fold them AND put them away in his drawers pisses me off, hes a grown adult) Missed school because your brother promised to take you and he didn't? My fault. We have bugs in the house? My fault. House is a mess? (I stay in my room). My fault. Animals have fleas? My fault. 

It's confusing for me even now because they treat me like they don't care for me, then they turn around and brag about me. They still let me do mostly whatever I want (not as much as my brother has gotten away with however) and rarely actually punish me.
 Figuring out my dynamic in this confusing family will definitely help explain to my family why I'm NEVER talking to those people again after I finish college, and maybe even help in therapy.

1k7rc0x,help! AITA for saying to my partner that I do not feel that he really consider me and my child his family after he said we are his family and his priority?,Cardiologist5769,"
Context:

I have a preschooler from previous marriage and just recently given birth to my  youngest with my current partner. 

He asked me whether it will be fine with me if we can move closer to where his sibling and SIL lives. I said it’s okay as long as there will be boundaries. 
He did not take this lightly and said why, I said most of your decisions and opinions are navigated by his family. He said you are my family now, then I said prove it. 

Whenever I say something about how to take care of newborn l, etc. he would negate it. But if the same opinion is given by his SIL, he does accept it. 
He is always on call with them during my delivery, when my baby ended up in NICU etc. 

My partner is a good person but he just stopped becoming a partner right after I gave birth.              He never asked me how I was after delivery, well he posted telling the world I did a great job with the delivery.m but that’s it. 
I was vomiting after delivery he did not even assist me or ask me if he can help me in any way. 
He just wanted to carry the baby all the time. I have stitches, struggling to walk, but all he wanted was to sit, carry the baby and feed the baby. He would ask me to go the end of the hallway where the feeding supplies are and make our baby her milk. 

Since I have given birth, my partner never trusted me on bathing our child, but he does with his SIL, it was so annoying that in my daughter’s first bath at home, he told her to bathe my baby instead of us doing it. Imagine how chaotic 6 arms and hands moving around to wash a wee baby. 

everything that is happening on pregnancy and delivery is reported to his family. Even my struggle with producing breastmilk. 

2 days after being discharged from the hospital, he allowed his family and their friends to visit despite me telling to delay the visit as we have not settled at home yet, I am still in pain and uncomfortable. 
When they arrived to stay at home overnight, his SIL took the baby off my arms without asking, and said to me “go and sleep”. I mean I do appreciate that maybe she wants to help but man the delivery is just annoying. 
No one in his family or friends that came in that day asked me once if I am okay or how I feel. 

Then when we were sitting in the lounge my partner’s SIL told me, I can breastfeed your baby, I still have plenty of supply anyway (my partner told them that I do not have milk supply yet).
The next morning I woke up and found the baby is not in my room. My partner took the baby and let them pass the baby around. Then SIL said to me at lunch, hey you know that your baby is so unsettled this morning so I placed her on my breast. 
I am unsure whether she actually made my baby latch on her. Which is starting to infuriate me, but I ignored this to not cause a scene. 

I was deeply offended by the breastfeeding part because in the first place breastfeeding is personal and intimate, that should be shared between a mother and a child. I do get that sometimes others struggle and breastmilk can be donated but it was the actual latching and making the baby settle on other person’s chest. I am just in my room. How difficult was it to bring her back to my room or call me to settle my baby?

I was analysing the situation, thinking maybe SIL was just trying to be funny. But then I was thinking to myself that how can this fly with my partner, if it was me making jokes about something he would call me out but if it is his family, then it’s okay.

How can I best be there for my nephew who’s 15yo and addicted to weed.  

He stopped dreaming of a future and quit school. He doesn’t have a real job and I don’t know who’s getting his drugs for him.  I live miles away and can’t go home as often as I want but I try to show my family what life could be like if they want a way out of the reservation. 

He doesn’t listen to his mom who does everything she can, but she is raising a toddler and a kindergartener.  She tries but she’s raising them on her own. 

She’s asked the ministry for help with her teenager — they threatened to take away her two younger ones instead.  

She’s called the cops a couple of times. No real help at all. 

She feels all alone

Before you make uneducated assumptions of life on a Native American reservation—Canada is very different than the USA reserves.

1k7oyqy,Me and my brothers argument,Sudden_Win9398,"Me: male and my brother recently had an argument on where a chair was placed. The context was that I wanted him to use his chair to game on my desk because my chair had stuff like my football kit on it. It all stemmed from when he went to to sleep and was watching a TikTok video, when I told him to put his chair back and to bring put my chair back infront of my desk, the words I used were “put my chair back now” and he said wait then I repeated myself and he got mad at me and started screaming. 
My point was: since his chair was in my vicinity and he had a responsibility to put my chair back and move his chair he should’ve done it when I said so since I was in authority
His point: was that since he said wait I had to wait (he has a history of doing this and never doing the task, if u don’t believe me he still hasn’t changed the bin he was supposed to do last week cause he said wait)
Also another thing was on emotional maturity 
My point was: someone emotionally mature is able to stay calm when he is needed to
His point was: humans express emotions and he’s allowed to scream at me 
Also after his tirade he finally let me speak in which I said “listen I’m trying to understand how you could be frustrated because of how hyper fixated u were on my video (I slipped in and said that’s a sign of autism)” and he didn’t even try to here me out he ran and started screaming and attacking me so I started screaming saying I won’t fight back because I was wrong for saying that, (btw I admitted fault around 7 times during the argument and said sorry whilst he didn’t even try to) ",1,0,1745597886.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k7oyqy/me_and_my_brothers_argument/
1k7nio1,Family Destroying House,Intelligent_Ad7704,"Posting this with a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

About twenty years ago, my estranged father passed away and left me some money. I used it to buy myself a house and a house for my mother and disabled sister to live in. At some point, my brother moved back in with my mother as well. She’s always had hoarding tendencies, but over the last decade, things have gotten worse. We’ve fought over the state of the house several times. 

In the last couple of years, I found out there’s a rodent problem that they won’t do anything about. Now, most people find mice to be gross, but I actually have a severe phobia of them. It’s my single biggest OCD trigger. The problem is apparently so bad that my brother catches them and collects them in mason jars as “specimens.” At this point, I can’t even be around my family without feeling contaminated. I’ve held back sharing the extent of my disgust while my grandma was alive because we always went to her house for holidays. She passed away in January and ever since, I’ve been having panic attacks at the thought of having them over for the holidays. 

I can’t do it anymore. I’m ready to tell my mom how I feel, but I’m conflicted on how far I should take it. Some of my friends think I should have them evicted. At this point, it’s just her and my brother as our disabled sister passed away during Covid. I don’t know about eviction, but I know that I can’t be around them anymore until they clean up their lifestyle.

1k7mes8,"My Grandma is crazy, but I want us to get along.",feeling_froggie,"I (24 F), my partner (26 M) and our son (1 M) have moved into my grandparents house this year to save up lots and lots of money. It had been going well, and because I stay home and don't have a job I help them with ALL household chores. I am kind and babysit for them because they watch the whole family's kids on and off throughout the week, I have essentially taken on all of their roles so they can have a break.Happily! My grandmother is still working, her husband is retired, and everyone in my family knows there is something wrong with her.
It takes nothing to offend her, it really is like she just wants something to be offended by. The other night she was upset because in front of my aunt, her eldest daughter, (also the only one in our family to graduate college) she said she had a 'pen fetish'. I was trying to be funny, and said ""you have a WHAT?"" but it was all in good fun. She didn't speak to me for 3 hours. When I confronted her, she said ""it's okay, I'm used to being disrespected, go ahead and mock me, I'm just waiting to die."" It usually takes about 45 minutes to reassure her and apologize because she just won't accept it. This kind of thing happens AT LEAST once a week.
Fast forward to yesterday, she hadn't spoken to me in about a day and a half, and was being very stand offish. I came downstairs and asked her if I had done anything to upset her. She said no, that she was just ""stressed beyond belief"" and when I asked why, she said she had a friend who she wanted to be able to offer a room but couldn't because we were there. I asked her if she wanted us to go earlier than the year mark she had agreed to, and she said she was thinking the 6 month mark. She tells me this 10 days from May. So I just said okay, and went to my sister's for the day. Very frustrated but still trying to make things work, I come home and try to talk to her about the situation, tell her I love you, I was suprised you said you want us to go by the end of June but if that's what you need it's okay, I want to have a good relationship with you, etc, etc. She said, ""You only ever talk to me like this in front of my husband, you're just trying to make yourself seem sweet to him."" 
?????????????
I was so shocked. I still talked to her for an hour while she interrupted me repeatedly, but I'm still very disturbed and grossed out by the comment. We're going to move out in June, but regardless I'm still sad because I want a good relationship with her, and I don't feel I've done anything to warrant that kind of behavior from her. She also complained in the same breath that her boss let's a coworker slide because he ""likes her tits"" so...

1k7ir30,Cut off contact with toxic brother and sister in law,AsparagusPlastic3442,"First off, I am a little unsure of proper reddit etiquette in terms of structure or special tags so you’ll have to excuse any errors I make. 
 
TLDR
Older stepbrother/former best friend
Suddenly ghosted me for years , attempted to hit on my wife, later tried to claim it was my fault he never replies to messages,  3 years since I cut all contact. 
 
This is a long one so I will try to keep it as short as possible. 
The older stepbrother in this story we will call Chad. 
Chad and I were super close through my teenage years and into my 20s, we would game together regularly and to be blunt he was more like my best friend. 

So much so that in my mid 20s, we ended up as neighbours for years with us renting a unit each in a duplex ( 2 separate units) 
We got along great for years with Chad and his partner (we will call her Jude) and myself and my now wife (let’s call her Mary) 

Anyway after a few years Chad and his partner were ready to buy their first home and moved away, we were a little sad to see them go but also happy for them. However about 6 months before they moved Mary and I started to notice they were distancing themselves from us. 
Chad would arrive home from work and would avoid speaking to us, would no longer message to meet online for a game etc. 

Then after they moved into their new house we very rarely heard from them or saw them. 
On top of this, Chad would only reply to a message every month or two with minimal effort. 
However whenever a sibling would message him (tested several times) they would get a response in minutes. 

Now here where things really start to get interesting, one day Mary and I were sitting down together at home when Chad messages Mary, he’s starts along the lines of saying he had a dream about her, that it was a good dream but when questioned to its contents he says he can’t say as he might get in trouble.
Long story short, it was a round about way to test whether my wife was receptive to his flirting. 
Several close friends have seen the messages and all have confirmed it was obviously a sleazy attempt carefully laced with plausible deniability.

Here’s the thing about Chad though, he’s had 3 different affairs in the last decade without his partner leaving him, and it’s well known that he’s far from loyal.
I probably should have been angry, or reacted in some way.
But a part of me wondered if Chad was attempting to spark a reaction from me. Other than sharing this incident with the rest of the family in our immediate circle, we chose to just carry on as normal ( with screenshots of course just in case)

From this moment however I started changing my approach, I stopped sending a message every few weeks or so, but would still send an occasional message through in order to maintain my ability to be able to say that I at least tried to offer an olive branch to whatever his problem was.

Overtime it just became small updates on things we had a shared interest in.
Like when I was given 2 gaming computers to play around with, I messaged him and blatantly mentioned how I had enough parts to build 2 running computers… ( no interest or response)
So the second computer was given to my other close friend who also had an interest in building a gaming computer 

Or when I got a nice new electric guitar and stack amp ( guitarist for over 20 years) pretty much hinting that I was well equipped to jam should Chad get that drum kit I knew he’s been talking about for years( drummer for just as long as I’ve been playing guitar) 

Other wise maybe once a month or so I would send a message just checking in and informing him of what new has been happening, most of the time I wouldn’t get a response but by then it’s what I expected, the main thing was that at a time when the entire family knew the score, I was the only one who could say they tried.

Now to what kicked off the scenario we find ourselves in today, which may be a little anticlimactic.
One of my other siblings invited several family members over for a get together, I had plans at the time so my wife Mary went alone.
While she was there and outside alone, Chad approached her and started a short conversation. 
Chad basically told her that he found it hard to talk to me as I only want to talk about myself,
And largely just a soft attack on my personality and just generally trying to justify the fact he’s ignored any attempt to interact with me for several years at this point ( to the point that the rest of the family all joke with him about not responding even though that’s only the case with myself)  

When my wife got home and filled me in on this I could only laugh and joke with her that he would actually have to respond to a message to continue the conversation passed the starter. 
And after looking at the previous messages I had sent him where I “spoke about myself”
I saw the time I was intending to give him a gaming computer if he had shown interest ( showed zero) 
And the time I mentioned the new guitar, was in the hopes that he would get another drum kit ( had been telling people for years that he was going to get one) 
Then as I started to slowly buy and replace parts on my gaming computer I would send updates as to what I had been learning and reading about as I knew that he would likely start to build his own ( he did, and used my build list to make sure he bought better parts too) 

Anyway, after he had said his piece to my wife Mary, I decided I was done with trying and deleted his contact information. 
It’s been 3 years now with no contact other than token nods at family gatherings hosted by other siblings. Mary and I got Married 2 years ago, Chad and his partner were not invited.
We have a 6 month old son now who Chad and Jude have only met a couple of times in group settings with interactions kept to a minimum.
Jude is largely ignorant of everything however has since stopped bothering to message me, I think she may feel it’s awfully rude for me to not bother replying.
However she has maintained regular attempts to try and gain favour with Mary,  the best she has achieved was a lunch with Mary and my Mother ( which was largely circumstantial as Mary was my non driving mothers transport for the outing).

Sorry again for the novel, as you can see if you have made it this far, my story is a little petty and a long winded way to describe very little. 
But I would love if anyone has some advice or insight.
My entire response to my older brothers side of things has basically been giving him what he wanted to begin with, didn’t want to talk to me, doesn’t have to be worried about that anymore and frankly I think I’m better off without him and his partner in my life.

1k7crn7,My mom died almost a year ago and my dad wants to bring his gf to visit for the one year death-aversery  of mom,AsparagusWrong2728,"So my  59 year old mom died almost a year ago. I am 34. It was an incredibly painful and mentally draining time for everyone in my family. She was in her early 60s, stage four esophageal cancer and passed quick in about two years time. She chose to not do chemo/radiation/ feeding tube. 

I live far from my family so every few months I would come and visit them to create new memories and make sure they knew they were loved. Literally the hardest few years of my life.  From the beginning of all this, my dad made nothing easier, he constantly would put his needs before the family and in so many ways is very childish. I think he has undiagnosed learning disabilities, which is the only way I can try to cope with how disrespectful he is to me and my brothers.  I had to be the adult in a lot of the decisions making and was thinking ahead of when the time came.   

Examples: one of the days I was staying with my parents and my dad and I were going shopping for the urn. He didn’t want my mom to know, so we were looking without her knowing. My dad wanted to leave earlier, and literally interrupted my therapy session, raising his voice that we have to go now. 

The day my mom died, he didn’t have an urn/ funeral home picked out. His way of coping with her death was to go urn shopping at that moment while her body lay there. I had to basically yell at him and say be with your wife, eventually her body won’t be here… I then went outside and called funeral homes to find the cheapest cremation in the area because my parents didn’t save for a damn thing. 

Anyways plenty of more examples there are for sure. 


Fast forward—- she passes away.  My dad meets a new lady friend at thanksgiving at his mom’s house like 3 months later. He called my brother and I  a month after they started dating,  saying he’s sorry for being a shitty dad… he wants to have a relationship with us… he has to move on now, “it’s gods will that he moves on”, a lot of life changes have occurred. I made the joke about it being a female and he’s like ha how’d you guess.   It ended up being this new woman that all the sudden gave him the motivation to try to be in our lives, he was calling me and my brothers asking how we were doing. Super odd for us.  

This didn’t last long and was definitely a phase. It wasn’t maybe 3-4 months after dating he’s becoming increasingly pushy about us meeting her. Saying that she’s amazing and they are more than friends.. and they “won’t do anything until she’s been gone after a year”.  I didn’t care that he found someone. I was annoyed sure, but I didn’t want him to die alone.  It’s the fact that he constantly puts others before his kids. When you try to talk him about my mom’s death, he just talks about how he lost a wife.  He’s always the victim and can’t understand why it would be way to soon for us to talk to her or meet her.  I also could never tell when he’s talking or his gf.. she’s sent texts under his name and it’s just creepy. 


Mostly recently her death anniversary is coming up.  I haven’t talked to him recently because when I do it’s incredibly draining, and always about him.  He doesn’t remember stuff anyways and hasn’t been much of a father besides dna.  Anyways he calls and says he has a proposition , I’m intrigued. He offers to come and visit during and or around my mom’s year death anniversary.  I was like yeah, that would be great. I have a few days off. I assumed it would be just him so I asked.. and he said the gf would be coming too— but just as support. She’d keep herself busy on those days and she doesn’t have to meet me.  This doesn’t sit well and I told him I would have to think about if. A few minutes later he calls back and says we need to clear some things up.. my gf is here and she wants to talk to you. I immediately say no, I want to talk to him… he puts her on and lectures me for 7 minutes about how I need to be there for him and how he’s so sad this week. She said it was her idea for them to come up because she has flyer miles. Wtf, so he’s not even paying?   I felt like I was being pressured. She never asked about my feelings or thoughts just kept pushing that my dad needs me. I’ve never been asked through this process how I have felt, we just have to constantly guess what he wants and try to make sure he doesn’t get mad. To mention— they are both “Christian’s”.. and we’re saying stuff like it’s gods will that we met etc. I don’t have a religion right now for context and he knows this. She was also saying that she’s not trying to be mother etc. when she was done ranting I told them I would have to tink about it and get back to them.

This doesn’t sit right with me. Hubs is livid, and heard the entire conversation. Idk what to do. I don’t want them here. I also want my feelings to be addressed and he won’t do that. He’s so childish., I was thinking of writing him a letter with very specific boundaries. He will be mad, ignore me, throw a tantrum and play victim.  I just want other insight on their experience ms and maybe some insight im missing.  Am I being a butt? I don’t think I am, but tell me if so.

1k7aaol,Am I crazy for cutting off most of my direct family?,Horror-Blacksmith55,"I'm 24 and from Argentina, this will be relevant later on cause of the state of the country's economy. And, although it might be hard to believe, although vague, everything is 100% real.

I could give a lot of context, but I think that is something only my shrink should hear.

  
Long story short, I come from one of the founding families of the country. Although the inheritance is nowhere close to what it would have been if Argentina kept itself out of socialism, it's not that bad; that would be if my father weren't an absolute mess of a person. 

  
To this day, we don't understand how he burned through 70 to 80% of the inheritance he received. He just confides way too much in very little time in absolute strangers who inflate his ego, and when we try to warn him about it he gets defensive and says all we care about is his money. By the point I was 19, the main way we saw the subject was that we'd have to build the wealth again on our own in the future, and that's fine.

  
But, 2021 came around and everything got really fucked up. My father, a writer, started an online literature course for young adults. This brought a sketchy 30-something-year-old man from the north of the country, let's call him Dani, who adored his work. He stroked his ego a lot, so he liked having him around as an assistant who helped him check for editorial blunders in his old work. 

  
That was all fine with us, until we saw Dani get jealous when my father spent his time or attention with anyone it wasn't him. In a childish manner. Then, we found out he had access to all of my father's bank accounts, and had started helping him invest his money into cryptos (-for context, my father previously didn't manage his finances until very recently, cause he was an absolute mess in keeping track and being organized. My brother's mother and his best friend's niece saved him from filing for bankruptcy after his open heart surgery 4 years prior. In appreciation, he thanked them by accusing them of stealing funds from him; that's why he currently manages his assets-), but not even that, it seems like my father even gave him the writing of his own home, the only state he had left; and who knows what else.

  
Suffice to say, we weren't big fans of Dani, even more so when we heard that he stopped all sorts of moving or exercise cause of his work, and his kneecap developed necrosis cause of an old surgery. He dislocated his knee twice for not stay still in his recovery. The second time I was in his home and took him to the hospital. The next day, I woke up to the happy surprise that Danny sent some crazy messages to the family group chat and to my brother pretending to be me and saying I had broken my father's leg, and next was my mother.

  
My brothers, father, and I had a serious sitdown and everything came to light. It seems like they were actually lovers. Initially, he said he was going to break it off after this, but minutes later, he told me he was going to choose Dani over us. The next day he reported me to the police for cohesion, supposubly for influencing him to do something he didn't want to do. 

  
From there, I cut him off and did a no-contact. Went into a deep depression where I almost didn't get out of bed for 6 months (which got worse cause my mother didn't want me to train contact sports and in a fragile state, convinced me to stop wrestling for an online course during my wrestling practice), my sister had a manic episode and my brother almost broke his hip in a biking accident. 

  
By the end of the year, when I had barely started getting better and decided to lose the weight I had gained from my inactivity, my mother changed the locks of the house cause she basically couldn't deal with me, she gave me a month in hostel and told me I should figure it out how I fed myself. This was in the middle of a 60% annual inflation in Argentina, which the next year rose to 200%. 

I won't go into details about my relationship with my mother, as it's even more complicated and rooted in my childhood. That is something I've been working on for a couple of months now with my shrink

Almost 2 years and a half later, after a lot of hardship, no savings, and working and training as a dog 6 days a week, I'm semi-stable. 

  
Now, after getting my own place and getting out of residencies living with violent cokeheads, having a decent job and starting to find success in the sports I enjoy, she says she loves me and misses me. In one early dinner, before I took a serious stand in cutting her out of my life, she told me she doesn't regret any decision, as I've grown a lot through this experience.

  
I mostly only speak with my brother (we don't share a mother) and my aunt, her sister, who is constantly asking me to amend things with her and have a relationship for my sake. I've explained to her, I don't trust her, and I'll never will. This is just the last and biggest trauma she made me endure.

  
But sometimes my mind tries to give her a chance, or I'm afraid of the day I'll have to explain to a significant other why I don't have a family... basically, am I in the wrong for just cutting everyone off and focusing on myself?",1,0,1745548535.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k7aaol/am_i_crazy_for_cutting_off_most_of_my_direct/
1k79y96,WIBTAH if I stopped living with my parents even when they try to understand me?,Serious-Narwhal8394,"Hi, I know this title is kinda weird but please stand by because i’m turning crazy from the rage I feel. I don’t know if i’m blowing things out of proportion or if i finally lost my mind. First of all, I’d like to clarify english is not my first language and there might be a lot of mistakes in this text. 
I am a 21F student who is currently living with my 54F mom and 52M. I am on my 4th year of college but i’m still missing 2 more years to complete my entire credits (My career is chemistry, not chemical eingeneering, not biochemistry, not any chemistry application, just chemistry). I was diagnosed with BPD in september 2023 and the main reason i’m reactive with rage and depressive episodes is my family. Let me tell you how our dinamic has been for a little backfround. When I was a child, my mother was in charge to raise both me and my (now 20M) brother. My dad didn’t want to be dragged into the “hard work” of raising us but he was the one who provided for all of us since he had a really stable job. Because of that, we could travel to a lot of places, food was never a problem in our home and we never had to worry about money. Also, he was the one who always took us me and my brother to the park and play. According to my mom, she was the parent who always did corrections on us (whenever we made a mistake she used to get really angry and sometimes spanked us) and my dad was the parent whom their children did fun things with. I can’t really remember a lot of things in my infance because of trauma i had. Growing up, my mother always demanded us to have good grades (here in mexico the grades go from 0 to 10) and if we got something below 8 she used to get really angry at us, i remember her screaming and us and being disapointed at us if we had 7 or 8 in one exam. our dad didn’t really cared about that but he never confronted my mom about that (nor anything else). When i was 10 or 11, my dad was transferred to the capital and for 2 years we only lived with my mom and he took a plane and visited us every 2 weeks. This really altered my perception because my mom now was fully encharged of raising us and my dad was not really in the picture and me and my brother never told dad how mom treated us always angry and how she was really hostile to us. when i was 13 my dad asked my mom to go live with him or else he would leave her and couldn’t continue like that. For a 13 year old girl who had her entire life in that city that is upsetting, i remember crying and begging to my mom to please stay in that city and she of course said no. That’s when I started self-harming because i fell into a deep depression. My mom was always cruel to us, my brother was 11 and i had less than 6 months to enjoy my friends. I remember that one month prior to moving to mexico city (December 2016) we were in the US visiting my mathernal grandma and our dad got REALLY angry at us I don’t even remember the reason. The point is, i cutted myself again and since my mom had found out about that 2 weeks prior to that incident, she took me out of the bathroom and pulled my sleeve up and saw the fresh cuts i had just made. she then started insulting me and dragged me with my dad and he… well… he didn’t took it well. i don’t wanna go into details but he got physically aggresive with me and my mom didn’t stop him and then when he calmed down he apologized crying and i was just feeling numb. a month passed and we moved cities and when we were already living there, i found out my dad was being unfaithful to my mom when i was checking his phone. I just knee something was really wrong. From that moment on, i swore to myself that i would stop talking to my dad and that was our relationship for 7 years. I didn’t talk to him and whenever i did it was complete with rage and resentment. my relationship with my mom was not good either. she was always angry and really protecting of us (i don’t think controlling, but something like that). In 2022, i had my BPD triggered because of a guy i didn’t really date but kinda did but that’s a completely different story. The result was awful. I stopped feeling emotions and only felt a void which i described as my “ground state” (chemistry term) and besides that, i also felt not anger, but a really intense rage. i stopped doing my hobbies and hanging out with friends and only focused on school in a sick way. a year passed by and my mom was always angry at me because of my room, it was always a mess and she blamed me for my mental health (I was not diagnosed yet). Some months passed by and i ended up at the psychiatrist’s office with my mom because none of the therapy i had tried worked out. that’s when i got diagnosed with bpd and narcissistic traits. also, around that time, my brother (he was 17) started living in another state and i was the only one living with my parents. also, my best friend  who was always with me in my house tried to take her own life but failed and she went back to her home town with her family, so i was completely alone. from that moment on, i decided to forgive my father for all the things he did back then. it really felt good to stop holding on to that resentment. now, with the actual story. 2 years have passed from my diagnose and i’ve learned how to live with it. i now can control my splittings and i don’t really bother anyone because i have silent bpd. both my parents have learned a lot about my disorder and they try to support me. the point is, my mom hasn’t gone to therapy when i’ve asked her several times and she’s really explosive with me. she’s the only one who can trigger my bpd and she does it a lot of times. i feel like i’m living in the shadow of my parents because i can’t leave my house, i have no money and i have a lot of problems with saving my money. i feel guarded and trapped in my own home and i have to be careful so i don’t make my mom angry. today i was studying with my best friend and i told my mom about it and she told me she didn’t believe me because yesterday i told her i was completely blocked and could not do any school work. she believed i was with my boyfriend which she completely prohibited me to be with but that’s a completely different thing. when i was 2 hours deep in my homework she sent me a message that said “I’m picking you up now, i’m already on my way” and i instantly got angry but left the library because if she arrived and i wasn’t there she would be a thousand times angrier. When i left the building, i called my dad and my brother (he’s visiting us because of vacations) if they were with my mom and they said she hadn’t left the house yet and she was in the bathroom. i got really angry and texted her what her problem was, that i had stopped doing homework and she didn’t even had left the house and she immediatly left the house when i texted her. i was histerically sobbing in public because i was really angry and i felt like i was gonna explote. when she arrived i didn’t say a word to her and she saw how angry i was and didn’t say a word to me either. when we arrived home, i immediately went to my room and started doing research on how to win money because i am completely saturated with this house. the thing that hurts me the most is that 5 days ago she apologized to me for all the trauma that she gave me when i was little and said she would try to improve. i am stuck here, my mental health is getting worse and i have no money for therapy, much less for moving out and since i don’t know what else to do, i decided to vent here where nobody knows me and people have objective opinions. what should i do? i am not kidding i have 400 MXN (20 USD approximately) on my name and because of my school schedule i can’t work. maybe nobody will see this but even when i’m writing this i feel much better. If somebody is reading this please forgive me, this is a complete mess and i tried to put my emotions into words.",1,0,1745547462.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k79y96/wibtah_if_i_stopped_living_with_my_parents_even/
1k7961z,i think my mom likes another guy and i’m not sure that i’m completely mad about it,No_Idea_7561,"for some context my parents had me when they were in high school and have stayed together since.

as i’ve gotten older i’ve realized how shitty my dad can be. he’s not abusive or manipulative or anything like that, it’s more so just a lack of care that he has. besides going to work he doesn’t do anything else but sit around the house. he’s not gone to a single one of my sisters soccer games in close to 3 years, he doesn’t go to school events, he doesn’t take my mom out, he doesn’t spend time with us kids one on one at all, he doesn’t really have friends, i mean he won’t even go to the grocery store when my mom asks. he kinda just does what he wants and that’s it. this has caused a lot of issues between my parents; they don’t really fight but my dad will be mean and i can tell that it upsets my mother. 

this past year my mother has been coaching my sisters soccer team and she coaches it with another parent. i’ve slowly started to pick up that my mom maybe likes him more than just a friend. it’s little comments here and there but i just have this gut feeling. my mom would never cheat, but if she did i’m not sure i would be 100% mad. my dad would be devastated if she ever actually left him but he can’t expect to do nothing in the marriage and still get what he wants.

this has been hard pressed in my mind for a while now but it really hit me today when my mother and i were at the park watching pickle ball when my mother said that she wishes my dad would take her out to do stuff like this for her. it made me extremely upset for her and ever since this has been all i’ve thought about. 

any advice would be appreciated as to how i’m supposed to be dealing with this because each day feels like more and more added stress.

1k76d2r,MIL hoards food and knick knacks in MY house - WWYD,OnTheTrailRadio,"Hi everyone, I don't really use reddit much, and don't know of any mannerisms so pardon me if I get something wrong. So to start - I grew up pretty minimal. I was made to clean the house every day as a child, and we never kept ANYTHING we didn't use. Long story short, I keep my current house that way as an adult. I don't like a messy anything, and I don't like useless items (ie, we don't use them, not useless in the derogatory manner). 
I'm about to be 24, and am married (been together for 9 years). We just had a baby, and I had expectations about how to raise my child and the house we raise her in. My mother in law lives 9 states away, ans has been flying in every other week to ""help"" with the baby, although she dosent, she just takes pictures of her and sleeps at the house. It makes my wife feel better though, so it's worth it. 

More about my MIL. Growing up, her house was always a complete disaster, a house of 9 people, and always having trash, food, and clothes and broken items everywhere. There was not an inch of the house that didn't have items in it. If there was a shelf, you couldn't see the wood it was made of. Every knick knack had a story, and every piece of broken furniture had a reason for staying. Her fridge was full of food nobody ate, or was even allowed to eat at times becuase they were ""saving it"". She was an extreme couponer who lost money on couponing. She'd buy 50 cans of corn, just to never eat them. When they were evicted out of their house, it was bad enough the city just tore it down. They moved ALL of their items to the storage unit. I helped of course, but only becuase if I didn't, they'd make my wife do it all with them. 

Fast forward to today. They live in Florida, and rent out a house. It looks much better, but that's becuase they lost everything becuase they couldn't afford storage units in ohio forever. It's slowly becoming more cluttered there, but that isn't my problem. My problem is the fact that she now flies up here every 2 weeks, and fills my fridge with food. And I don't mean she buys milk, eggs, and cheese. She went to the grocery store, bought enough food for 3 people for a month, and it was mostly food only she liked. She did it under the guise of buying us food, but she knew that we didn't like most of what she bought. She came home with 5 cases of soda, 6 vitamin waters, and threw them on the floor in my kitchen. She then proceeded to order 4 boxes of LaRosa pizza, even though altogether we only went through 2, and we could have COOKED something that she just bought, or we had (we meal prepped for 3 months). She then also ordered 4 steak hoagie under the guise that Florida dosent sell steak hoagie? And she'll take them back on her flight in a week (gross?). She then also ordered dominoes, and other fast food items. I have thrown everything out before, becuase when she leaves, it all goes bad, and we're here to clean it up. But she dosent see it, and dosent care. I keep my fridge stocked, but not full. I have 3 racks, and keep the necessities (Milk, eggs, cheese, creamer[get to that in a second], lunch meat, bread, vegetables, soda, and water). I have more than that, but know that there's space to put items if we need to, but I prefer we eat what we have. I grew up where if you didn't finish your food, you ate it later. She puts food in the fridge under the guise she will, but then leaves back to Florida. It's hard to explain without picture attachments in the SR, but I think you get the point. But if not, just know it goes from being a fridge that has everything to feed a person but still having space, to food literally falling out of the fridge and being expired before we can get through any of it. 

Altgough we had other items she would being in (clothes for baby that were too small and couldnt even fit her anymore, puzzles and then leaving them half built, shelf knick knacks, plush animals[were up to like 9 now of BIG ones], and a few other big items that take up space in my room, including clothes she left here, and just left with them on the floor and in corners) but, Food is definitely the worst of it, and we even had a blow up where she stated she was leaving early, and it broke my wife's heart. This has been going in for 4 months though, and nothing had changed. 

I'm fed up, and actually feel depressed about the entire situation. I feel as though I haven't owned my own house for the last 4ish months. Wwyd? What even CAN I do? I'm not usually a pushover, but for my wife's happiness I am. But I bought a house for a reason. I worked my butt off for 5 years straight, doing 70-80 hour weeks to pay for this house to say I could have my own space. There are a few factors to put in recently within the last week that have caused more people than usual to appear at my house, but this has been an ongoing issue. I can't even escape to my room, or my basement becuase I've made room for other people. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. All my wife does is say don't be mad at me, but I've told her that it isn't her, it's her mother and her mother's lack of respect for me, my house, my rules, and how I feel. I can't even control the temperature my house is at without her taking control, and changing it in my sleep. I can't go out to the garage without her running and getting more food, or more knick knacks we never asked for or stuff we will never use. I have thrown away over 2000 dollars of food and knick knacks over the last 4 months, and it hurts my soul becuase that wasn't allowed as a child. We ate it. Not let it sit and rot. Wwyd, stuff like that. I feel as though I can't explain how bad it actually is through text, of that makes sense. I've never seen someone with a stomach staple have 4 separate drinks, and 5 separate foods from 9 separate getting up to grab food sitting at one time. I swear. A coke, a coffee, and 2 half drank water bottles, with 5 different foods she won't finish, and will just leave sitting out in the living room or kitchen. It's foul, and I don't think I can ever understand. ",1,0,1745536645.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k76d2r/mil_hoards_food_and_knick_knacks_in_my_house_wwyd/
1k755e7,[F33] Struggling with controlling family dynamics — how do I take the narrative back?,Internal_Penalty_416,"Hi everyone. I'm in a complicated situation with my family, especially my brother \[M33\] and his girlfriend \[F29\], and I need some advice on how to take back control of the narrative and find peace.

A while ago, I went through a very tough time. I was moving, struggling with mental health, and trying to survive my master's studies and teaching responsibilities in a new city without much of a support system. During that time, my brother and his girlfriend helped me move. I truly appreciated it, but it seems like that ""favor"" has been silently hanging over my head ever since. They never said it outright, but there’s an unspoken expectation — like I owe them — and nothing I do seems good enough.

After the move, things really started to go downhill. My brother began promising things — like visiting me, helping me out, picking me up from the station so I could attend birthdays or family events — and then just… not showing up. Not even cancelling, just ignoring me. I’d be left standing at the station, or waiting all day, completely emotionally crushed. Meanwhile, I was already hanging on by a thread, trying to build a new life while feeling isolated, overwhelmed, and burned out.

He did listen to me on the phone quite often during that time. I’d talk to him about how hard things were for me, and he seemed to be there. But it was always on his terms — when he had time or felt like it. And he’d also often vent about our parents and how things were with them. It wasn’t one-sided, but again, always on his conditions.

When I tried to give something back, I helped them with their house renovations. But no matter what I did, it wasn’t good enough. My brother was often stressed and reacted aggressively — on two occasions, physically rough and Julia just ignoring it. He later apologized, but the impact stayed with me. His girlfriend Julia always backs him up and tends to control how we interact. It feels like she decides everything — what happens, who’s involved — and he just follows her lead.

On top of that, whenever I was at my parents' place, my mom would constantly control and direct me — how I should behave, how I should feel, especially around my dad. I always have to be cheerful, agreeable, helpful. There’s no space to just be.

When I try to set boundaries or express how I feel, I’m told I’m overreacting, being dramatic, or playing the victim. Last year, Julia organized a family outing and didn’t invite me. That hurt. I tried to reconnect by organizing something myself later, which actually went well.

A month and a half ago, they came to visit me. My brother kept physically teasing me in ways that crossed my boundaries. When I addressed it calmly afterward, he laughed it off. I then sent a stronger message saying that if it happened again, I wouldn’t want to see him anymore. Julia responded by saying “that’s not how you treat family” and demanded I pay for a dinner I never even asked her to pay for. Then they posted cheerful family photos on social media — like nothing had happened. That felt like a slap in the face.

Out of frustration, I blocked her. The next day, she called to say I’m always too emotional and that they’re always the ones caring for me, but I never do anything for them. But they never acknowledge my perspective. They only focus on what they don’t get from me, and never on what I do give — which is never enough in their eyes anyway.My brother no longer communicates with me directly — everything goes through Julia. I’ve told him this is between us, but he ignores me. Julia holds all the power in the dynamic, and my brother enables it.

My mom pressures me to apologize and tells me I’m still welcome — if I come over separately and if I’m in a “good mood.” Again, conditional acceptance. Always.

They also celebrated Easter and my dad’s birthday together — without me and keep posting happy pictures (about random stuff) in the family group chat — while she keeps me blocked on social media. It’s this strange mix of exclusion and performance that just adds to the pain.

I even sent Julia a gentle message saying, “I hope we can talk when you’re ready, and I understand if you need more time,” but I realize now I made myself small again. I gave her control. And that’s not sitting right with me.

In about 8 weeks, I have my master’s graduation expo. I really want my parents to be there. But I’m scared they won’t come because of all this tension and the fact that my disabled sister needs care — something they usually handle together. It requires planning. I don’t know if I should try to resolve all this before the expo, or put it aside and focus on my studies.

I feel like I’ve completely lost control of how I’m seen in this family. Julia drives the narrative, my brother follows, and I’m always either the problem, or the emotional one. I’m exhausted. I want to be seen for what I’m going through. For what I’ve already given. Not punished for not meeting their silent expectations.

How do I take back control of the narrative? How do I deal with this exclusion, the imbalance, and the silence? Should I reach out again, or wait until after my expo? I’m emotionally drained, and this is affecting my ability to concentrate on what’s supposed to be one of the most important moments of my life.

Any advice would be so appreciated.

TL;DR:Brother \[M33\] and his girlfriend \[F29\] helped me during a rough patch, but it now feels like I’m silently indebted. He promised support and never followed through. They exclude me, ignore boundaries, and control communication. I feel erased. With my graduation expo coming up, I want my family there, but don’t know how to handle the tension. How do I take back control of how I’m seen in this dynamic?",2,0,1745533282.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k755e7/f33_struggling_with_controlling_family_dynamics/
1k73jgq,Am I overreacting?,CantaloupeNew5684,"My sister’s giving birth in a few months, and of course, there’s going to be a baby shower. She lives halfway across the world, so I’ve been thinking about how I could possibly help plan something or at least be involved. I did hear that her husband’s brother (who lives there) might also be planning something, but nothing was confirmed, and since it’s still 3/4 months away, I hadn’t reached out yet.

Then out of nowhere, my mom gets a text with an invitation to the baby shower — from him... And I’m honestly so upset. Like, he didn’t even bother to tell me he was planning it? Not even a quick message to acknowledge it or loop me in?

I told my mom how I felt, and instead of understanding, she got mad and said I was overreacting. She told me I should’ve reached out when I first heard something might be happening. But like… we weren’t even sure yet, and it was still so early. And I’m sorry, but if I was the one planning something, I’d absolutely think to include her. So why isn’t the same expected from him?

Also side note: I’M HER ONLY SISTER. So it’s just super frustrating and hurtful that I got left out like this. And it sucks even more that my own mom is invalidating how I feel about it.",1,0,1745529047.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k73jgq/am_i_overreacting/
1k7245h,My Adult Married Sister is Destroying My Parents House/Property,Boose_Loose,"I have a sister in her early-mid 20s who is married to her husband in his late 20s. They are currently living rent free in a small upstairs room of my parents house and also own a dog. The room smells horrible while the rest of the house is meticulously kept beautiful by my mother. The carpets are destroyed and the walls are damaged within their room. What is much worse, however, is the backyard and property around the house. My parents have put lots of money and hard work to maintain a beautiful yard, yet the dog has destroyed the lawn by running in the same places over and over leaving an unsightly dirt trench. Additionally the dog poop is left all over the place with a litteral mountain of poop in one corner of the backyard. My parents have asked them to take the dog elsewhere and clean up, but my sister does not want to cooperate and has even resulted to physical blows towards my parents when asked to do simple things that should be common sense. It gets even worse since the husband is a mechanic and has at least 3 vehicles and a trailer on the premesis, all of which barely function and require him to dump money into keeping them funcational, which money obviously could be used to buy a good car that actually works or you know, pay rent. The cars are ugly and take up a lot of space. Even the neighbors have complained because of the ugly vehicles parked on the street and beside the house. My mother accepted my sister and her husband back into her house when they were kicked out of their previous residence. If not for my mother, they would have been homeless. 

The husband is employed and makes roughly 50k a year. My sister is unemployed and refuses to work for mental health issues. I don't doubt that she has had trauma, but it is extremely evident that she could work but simply doesn't want to. She stays in her room all day and only leaves to take the dog outside once or twice a day. All of the money made by the husband is wasted within days of each paycheck in car parts, uber eats, and other unnesessary expenses. They refuse to move out and say that they cannot afford a house/paying rent. I earn the same amount as the husband and live in an appartment with my wife who is unable to work currently as we are waiting for her green card. We live easily off of my income in the same area as my parents proving that my sister and her husband could rent an appartment and survive.

My parents need them to move out and to be more independant. The obvious solution would be to tell them to respect the house rules or move out, but my mother does not want to ruin her relationship with my sister. Not only that, but my sister has even threatened suicide and resulted to violence as I mentioned earlier when confronted about the situation. It has gotten so bad that my mother wants to sell the house to have a good reason to get away from everything. My father is in the same boat as my mother. Both are extremely patient and kind to my sister, but they are suffering.

Any thoughts or tips would be appreciated! I am very curious to see what others would have to say about this whole mess.",1,1,1745525487.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k7245h/my_adult_married_sister_is_destroying_my_parents/

My in-laws have always been so welcomed towards me, even my MIL has called me daughter and we had work together in managing the properties they have pretty great.
When we started dating his sister didn't like me and was always wanting to take a fight, I didnt reciprocate and my In-laws always defend me but without setting boundaries, because after all is their precious daughter.
Fast-forward to this day I thought my SIL and I had a basic respect relationship, specially even when she needed help for a few days and I travel to her house and for 1 week I took care of her daughter, cook and clean de house. 
But the other day my MIL ask me to send some messages from her cellphone, not unusual, and I found a group chat called ""top secret"" I have to confess that I shouldn't have open it but I am human and was curious... Well the group was basically my SIL seeking praises for every thing she did as she portraits as the perfect woman and mother, but that's another topic, and her badwashing me about everything and telling awful things like that I am a golddigger that at anyminute I gonna left my husband, that I am secretly knowing everything of what they have so I can take it away, etc etc
I was really devastated and furious, my in-laws ignore in the chat all her comments and sometimes try to tell her is not that way, but never defended me o put a boundary. What should I do? How should I treat this person? Especially when I try to tell something to my in-laws they said that it's not her been despicable just that she is jealous because I still her little brother or something in that line.
If it was for me I don't want nothing to do with her, specially I don't want my daughter been near her but my husband still love his sister and my in-laws love her daughter, I don't want to be the person that tells them ""it's me or her""

1k6o561,My parents and me having problems but I don't know how to communicate with them,Reasonable_Middle_44,"Hey people of reddit, 
I'm here to vent and possible have a some kind of outside perspectives. Let me introduce myself, I'm Aliyah (fake name) 20 f , college student. I don't live in the states, I'm from an asian country. I'm only child to my parents and growing up with them pretty tense for me. 

For context, my parents let's call them Shawn (60m) and Shelly (50f) are helicopter parents, my teachers, peers, councilors and many others had talk with them regarding this but nothing changed. Being an only child all attention of my parents was on me, Especially my mother, she is a stay at home mom as well. My father who was once married before, no children from previous marriage isn't too involved in parenting like my mother . But I'm scared to death by them.

My mother Shelly, is a person who wants her off spring to be the perfect child, she wanted me to get straight A's, win every competition, be woman like, be perfect in all ways. I on the other hand wasn't like that, tho I had good grades, it was never enough for my mother. I loved to play sports and used to play basketball and volleyball since I was a tall kid was always choose for this more than dancing or singing... this made my mother quite angry, she does like it... if I got a bad grade or could remember something she used to beat on my head with broom stick or beat me with anything she could find, until I turn black, blue or purple. Once I accidentally spill milk ,in front of my friend who had came for a play date,  my mother started to beat in front of her only stopped when my friend started crying. She told her parents and that day onwards I lost her as my friend.

My father even after seeing me getting beaten for somethings never stood up for me. He said I deserved this, I sometimes believe I do as well, my boyfriend, my friends and teachers says otherwise but I'm not sure sometimes. He was basically used as a threat by my mother, since I'm scared I was always hiding from them how I feel. 

Whenever I speak to them of how I feel, they bring up the fact I'm so much hard to look after, I'm a crazy kid who doesn't appreciate them, keep saying about my father's struggle to provide me and raise me... they don't care how I feel, even after having to take me to hospital due to anxiety and depression. To them I never gonna be enough. They hate my boyfriend, they call his family and talked badly saying racist things but then his parents has only been nice to me but my friends distance themselves and I feel like I'm getting closed in by many walls.

My mother used to compare me to this girl, Let's call her Kelly for now,  Kelly was opposite of what I am, she the perfect child she never had to mu mother. Every morning I was told me like her until we moved away when I was 12, our families cut contact with each other... until then I was walking in egg shells.

The School life for me wasn't easy as well, I was bullied by seniors and classmates, teachers always made me feel weak, bully me, and say things that did not happened to my parents knowing how my parents would react. I used to be scared to go home, because I knew beating, shouting or humiliation was waiting for me or some days I get sugar coated mother. 

I feel a lot of emotions and i know even my boyfriend has a limit to hearing my vent... I'm scared he will push me away too like my friends. I'm scared, I don't know what to do, so people of reddit please help in this situation, I'm longer in a good mindset to think properly.

1k6n3f6,"My Grandmother Is Emotionally Abusing My Mom and Using My Dad, but He Won’t See It",Ok_Ambassador_8336,"I'm 16 years old, and I have a little brother who’s 7. There are seven people in my family: me, my mum, dad, younger brother, grandma, and grandpa. Ever since my mum married into this family, she’s never truly been accepted. In my grandparents’ eyes, their “real” family only includes themselves and their three biological children. They’ve never treated my mum like one of their own. What makes it even more unfair is that my aunt’s and uncle’s spouses are treated with love and respect like they belong. But my mum? She’s constantly being emotionally abused, especially by my grandmother. She’s made to feel small, unimportant, and unwanted in the very home she helps hold together. It hurts so much to see her suffering like this. My mum always told me that they are old people so we should always be nice to them no matter how they treat us as they are not able to properly understand some things which might give you an idea of what kind of person my mother is but everyone has their breaking point

What makes things worse is my dad. He doesn’t stand up for her. Even when my mum tries to speak up about what’s happening, he shuts her down. He’s been ignoring her pain for years. It was only when she finally threatened to leave him that he started to realize how serious things had become. Now, he’s stuck in the middle torn between choosing the woman he married and had children with, or staying loyal to the parents who raised him. But honestly, the choice should be clear. He should be standing with us, his wife and kids, not defending people who are actively hurting us.

And it’s not just emotional abuse. My grandmother has been using my dad, especially when it comes to money. She’s made him pay off the gambling debts of her other sons, even though he’s still trying to manage his own financial struggles. It’s like she doesn’t care about him she just uses him as a source of money and support. To make things even worse, there are some really disturbing signs that she might be involved in black magic or something spiritual that’s not safe. That could be one reason why my dad seems so blinded to everything and why he keeps forgiving her, even when she keeps hurting him and everyone else around her.

The whole situation is really heavy. It’s painful and scary, and it feels like it’s tearing our family apart a little more every day. My mum doesn’t deserve any of this. She deserves love, peace, and respect. And my little brother deserves a home that doesn’t feel like a war zone

**P.S.** English is not my first language, and I wrote this with the help of AI to express everything clearly. If there are any husbands or fathers out there who have been in a similar situation caught between their parents and their wife I would really appreciate it if you could share what you did to help your marriage. My parents still love each other deeply, and I truly believe that, despite how hard things are right now, there’s still a chance to fix this. Hearing from others who’ve been through something like this could give us hope and maybe even a path forward.",2,0,1745482986.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k6n3f6/my_grandmother_is_emotionally_abusing_my_mom_and/
1k6mq74,"Open Letter: In a Changing World, May the Family Remain Sacred",povofhappy,"
To parents, spouses, and to all who believe in the sanctity of family,  

Times are changing. What was once considered taboo or unacceptable is now often brushed off as ""normal."" One of these is the growing acceptance of infidelity—where having an affair is sometimes treated as no big deal, where commitment is taken lightly, and where breaking a family apart is dismissed as just another life choice.  

Yes, it’s true: society evolves. Culture shifts, perspectives broaden. But some things should remain sacred—and the family is one of them.  

 Why Does It Matter?
Because when marriages break down and families fall apart, the ones who suffer the most are **the children**. They grow up questioning love, commitment, and stability. They carry the weight of broken trust into their own future relationships. Studies show that children from broken homes often struggle with emotional security, self-worth, and even their own marriages later in life.  

 The Danger of ""Normalizing"" What Shouldn’t Be Normal
Just because something becomes common doesn’t make it right. If we treat infidelity, dishonesty, and fractured families as ""just the way things are,"" what are we teaching the next generation? That love disposable? That vows are just words? That family is temporary?  

A Plea for Integrity 
Change is inevitable, but **not all change is progress. Let’s hold on to what truly matters:  
- Loyalty in marriage, because trust is the foundation of love.  
- Responsibility- in parenting, because children deserve stability.  
- Respect for the sacredness of family, because it shapes the future.  

To the younger generation watching:
 Love is not just a feeling—it’s a choice, a commitment, a promise. And family is not just an institution—it’s a sanctuary.  

May we never confuse ""common"" with ""right."" May we never sacrifice what is sacred for what is convenient.  

Because some things—like the family—should never be broken.

1k5r0sg,My sister (34) wants to leave her partner for an 18-year-old—and leave my 17-year-old niece behind. I don’t know what to do.,Hurricane_Tropicana2,"Hi Reddit. I’ve been sitting with this situation for a while now and could really use some outside perspective.



My eldest sister (34) has been in a long-term relationship with a man she says has been emotionally unhealthy and possibly violent at times. Recently, she’s made the decision to leave him—which I honestly support, because I do think she deserves better.



The part that’s thrown me is that she’s leaving him not just for freedom, but because she wants to start a relationship with an 18-year-old guy. She’s known him for a while and even encouraged him to join the military. Now she’s talking about marrying him. To say there’s a huge age gap—and a major imbalance in life experience—is an understatement. It feels concerning, and honestly, uncomfortable.



What makes this even more complicated is my 17-year-old niece. She has no idea what’s going on. My sister doesn’t plan to tell her the full truth and is considering leaving her in the care of the man she’s leaving—her long-term partner—despite the unhealthy environment. She doesn’t want my niece to stay with our mom either, and I don’t think she’s seriously considering taking her with her.



There’s also a lot of secrecy around my niece’s biological father that could come to the surface if custody or living arrangements change. My niece is smart and sensitive, and she deserves stability—but I don’t know what role I should or *can* play in all of this, ya know?



I’ve tried to talk to my sister gently, but she gets defensive quickly, especially when it comes to my niece or the new relationship.



I don’t want to abandon her, but I also feel like I need to advocate for my niece’s safety and well-being. I feel caught between protecting my relationship with my sister and doing what’s right for my niece.



Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you support someone who’s making what feels like harmful choices without pushing them away? And should I step in more actively when it comes to my niece? I don’t want to overstep, but I also don’t want to look back and wish I’d done more.



Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: !!!!

Thank you to everyone who responded to my original post—it really helped me stay grounded while navigating such a difficult time.

Since then, a lot has happened. My sister officially moved out of her ex’s house, and I helped her get her belongings out. Before she even broke the news to her ex, she told her daughter (my niece), who is understandably devastated and feels deeply abandoned.

The situation has become more complicated because my sister is still actively pursuing her relationship with the much younger man—now to the point of planning to marry him at the end of this month.

Right now, my sister is living with one of our other siblings. Meanwhile, my niece is staying with me and our parents (her grandparents). My mom is moving forward with getting emergency custody, especially since my sister has made comments about sending my niece back to her ex (my niece’s former stepdad) in hopes of “repairing” things.

We’re trying to create as much stability as possible for my niece right now. She’s in sad and confused, and honestly, I’m drained. But I’m doing my best to show up for her the way she deserves. Making sure she gets to school and does something fun afterwards. 

If anyone has advice on how to best support a teenager who’s feeling abandoned by a parent—or how to help her process a sudden divorce from someone who, while not her biological parent, was a major figure in her life—I would really appreciate it. Navigating that kind of grief and detachment is hard at any age, but especially at hers.

Thanks!

My mother 80y and my father who was going to be 82y. One day before we even knew my dad had cancer, we were talking about when we die if we wanted to be buried or cremated. My dad said he wanted cremated. I joked and said that I would take his and my mother's ashes to Walmart with me to go shopping. My dad hated Walmart,  which is why I said it as a joke. Well he believed me. Cut to us finding out he was dying. He put my brother in charge if taking care if his cremation and everything involved in his affairs. My sister came down from the state she lived in to be with him until the end. My family and I moved to the state my mother and dad lived at from a different state to help them. Seven years we were here helping them. My brother took over everything and took all the stuff my family and my sister had given my dad over the years. Things that my dad said would go back to us. My brother always said that he didn't want anything as we got older. Yet he sweeped in and took everything. My sister and he got into a fight and he called her and I low lives and told her my mother didn't want her there. He's in the service so he thinks he's better than us. He was always the golden child because he was the only boy. My mother is a nericess. I know misspelled. She would pit us kids against each other growing up. Her favorite was always my brother. She turned her back on my sister during the fight, saying she wasn't getting involved. So now my sister isn't talking to anyone one even me who supposed her through this. I told my mother and brother that I'm distance myself from all of them to take care of my health. I did realize until after my dad died that he kepted this family together. Do I miss them no.

My auntie has a different style of teaching basic life skills, like I said earlier, she expects me to learn and watch then immediately know but never pushed me to my limits and actually taught me physically because she was so used to teaching everyone that because of her daughter that ended up being more of a clean freak than her. I get it, she wants me to be like her, but people are different, they learn differently. Some others easily learn to do it and some progress slowly. I am that person that progress slowly. I was never used to cleaning because I was never encouraged, taught, and motivated. I feel like it's all my fault because they bombard me a lot that I'll never make it out alive as an adult. I forgot to mention that all my relatives blame my auntie for raising me but she's a genuinely nice person but she's just stuck in the old ways of teaching a kid how to clean. I just feel so sympathetic when I'm around her. It's difficult talking to her about her ways of teaching because she always finds ways to get to my soft spot.

My brother is also like my other relatives. He always insults me and tells me that I'm lazy and judges everything I do but at the end he never taught me how to clean and do things. Everyone in this family is insufferable. That's why I'm too shy to clean, they judge everything. I was never meant to be in this family nor be alive but at the end it's fate anyway on why I ended up in this family.

I am slowly learning how to do basic life skills because of my friend who volunteers to help me clean, cook, do the laundry, cook rice, etc. I just hope I make it alive as an adult. 


If you're also in a situation like me and was never taught by your parents or family, I think it's time to learn on your own or get help from a friend. There's multiple videos and forums on how to do basic life skills than your parents never taught you.

And if you guys have any cleaning suggestions and tips, please comment! I'd appreciate it! Especially cooking tips! Peace out! ",3,0,1745372093.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k5nctm/i_wasnt_taught_basic_life_skills_and_my_family/

I have a steady job, morally upright, always have helped my parents out with anything and they still clearly like him more. I just don't understand.

1k5evtw,Family constantly making hurtful comments about my lifestyle and appearance,Specialist_Brief_415,"I (23F) have been struggling with constant, snide comments from my older sister, younger sister, and brother-in-law. They often mock me for living a healthy lifestyle — things like eating balanced meals, avoiding fast food, and being disciplined with my habits. They also make remarks about my appearance, especially because I’m thinner than them and have a different sense of style (which they describe in a mocking way, e.g. calling me a “baddie” sarcastically).

At first, I tried to ignore it, but over time it’s become emotionally exhausting. It feels like no matter what I do, they find a way to criticize or belittle me. I’ve never commented on their eating habits or lifestyle choices, and I find it really unfair to be treated this way for simply living differently.

I’m trying to stay confident and not let it affect me, but the constant jabs are starting to wear me down. I’m looking for advice on how to set boundaries, respond without escalating things, or mentally protect myself from their negativity.

1k5ckq5,is my mom grounding me from the kitchen normal??,jesus_chrust2037,"my mom just grounded me from the kitchen again, in her words she doesn't even want me to get water on my own. it sucks because she doesn't really cook at all anymore and she doesnt really order, she does not have an ED but she also just doesn't really eat a lot. she definitely isn't going to get up and make me something so when this happens i live off whatever meal she decides to give me if she does and i have to kinda just live off whatever snacks i can find and sneak back to my room. 

the reasoning for this time is because she collects rocks and leaves them in the non-disposal side of the sink, so i leave them there but keep up with any food scraps, dishes, etc that go to that side since some of the dishwashing tools are stored in that side anyways. i'm not sure what she expects me to do because i still scrubbed the sink and made sure there's nothing rotting last time i did the dishes, i know 100% the rocks in the sink is weird as fuck but i just cope with it.

1k5aywc,"Adult mid-30's Male, Struggling with parental relationships.",Ok_Phrase4779,"**Hello Reddit**



I have been struggling on and off with my parents for most of my adult life. As much as journaling constantly about my gripes and sorrows to myself, I’d like some feedback from others. Maybe connect with people who are going through similar experiences. (Sorry for the length, it all had to come out)



**The Backstory:**



**Myself,** now mid-30’s Male, have divorced parents (they unfortunately waited until I was in my early 20’s to divorce). I experienced a full childhood of screaming, swearing, yelling, slamming and breaking things, emotional manipulation from my mother, and physical abuse from my father. 



**My mom** ruled with guilt and embarrassment as her tools of the parenting trade. She would host small get-togethers all the time, and embarrass me constantly by revealing very personal things about me, or things that I did as a child. This would happen in front of the entire group, while I was present. It was a constant habit. Sometimes her guests would directly tell her that it wasn’t nice/appropriate right after she said it, and she would pretend to act sorry and surprised, like she didn’t know what she did. If she wanted things done? Guilt. Always a guilt trip. Everything.



**My father** was silent, until he wasn’t. A real MOAB type. He would sit in his recliner after work, with a stack of beers, and watch Star-trek. You could never get his attention. On the rare occasion that i dared get his attention, I would just yell “DAD” right infant of his face, and it couldn’t budge his attention. When it was finally time for his bi-weekly (twice a week) blowout, you could guarantee the entire neighborhood knew what was happening. And occasionally the local PD. 



It would start with questions/accusations of something that was said, done, not done, touched, or broken. After a few minutes when he didn’t get the answered he was expecting, there was always the typical slap across the face to start it all off. It was always by surprise, my guess was on purpose; once you released it was coming, it had already happened.



Things would always escalate. The yelling was always ear piercing. The comments were always degrading. “Kids are little shits”, “when you have kids, that’s all you have”, “Worthless”, “Ungrateful”. As I got older, “Cocksucker”, “Little Fucker”. The list goes on. Hard to remember when you’re getting held against the wall by your throat, not being able to reach the floor. Or being punched in the face, held down on the bed, hair being pulled and being dragged. 



**The Now:**



**Myself,** still mid-30’s male, twice Married, two children. First wife left me for another man (A true hallmark blessing) after a totally garbage marriage that happened too young. She ended up with someone 5 times as worse as myself at that time. That divorce allowed me to figure out what this shell has inside of it. I gained confidence for the first time. Knew who I was and what I was about. Found the love of my life who I had known most of my adult life already. I’m very happy and content with my immediate life and family (The ones under my roof). To be honest, I never get the urge to reach out to my family. I feel guilty for not feeling anything towards either of them, like it’s my fault. I feel like I still downplay the abuse I endured as a kid. It’s wild to write out even a fraction of it, and still be like, “damn”…



My relationship with my parents is still strained. My mom tries to pretend she loves me and her grandkids. My father either completely refuses to acknowledge any terrible things he did, or brags in front of people that his beatings really got his kids in line. 



**My Mom** lives for the public image of herself. Attention is her drug, and Facebook is her paraphernalia. She jumps from female partner to female partner. She lets them spoil her rotten, and does nothing from them in return. When the “wow” effect of her LGBTQ lifestyle wears off, she moves on to another. She see’s her grandchildren very seldom, maybe 4 times a year. Never asks about them. But has no issue spending time and posting pictures of other peoples children, or her nieces/nephews all over Facebook. You know, #Family stuff. 



I’ve brought up her behavior countless times. We’ve had plenty of blowouts and periods of not talking. Nothing changes. She’ll try for a few days, but she genuinely just isn’t interested. And I find it almost impossible to try on my end. I’ve just got nothing to give honestly. Despite living 10 minutes away, she NEVER comes by. When she does, it’s brief. An hour max. She’s always got social obligations. On the rare occasion she watches the kids, she’s ready to give them back the second I drop them off. There’s just nothing to build off of. 



**My Dad** has tamed down quite a bit since the divorce. When my mom left, I was the one there, quite literally, picking him off the floor. He emptied the house of pretty much everything. He refused to celebrate holidays for a while. I would buy him a Christmas tree and set it up for him to surprise him, and he would just act irritated. He finally started getting better over the course of a couple of years. I would always be over there spending time with him, doing things for him. He suddenly ALWAYS talked about grandkids. Obsessed with the thought and excitement of potentially having them someday. And all the things he would do with them. 



He then met his now-wife who came with a whole entire family. Expanding on that later… My first wife had gotten pregnant at this time. We shared the exciting news with him, and received a very disappointing reaction. “Oh cool” he says. Come to find out, my now-stepsister had JUST had a baby boy. She was completely reliant on her mom doing and paying for everything for her. A real leech-type. My dad had been taking this boy to doctors appointments, shopping, you name it, they were doing it together. “My little buddy” he would say right in front of me, as I hold his only granddaughter in my arms. Who he still has NEVER watched once, or done anything with. I still feel that disappointment to the day.



A couple years later, I gave him his first ACTUAL grandson. And my step-sister has given him another “grandson” by marriage around the same time. He spends a crazy amount of time with the two of them, while his actual grandkids see him 3 times a year maybe? (Also only lives 15 minutes away)



I know this is forever long, and I will try to wrap it here. But I feel like some backstory is important. I’m trying to find a way to let the resentment go, but it’s literally the only thing I have. The only thing I have control of. I feel like both my parents have lost their minds (Or never had them?). I don’t think my father has the mental capacity to be capable of self-reflection. I think he genuinely doesn’t think anything about his actions, then and now. Not in a mean way, he’s just a “simple” man. And was also very abused by his military father. I don’t want to continue on giving my parents the satisfaction of showing up for rare family events, and answering “nothing but question” text messages. I think ideally, l’d just like to let go of that connection (or the placeholder for the connection). 



It’s my opinion that your blood family should take some sort of precedence over the family you married into (Been with his wife for about 5 years). Not to say he shouldn’t be doing anything with his other grandkids by marriage. But if my grandkids aren’t getting ANY involvement, neither should they. His new family is definitely top priority. And his step children are so dependent on them, financially, childcare, and just all around help with life, that they and their children are ALWAYS at his house. 



My mom is a lost cause. I’m irritated with her fakeness, her lack of involvement, and her inability to settle down and sit still for more than 10 minutes. I don’t know if there’s anything to rebuild there. I think I’m mostly just bothered by the injustice of it all, and not the actual lack of relationship on either side. Maybe someone will find this interesting, or relatable. Or want to share their similar experiences. I don’t know, just wanted to get it out there. 



TL;DR



Parents abusive during Childhood. Now parents have a new life and are totally uninvolved with their grandkids and myself, but spend plenty of time with literally anyone else.

1k51abh,My grandmother wants me (14F) to talk to my father again after he caused me to try to end my life,Fair_Peak7047,"TW: talks of suicide, and brief mention of domestic violence

Recently my grandmother has been putting more pressure on me to get back in touch with my father after just a year and a half of him loosing custody.

It’s kind of a long story but my parents had a very messy divorce that got finalized just a couple of years ago. The reason for the divorce is because my father cheated a lot on my mom for about a decade (this is important later). I was also much closer to my father at the time.

Before the divorce was finalized he has split custody of me and my brother and we live in a crap apartment that was just a year away from getting demolished for health code violations. Black mold in the ceiling, and broken appliances that backed up with sewage water making the place smell horrific 24/7. On top of that my dad lost the plot, daily baratements for the smallest things, a lack of food that I could eat (I would cook him meals though I rarely got to eat any of it), always high or drunk (sometimes driving me when under the influence), and neglect. It got to the point where I stared to sleep in the closet because I was so scared (It didn‘t help that my brother and I had to share a bed). Eventually I couldn’t take it any more and I broke down in front of a teacher and CPS was contacted.

CPS did jack shit (shocker) and I was returned back to my father for the worst time in my life. He let it slip, (while screaming at my for 2 hours) that quote: ‘the only reason I cheated was because your mother wanted you. I never wanted a second kid, I cheated because of you. You put so much strain on the marriage and me. Your mother and brother could have lived a normal life if it wasn‘t for you.’ That really hit me.

I can’t say this enough he KNEW I was suicidal, I had gone to a psychiatrist scored the worst on depression and anxiety tests, my psychiatrist SAID himself that I was at high risk to commit suicide. Though my dad said that I couldn’t be suicidal because of where I lived and how he treated me well. Despite this I had been returned early to my moms the week prior because I told her I wanted to commit. So he KNEW what he was doing.

After he screamed himself hoarse he let me go to my room where I later attempted. Half way through my attempt mom found out what I was trying to do and tried to pick me up, my father refused and locked me in a room until the police were contacted. He then let me out because it was a bad look to lock your daughter in a room I guess. Then made me cook dinner for him while I was sobbing relentlessly while he lectured me for going to my mom and saying that once again I couldn't be suicidal. In the end I was taken to the hospital and had a stent in there it was very helpful and made me realize how bad the last couple of years had been. (Side note I wouldn‘t have gone if my father had no food, it was the only thing I really cared about at the time.)

At this point I hated my father. I would sit there in scrubs and he would complain about work and the fact that I shouldn’t be in there because everything was fine. My mom started the process to gain more custody and when I was released I only had to stay a couple more days at my father’s before he lost full custody. One day every weekend was the norm and all party’s agreed but my father. He complained that it would be inconvenient for him to drive from his girlfriend’s house back to his home to see me so he chose 2 days a month instead. (His girlfriend of 9 months).

The first time I wnt to see him after the custody change. I was met with another moment of hell when I was trapped for 8 hours being screamed at for trying to take t-Rex shaped salt and pepper shakers. Saying it was like I didn’t want to see him anymore and blaming me for him losing custody. It got so bad by the end of the day I was back in the hospital for a week because I attempted again once I got home to my moms. He finally fully lost custody and can‘t contact me. All of this brings me to now.

My brother is graduating soon so family is coming to visit and my grandma want me to see him again. I am really unsure of what to do now because I don’t want to hurt her by outright refusing though also I don’t want to see my dad again. I am also unsure of weather or not she knows the full situation, but she is also not a good person. Shes a narcissist who enables my father behavior. She’s coming in a couple of weeks and I am super nervous to meet her, and I don’t know what to say.

(Oh and my dad hasn’t improved at all if anything he’s gotten worse, he now trades weed for sex from prostitutes, is a chronic cheater and liar, has had domestic violence charges put against him by several women, and currently is in a dire financial situation.)",2,2,1745310462.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k51abh/my_grandmother_wants_me_14f_to_talk_to_my_father/

I’m super tight w/ my parents. We spend lots of time together. This issue is more about them being out of touch. We’ve never had these probs:

Pretty sure I’ve had scabies for 8+ months (obvi burrows during mo. 1-4). ZERO clue how I got it. Despite this, every derm has dismissed my concerns as just my eczema. I still feel that something is wrong. All along, my parents have agreed, but denied that it could be scabies (blamed on disease rarity, eczema, mental health, stress levels, good hygiene, allergies etc.). This is worsened by the fact that I’ve already seen 4 derms w/ no conclusive scabies diagnosis. I need to convince them that I may truly have this condition & that they’d need to treat along w/ me. If they don’t, I’ll never get better & they’ll be at risk. 

If I can get them to understand, we can handle it as a fam. No idea what to do. Welcoming all perspectives. Thank you.",2,17,1745296457.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k4xvn2/i_need_to_convince_my_parents_that_i_have_scabies/

He was drinking today. A lot. While he was ""at work,"" he thought it'd be a good idea to go get a beer. Then another, and another, and so on. I(15) fucking hate him for it. He's always a been an asshole, but drinking makes it so much worse. And that's not even the biggest issue. So, my stepmom has to put up with his shit too, and i have 3 younger siblings (8,9,11) and we live with my stepmom's mom, who, by the way, fucking hates me. So my dad has issues, and i understand that. He grew up in a bad household, and all that. But that doesn't mean you treat your family the same way as you were treated. He also doesn't like the fact that i'm fem, so there's that too. But anyway, he's verbally and emotionally abusive, and when he's drunk, sometimes physically. He's always been. And he also won't get me help, or counseling, or anything, even though i've tried to talk to him and my stepmom about my mental state, but he just won't do anything. He also doesn't like me having much of a social life. I've tried dating, hanging out with friends, etc. but he always tries to pressure me out of it. He's manipulative. So today, we got in an argument about his drinking. I told him to fuck off, and he said it back. Oh well, i couldn't give a shit. But then he decided to act as if i hurt his feelings (which i hope i did, he needs it) but when i told him that i should've, he just got mad again. And i don't know what to do, but my stepmom's on the verge of leaving him, but she can't because she can't get a job, and she's about to have another child, and i'm freaking out because i don't know how much longer i can deal with this. I've also fucking relapsed (sh) so that's fucking great. I'm not even asking for advice, i just needed to vent. There's so much more i can talk about but i just can't rn.

1k4qdhl,my sister hates me and stopped talking to me,mentalmania1329,"hey y’all, i’m 21F and my sister is 19F. We’re sisters and she’s my only sibling btw. Growing up we had an angry mom and complacent dad— we weren’t super duper close in middle and high school and had different friends, but still would hang out every now and then (got closer as we got older). Fast forward to college, we were pretty close and would hang out often, even if we ended up going to different colleges. I’m in my senior year of college now. In Fall 2023 when I was a junior, we had a fight but a month later we ended up going on a family vacation, and all throughout 2024 everything seemed fine. Until December 2024. I had noticed she was distancing herself from me and acting different or would barely want to hang out when I asked— so I confronted her and asked her why, or if there is anything I did wrong. I was so confused. She blew up on me and listed 25+ things she doesn’t like about— all stuff I didn’t know about— things like “you talk to much”, “you’re too much”, “i never liked hanging out with you i’d always act fake i wasn’t actually happy around you”, “i don’t feel like telling you stuff about my life.” I was shocked because it was all out of no where and I didn’t know she had this resentment. For some context, I’ve always been the more “outgoing” sibling, I would go out with my friends often. She has always been more reserved, and sarcastic. I never tried to change her personality or force her to open up at all. I love my family and always put family above everything. So when she blew up on me and basically told me she hated me, and that I’m the reason her life sucks, it really hurts. I was the one constantly checking on her, asking about her life, trying to make plans once a week, asking her if she wants to come to things, sending her messages, etc. She never put any effort. Again, I never complained about this because I always thought it’s cause she struggles with some depression (I struggle with my own mental issues but more anxiety, and she just had a more reserved personality. Fast forward— After she blew up on me last December, saying she doesn’t want to spend time with me, I stopped reaching out to her cause that’s what she wanted. She hasn’t talked to me since then or reached out which I’m not surprised. I’m graduating college next month and I got a new job offer, she didn’t even reach out to congratulate me. Parents tried to talk to her but she doesn’t care, and my parents just told me to ignore it. She’s moving back home for summer break in college in two weeks or so and I’m terrified because I won’t be moving out that soon even though I start my job, I’m gonna be moving out later in the year so I’ll have to survive her living at home this summer till August. She visited once this semester when I was also at our Parents home and ignore me entirely even during family lunch, talking only sarcastically toward me or passive aggressive remarks that are rude. I don’t know what to do and I’m so scared for the summer. I’m afraid our relationship will be lost forever. The ball is in her court since she’s the one who initiated the distance and I’ve already tried everything I could. Please help!! I don’t know how I’ll get over this.

1k4qacn,So i'm 14 and i watched porn,ElaraOliva,"Yeah ik how that sounds, i'm hypersexual because of poor screen time control, i hate but at they same time i love it, for context for the story, i'll tell u smth, i had a girlfriend who turned into a bf bc he is trans ftm, we spent a year and four months together, we broke up 2 months almost three ago, i loved him and he loved me, i knew that.
The thing is that i was searching his dead name in my dads and moms Whatsapp bc i was curious on what they thought, i seached ""Mons"" and i scrolled up, and found their talk about the porn, that i made dildos out of hot silicone and that i still watched porn, YES i'm ashamed, YES i tried to leave it, but i reslly failed in multiple times, i have a friend, he is a year older than me, we will call him 'M', M was my friend for a couple years, then he loved away, then we reunited less than a year aho and we talk almost every day, he knew my bf and supported me through the break up, he also watched porn and the ""self pleasure"" thing, like me.
Now i gotta explain that i CONFESSED to My mom that i watched porn at 12 years old, she promised to not tell my dad bc i didnt feel confortable with telling him yet, and she went behind my back to tell him, i know she is keeping me safe but until now, i thought my dad didnt know ab the porn bc he never talked to me about it.

1k4m9x2,Should I reach back out to my dad?,,"So, if you look through my post history, you’ll see I’m a bit of an asshole. I’m F29 and it’s taken me until the last few years to really take responsibility and accountability for my life. And while I have now accepted that it’s my responsibility, I still acknowledge that it’s my parents that set me up for failure. In light of everything, i decided I wanted to give an honest go at repairing the relationship with my parents and was successful with my mom. I’ve reached out to my dad and he asked to wait a bit but I have not heard back from him. I’m questioning whether it’s the more accountable thing to remind him of our talk or if I should take this as a sign that I should be at peace with the fact that he really doesnt care about me. I decided already that I’m not going to be the one keeping up appearances and chasing after his love and approval. 

**Extremely condensed life-recap for context on me and my dad’s relationship:**
I am the first born of 5 daughters and my dad was an ordained preacher now Catholic priest. My parents spanked and believed in authoritarian style parenting. When I was 8 my parents converted to Catholicism and did not tell us anything other than we were moving schools and churches. Then, when I was 9, we moved across the country so dad could go to catholic school to learn catholic theology. They homeschooled us after that. They never checked in with me about the move. I took it extremely hard and we were bullied by neighborhood kids for being converts. I felt neglected and as I grew older, my dad’s ultra conservatism locked down everything in my life. No video games, no boyfriends, no staying out late, no graphic novels, no music that wasnt Christian, no clothing that was too short, too revealing - you get the idea. Follow, don’t question. He complained I never wanted to share anything with him but I argued that if I did, he would just say everything I liked was bad. I was depressed which led to me being suicidal in my 20s. He did not allow me to grow as a person or explore regular teenage thoughts and experiences. He forced me to go to college where I realized I would not care if he died. I lived with a boyfriend and some friends as roommates (we weren’t even sleeping in the same room) in my 20s and when he found out he tried to make him move out but I finally put my foot down. I eventually moved across the country and maintain extremely little contact.

Overall, I feel like my dad never listened to me, never cared what I had to say, and always believed that he was doing the best thing for me according to his religion. One time I even told him I wished he wasnt my dad and all he said was “I’m sorry you feel that way.” This man rarely apologizes, never takes accountability, and does not reward you for doing the right thing if you made mistakes along the way. I don’t have a lot of nice things to say about him because I resent him. All of the good things he did for me will never be enough. I grew up always thinking I was a bad daughter for hating him because he was doing the right thing and I was the wrong one. Now that I’m taking control of my own life, I’m trying to find the line between “this is what a mature person should do” and “this is just what you’ve been conditioned to do”. 

If anyone needs more context I can elaborate below. Succinctness isn’t my strong suit. ",1,0,1745263735.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k4m9x2/should_i_reach_back_out_to_my_dad/
1k4m7qn,Father is a leech and I am stuck in the middle.,WillingAd7910,"Full disclosure, my dad is a good guy. We get along with many things, he's good to talk to about more sensitive topics and all that. However, he lives with me and my grandma, has for as long as I can remember with some sparatic periods where he'd leave.

  
Now living her, he is 59 years old and disabled but even prior to this, he has given my grandma grief. She is by no means the nicest and has a sharp tongue. Although, she still does for her kids and grandkids the best she can. He has said things that he would spit on her grave, call her all kinds of names and she still let's him live here. It has gotten to the point where she moved a lot of his junk that he hoards in the backyard off to the dump (my Uncle was involved) and now he is saying she is a thief. 

  
My issue is that he has been using my car for nearly a year. He messed up the paint, loaded it with crap in my car and it is just unsightly. He claimed it was not running well and he needed to fix it, being the only one who can drive it because I can't. I'm not loaded with money to get it fixed, and he started using it right before my grandpa was in the hospital, who eventually passed, so him having my car was the last thing on my mind, and I was going into my last semester of college. Fast forward now, I graduated and I have my degree,e and just trying to get on by.  What happens?  He gets into a car accident with my car. He wants me to cough up $1,700 to him to get this truck from MY settlement for MY car he has been abusing. All because my grandma and him cannot get along and he wants to move all his stuff, which my little hatchback can't move, and that truck can. 

  
I am so flustered and fed up with giving him and going along with things, and like I said, this is not something new because my grandma never kicked him out when my grandpa wanted to and used the excuse of being a mother that she couldn't do it. I am having a hard time myself saying no because that's just how she raised me and I love him, but I don't think he deserves a penny from me just because he put ""time and money"" into fixing my car. He only paid me for like 3-4 payments on it recently, keeps using toll roads all the while I have been using my grandma's car to get to work and do what I have to do. At this point it isn't my car anymore. I want it gone, he doesn't deserve any of my money, but I don't know how to bring it up to him. I hate that I am this way, but I guess I wanted to rant and hear others' opinions on it.

1k4jr0l,"I (25F) ghosted my older sister (37F) after feeling emotionally drained. She’s no contact with our family and now I’m caught in the middle, feeling broken too.",ChickenHot6243,"So a bit of context—my older sister moved back to our home country (third world country) ,since she gone to study and work in a first world country ,last year after giving birth to her baby boy. She’s been no contact with our parents for over 10 years now due to some deep-rooted childhood trauma. She went through things with them that I didn’t, partly because of our big age gap—I was born much later and didn’t experience the same treatment she did.

Because of that, she’s always been very clear with me: don’t tell our parents anything about her—where she is, what’s going on in her life, how the baby is. I’ve respected that boundary, even though it puts me in an incredibly uncomfortable position. She’ll ask about them whenever I visit—how they’re doing, what they’re up to—and I always feel torn. I try to answer carefully, but it feels like no matter what I say, I’m betraying someone.

On the other side, my parents constantly ask about her. They still care deeply and want to reconnect, but I lie or give vague answers to protect their peace… because I know if they found out I was in contact and keeping it from them, they’d feel hurt and betrayed. So I end up being this emotional filter for everyone else’s feelings, while mine just get pushed aside.

When she moved back, I tried to be there for her. But the emotional weight of her expectations was a lot. She would always invite me over, regardless of my schedule or energy, and if I couldn’t come, she’d guilt-trip me with things like “we’re family” or “your nephew won’t even know you.” It started to feel less like connection and more like obligation.

She’s no contact with our parents and our other sister too, so I became her only outlet. And the thing is—I’m broken too. I’ve been dealing with my own emotional struggles and had nothing left to give. I didn’t feel like I could say that to her. So... I just stopped replying.

It’s been 9 months now. I haven’t blocked her. I haven’t responded. I don’t even open the texts anymore. She calls me, sends long messages, tries to reach out—but I’ve gone completely silent. And now, she’s been sending me guilt-ridden, defensive messages saying I’ve abandoned her like everyone else. And part of me agrees… but another part of me knows I was trying to protect myself.

How do I come back from this? Should I respond at all? Am I the villain for choosing silence when I didn’t know how to speak my truth? I still care about her. But I also care about my own peace. And I don’t know how to hold both.",3,0,1745257775.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k4jr0l/i_25f_ghosted_my_older_sister_37f_after_feeling/
1k4jodw,Gut feeling turned out right,FastTip4875,"So I (recently 18 as of now female) was on a trip in Missouri when I got a friend request from this guy, we'll call him L. I had a chunk of mutuals with L, including my mom and stepdad, so I didn't think much of it and accepted it. It was about two in the morning when he messaged me, asking how I was. I was nice and said I was alright and asked why he friended me. (I don't remember why but it was harmless). He messages me later, about 11 in the morning. I was asleep bc I was up late and we were in the car for a long time. He messages again around twelve, asking what I was up to. I responded with coming back home. 'Where from?' By this I'm getting a little weirded out but I tell him where. I message my mom at the same time, asking if she knew him. Turns out, he's a cousin of my step dad. I get another message from him asking where home was. I say. He then asks if we'll go through some town on the way. I don't know and tell him as such and ask why. I pause to look at his info. Married, born in like 1979 or something like that. I get a notification from him. 'Can I get a photo of you from now?' Followed by answering my why 'to meet you in person'. I freak tf out at this point. I take screenshots before blocking him. I send the ss to my mom and she tells me to delete and block.

For context, we had a family birthday barbecue and she asked me to take the leftover salad out of my aunt's fridge and I accidentally took chicken instead. When we got home, she was upset about it and I acknowledged that I picked up the wrong container.

The next day, she (at least to me) still seemed upset about the salad and got angry at another mistake i made. I apologised and when she still went on i asked her as politely as I could if there was something i had done to upset her. 

She said that she hadn't seen me before then and didn't know what I was talking about. I mention the salad and she had said she was over it. She then called me to help her with her makeup and when I walked away to get the foundation she said, very loudly, that she couldn't see i was rolling my eyes at her. I did no such thing and as soon as she said that I walked to my room.

I'm trying to save up money to move out and she just tries to make my life hard for no reason. Always trying to get my parents to kick me out  It started when I was like 13 she always have treated me like shit ever since then. She would be physically and mentally abusive to me all the time. I told my parents but they just act like it never happened. They would say stuff like just get over it. I mean I am a forgiving person but she hasn't changed towards me it's always has been this bad. I tried to talk to her several times but she just has this wall up. It's kinda funny because she apologized to me a couple of years ago it was actually sincere. But then she started being the same way again in less than a month time. I have big family as well 5 sisters and 4 brothers my parents been married for a long time. I have strong moral values when it comes to family. I have been here 6 months everytime she would try to argue with me I would ignore it and just move on but now I can't take it anymore I'm at my breaking point. Cuz now she is trying to bully me mentally and I won't allow anymore like how I used when I was a teenager. It just sucks because everytime she does something my parents kinda just brush it off but when I stand up for myself it always a problem. She started recently hiding food in the house that my parents buy that she knows I like to try to provoke me. There is so much more petty shit that she does but it would take me all night.

1k46avk,I really don't want my dad at my graduation but I also can't upset him if I want to go to school,Lost_Wicked_Artist,"My dad has never been there for me since he left our state years ago. He has full access to me and my siblings in terms of contact, but he never reaches out and we gave up on trying to keep up a relationship. When he moved back to our state, he never asked to see us and never once asked to talk to my brother.

He sends us presents during holidays and birthdays (only me and my brother tho, he ignores my older sister which is why I feel nothing but resentment towards any gifts I get or try to hide them from her) and he even forgot my birthdate. He called me out of the blue weeks before my 18th birthday and was genuinely confused when I told him it wasn't my birthday yet. He kept saying how it felt like an important date to him, and it just so happened to be on January 6th that he called, believing it to be an important date like my birthday (I have my own interpretation but take of that what you will)

So now, I'm 19, having been low contact with him for years and he's been asking me about graduation. He asked me months ago and I truthfully did not have an answer, I just said something along the lines about how I didn't know yet and prayed he'd forget. But he's asked again, I directed him to the school website saying how hectic everything is and how all my dates are scrambled up but that the school website should definitely have it. He told me he couldn't find it I essentially just responded ""Aw dang, sorry school redid their entire website out of the blue"" (which wasn't a lie, its made everyone confused about the sudden change) and I just don't know how I'm supposed to tell him no.

Like, this man has not been apart of my life for years and he suddenly wants to be there and play pretend for my big moment? I'm fucking fuming thinking about it! I don't want him or his new family there. But i also can't upset him because he thinks he's the victim all the time!

We kept going home early as kids when we'd visit him because he'd end up screaming and yelling at us every single fucking time, and instead of taking the hint and managing his anger, he instead decided to ghost us, his children, for 6 months and refused to see us at all, not even for our weekly dinners which were generally much nicer than weekends. Anytime he has a falling out with friends, it was always *their* fault, never his. And I'm afraid that he'll do the same thing with me because I still need him for my education.

It's selfish, I know, but it's the only good thing he can give me and I don't want him to be petty and refuse to transfer the bill to me. He got disabled while in the military, becuase he's now disabled and in his kid, I get to have so much of my education paid off and he's already being difficult by refusing to give us the info we need (he just told us to call some number for his information which I'm already scared about because the last time he said that, it was about our dental insurance and we could not get ahold of the right people to get me to a fucking dentist). I have to send in an application to see if the bill is transferred to my name and if it isn't, my father will have to and I can't trust him on these things, especially if he thinks he's been slighted.

I'm at such a loss. Mom keeps telling me to direct him to her but I'm afraid that it's just gonna lead to him asking me to ask her for him and that, if I refuse, he'll realize I'm lying about not knowing the date or wanting him there (which I've never said I wanted him there, but I've never said the opposite)

I'm thinking of telling him the date but making sure I avoid him at all costs, idk, I feel nauseous thinking about it. It's just next to impossible to have a conversation with him over text and I refuse to see him face to face after everything he's done to my siblings and mother.

I have always struggled and have been in and out of quasi recovery. I was doing okay for a long time, but I recently relapsed this past year, and it really affected my relationship with my boyfriend (we’ve been dating for 2.5 years, he’s 29 and I’m 26). He definitely seems to have different goals than me (he’s not that ambitious & fears change, he complains about his financial situation but does nothing to help myself, has depression/anxiety, & was struggling to pay his bills). Unfortunately,
I have a not so great relationship with my own family, so my boyfriend’s family naturally became my chosen family & have been an amazing support system for me. When we were all together, it almost seemed like I had some respite from my ED for once because I just felt such a sense of belonging and loved. I was irritable from restriction, and my boyfriend and I started to both feel increasingly resentful towards each other. He said that I have a tendency to “play the victim” a lot of the time. I often get frustrated because he gets so anxious in social settings & tends to ruin them for everyone involved. He just gets miserable & brings down the mood. He is so out of control if he drinks beer & acts irrationally and can be mean. He thinks that I’m not emotionally supportive, but it’s so frustrating when I’m actively trying to help myself & he isn’t doing his part. He keeps telling me he’s going to go back to school, get healthy & lose weight, stop smoking weed, etc, but it never seems to happen. He was miserable the night of his birthday when we went out to dinner, and I had just had it. I went home as soon as we were done with dinner & that really upset him. I just couldn’t stay there if he was going to continue being miserable for the rest of the night because I need to protect my own energy & it brings me
down. After that, he told me we needed to take a “break” and I haven’t heard from him since (this was in late February). He said we both aren’t In a place to be in a relationship and we both need to work on ourselves. This was over a month ago. Apparently he’s in school right now and doing well. He knows I’m at residential and that I’m on another medical leave from work. I miss him and his family. I used to go there every holiday and celebrate with all of them, and it just makes me sad that I won’t be there with them for Easter tomorrow. I guess im just asking for peoples’ input and advice?

1k42nhx,My brother’s girlfriend is being mean to my mom. What do I do?,ceruleancaique,"My brother met this woman Sara, who is 7 years older than him a couple years ago. She got  pregnant very soon after and moved in with him, so now I have an almost 2 year old niece. Sara has been married twice before and is still legally married. I didn’t meet Sara until she was already very visibly pregnant and my parents met her when they told them the news. This is my brother’s first relationship.

It has been rocky ever since Sara came into the picture.  everyone trying to build a relationship with my brother’s girlfriend who is suddenly the mother of my parents’ only grandchild.  My brother has had to learn to be a partner and father, plus getting to know his partner, all at the same time. My family has a history of poor communication but I can see the effort everyone is making to adjust.  However Sara has been “abrasive” in many interactions (abrasive is how Sara has described herself, to all of our confusion but now seeing it as truth).  

I live in another state, so from afar I have watched the tension rise between my parents and Sara, with little interference from my brother. Even Sara has complained that my brother “never talks.”  The tension has reached a new height after a furious text argument between Sara and my mom. Sara never answered my mom on if Sara needed my mom to look after my niece Abby one day, so my mom made other plans. That day rolls around and turns out Sara expected my mom to watch Abby, even tho she never answered. Sara threatened to withhold Abby from her. Ever since, it has been cold silence from Sara, with my parents still trying to reach out, invite them for brunch etc. Last Friday, my mom’s day to watch Abby, my brother at the last minute told her they didn’t need her that day. 
My mom is confused and upset. I know my mom. She’s been trying hard not to upset Sara. My mom is not pushy or overbearing or rude. She’s an introverted, nerdy, quiet lady (we’re [my family] all a bit quiet) who is great with kids.  According to my dad, she is often “in tears” after talking to Sara. 

I live in another state, so I know it’s all just based on what I’m hearing from everyone, but I’m not sure what to do. I don’t like that someone is being mean to my mom. I’m afraid Sara will do something in front of me when I’m visiting and I’ll go off on her and then none of us will see Abby ever again. I dont want to make things worse but I also can’t tolerate someone hurting someone I love.  How do I handle future interactions with this person?

Note I tried to keep this as brief as possible. Let me know if I can fill in any blanks.

She told my mother that my nieces told her that my cousin tried to grab them. 

I looked up from what I was doing and my sister was smiling. It made me sick so I turned away from her. Then my sister said “He was probably drunk.” Like if that was okay. I stood up and asked my sister where my cousin was, she told me he was probably home from work. So I go up to her and I say “Well he's probably not drunk then.” Then I got into her face to say “This is your daughter.” I walk next door and swung the door open. He had been standing in front of the window when he tried to come up to me to give me a hug.

I stepped back and told him “You ever get near my nieces again I’ll bury you in my backyard.” I didn’t wait for his reaction when I walked out the door. Guess what the MF did? He moved out - all the way back to Mexico. The bastard was that scared. Since he snitched himself out he stays scared… but you’ll never guess what my family did? They were mad at me! Because “I kicked him out.” I didn’t kick him out - I made him a promise.",0,0,1745181252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3vuoi/story_time/
1k3vtj9,Concerned about leaving my younger siblings with my parents when I go to uni,Omnnohmnomh,"To start off, my parents are not abusive, me (17M) and my younger siblings (12F and 10F) have our own bedrooms, laptops, clothes etc. We're well looked after, out parents don't beat us don't abuse us we're lucky.

But that isn't to say things are easy, I've had a rough few years medically and it's made my mum into a bit of a helicopter parent, she's very overprotective, clingy, venting to me about things I should not know about (e.g. wanting to divorce my dad, hating my grandmother, asking me advice on how to parent my sisters etc) and It's exhausting, but she doesn't have many friends and she's so lonely so I've never said anything. And, when I do try to give advice instead of just nodding and agreeing with what she says I get hit with the ""great I'm an awful parent"", so I usually just stay quiet.

My dad works long hours and only really talks to my sisters when he wants them to tidy their bedrooms or go to bed, and is then annoyed when they don't immediately do it.

When my sisters are upset, they come to me. Or my mum comes and gets me to come ""deal"" with them. When my 12 year old sister (just started high school and struggling) needs help with her homework, I'm the one she asks, or again, my mum asks me to help. My youngest sister is autistic, I'm the only one with the patience to sit with her, not to shout at her, not to be upset when she doesn't want physical touch during a meltdown.

I don't want my sisters to suffer because I'm leaving, they don't deserve that. So do I tell my parents to get it together and go to therapy? I've never stood up to them or tried to talk to them about anything like that so I don't know how I'd do it, but I would try for my sisters because I'd hate myself if I let them suffer alone.

***TLDR***: my parents don't like parenting, I look after my sisters emotionally most of the time, and I'm worried about what will happen when I leave for uni in September. Should I tell my parents they need to get their shit together before I leave or is that interfering too much?",1,1,1745181164.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3vtj9/concerned_about_leaving_my_younger_siblings_with/
1k3up43,My family hates me (23yo F) and im afraid of my 8yo brother,Competitive-Ruin-756,"I don't feel protected. I don't feel heard. I don't feel seen. My mom and my dad split when i was 3. I never got to live w my dad but i always loved him. At 3yo my mum moved across the country and we lived isolated from my family. When i was 6 she met my stepfather and they started dating. At 9yo she moved again across the country to his city and i lived there with them for 7 years, till i finally came back at 17 to the city i was born in, to my grandmother's house. At 14yo my mom gave birth to my sister. She is now 10yo. When i was 16 she gave birth to my brother. He is now 8yo. First, when i moved to the big city, to my grandmother's house I thought for a long time i did it because i wanted freedom. Connection to my family. A chance to live without bothering my mom's new perfect family. I was always the black sheep. Now, my siblings are older. I am unemployed and i never could keep a job. When i was living in the big city i was abused and i had to live with that through 5 years, trying to figure out how to help my abuser recover. I was assaulted multiple times. I lost all my friends. People stole my paintings. When i exposed my abuser people called me crazy till he abused another girl. But the label remained. I had issues w drugs. I was committed to psychiatric hospitals and rehab. Someone tried to kill me in rehab. It was a lot. Then there was covid, then i lost my friends so i was confined before covid and after it for a long time i didnt even had a reason to leave the house. On my last job i worked 3 weeks at a restaurant and they never payed me and the boss said ""do you really think i owe you anything?"". So yeah, that demoralized me even more. With all the confinement i was exposed to w internaments and such i started not being able to wake up. Now i came back to my moms house because at my grandmas house everyone is sick and she has a lot of people living there so they can help my grandfather to survive each day. Now in my moms house my siblings are just so mean. They gang up against me. Im pretty sure my brother is a sociopath or something. He never told anyone he loves them, he is obcessed w my moms ass and boobs, he beats us all for no reason. Today he almost broke my nose. When he hits me, i get that abuse cptsd. I try to hit him back because i hate so much to see him thinking he can act all macho man on me and go with no punishment. But then my mom calls me a bitch in front of them, she says im pathetic cause i am struggling w this and she doesnt educate her son. He just hits me in the face multiple times. Sometimes he beats up my sister just to prove that he is strong. But because when i was growing up they used to hit me a lot and then spent my teenage years trying to kms they now have this policy of not hitting the kids. And they gang up on me and if i deffend myself they tell me i lose the reason i had and they call me names in front of them golden children and they thrive on that. I was with my face all bleeding, my brother was laughing. Saying he didnt even touch me. My mom called me pathetic. My stepfather said he would put me out of their house, that it wasn't a place for me to stay because i disturb them. Im too much of a liability. And i mess w the safety of the kids. Ironic, since they always do as they please like the most spoiled brat gen alpha archetype ever and im just supposed to be hit on the face and do nothing. Then i shut down. Then i go into cptsd flashbacking mode and i cant cope w it. I cant even cry because he hit me in the nose and the bone between it and the eye aches. I was putting ice on it, trying to help w all the swelling because my nose changed the way it looked and i wasnt gonna let that vile kid change my face, not on my watch. But my mom looked at me and sighed and sayed ""omg you are so pathetic stop feeling sorry for yourself go do something to help us instead"". I dont feel protected. I dont feel seen. I dont feel heard. They are always playing with my triggers, pretending they are going to punch me so they see me scared. But they are kids so they are always innocent. My grandma laughs when i cry telling her this. I dont know what to do. The other day they left me alone w my brother in the house he grabbed a knife and sayed ""im gonna kill you"". I just grabbed my phone and started filming it. He stopped. I dont know what to do. Help me. How do i deal w this? Ive read that siblings usually pick on the most fragile one, the one they see parents putting to the side but i never hear of examples w the eldest sibling being the one in this position. I wish i was just playing the victim card. Unfortunately im just too traumatized and now my family treats me like a burden and never protects me. I dont feel loved. Then they act like thats stupid. They gaslighted me for years to believe my dad was my stepfather because my real dad was just someone who gave me love but never contributed w money.

1k3tm4h,No family loyalty,Fun_Fact1991,"A little back story. Back in 2012 I had a custody dispute with my daughter's father.  I asked for support after 9 years.  We came up with an agreement but he reniged when I wanted to add in the agreement that we'd revisit the agreement in 3 years.  This is standard for Domestic Relations support orders.  So I filed for support through domestic relations.  A week before our hearing, he had his wife get my daughter from school and not tell me (I was supposed to have her per our verbal agreement). Ultimately he wouldn't let me see her, alienated her from me and I had to file for custody to get her back.  We both experienced a lot of trauma that I am still addressing in therapy to this day.  Current day issues.  My daughter is now expecting her first child.  I threw a baby shower for her last weekend and per her request I invited her dad, his wife, their children, and his in-laws.  I sucked it up for her as I, to this day, do not like either of them or her family for their participation in the trauma.  I have expressed to my parents and sister how horrible I feel when they are friendly with him and his family and act all buddy buddy with them.  It hurts me and makes me feel betrayed.  At the shower, my ex was 2 inches away from me and didn't say a word.  I was fine with that.  Come to discover my sister spending a significant amount of time standing outside, talking to him.  When my mom arrived, she asked if she could say hi to him since we were walking by.  I just responded that my sister has been talking to him forever so she may as a well just say hi to him.  Come to find out later that my mom spent a lot of time talking to his wife and her mother.  I again feel hurt and betrayed by my mom and sister's actions.  I, at this point, feel like just cutting them out of my life.  My dad was there too and was respectful to me and my wishes.  All of them claim they don't like him.  The trauma was so bad that I have asked them if he shot or stabbed me, would they still talk to him?  Well, what I went through is worse and taking a lot longer to heal.  I hosted my family yesterday for East r dinner and if course discussion about my ex and his family comes up.  When we were done eating, I just got up and left the table and started cleaning up in the kitchen. 
I just keep feeling betrayed by the people that are supposed to support me.  In all fairness, they're not very supportive about anything. Would I be the asshole if I cut my sister and mom out of my life?",1,0,1745175013.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3tm4h/no_family_loyalty/
1k3srm7,What’s the best thing to do?,Wiseman_dev,"Hello, guys. I’m going post it here and I’m open with advice and opinions on what I should do, and ano kaya ang magandang setup sa family namin. Thanks po in advance.

Context: 
Nagsimula ito noong nagwork si mother as OFW. Ilang araw pa lang ang makalipas, gusto na ni father na pauwiin si mother kasi hindi niya raw kaya. Si father and grandmother (side ni mother) is nagkaroon ng conversation and it has two sides:

A. According to my father minaliit daw siya at dinuro-duro at isa raw ito sa sinabi sa kanya, “Ikaw, ang sama ng ugali mo, kaya hindi ka maka-alis (makapag-abroad), yung anak ko mabuti kaya siya nasa abroad!”. Witness din si brother sa nangyari ang tumetestigo siya na narinig niya ‘yon. Additional context, nag-abroad kasi si father and na-deny yung application niya and malaking pera na rin yung nagastos doon. 
B. According naman sa side ni mother ko ang naging usapan daw is binibigyan nila ito ng payo at niri-realtalk, isa raw ito sa mga naalala nila na sinabi nila: “May pera ba tayo para pauuwin siya, wala naman ‘di ba”.

Ang naging outcome neto is eto ang sinasabi sa akin ng father ko: “Muntik na akong mabaliw, minsan naiisip kong tumakbo sa labas nang nakahubo’t-hubad, buti nakayanan ko”. Ang stand ni father is hindi naman daw kasi siya ang nagtulak kay mother na mag-abroad pero bakit parang sa kanya galit na galit yung grandmother namin. 

That’s one thing but there’s more.

Time passed, si grandmother and one of my tita is pumunta sa house namin para makisuyo para doon magstay si grandmother since si tita ay may pinapagawang bahay na malapit lang din sa amin. Nakita nila yung urn (abo ni lolo, father ni father), and sinabi ni grandmother and tita kung “pwede bang alisin ‘yan” habang nakaturo pa doon sa urn. Walang imik lang yung father ko and hindi siya nagalit that time. Tume-testigo rin yung brother ko na narinig niya nga iyon. 

According to my grandmother and tita, hindi raw nila maalalang sinabi nila ‘yon or if nasabi man nila ‘yon ay sorry raw. Nakausap ko lang sila about diyan few days ago.

There’s more, one time dumalaw si grandmother sa house namin and pinatuloy siya ni tatay sa kabila ng may galit ito sa kanya. My grandmother and my father had a conversation, grandmother said “alam mo ba yung dating manliligaw ni (mother ko) nakapundar na ng (ganito ganyan)”. That time, hindi nagalit si father or walang sinabi na masama patungkol dito.

According to my mother’s side, si grandmother is mahilig lang talagang magku-kwento ng kung anu-ano pero hindi niya raw intensyon na saktan yung feelings ni father.

Any statements na galing sa side ng mother ko is few days ago ko lang nalaman since restricted ako at kami ng mga kapatid ko na pumunta dahil hindi nga okay si father sa side ng mother ko dahil sa mga issues years ago. 

Puputulin ko na diyan dahil napakaraming rants or kasalanan ng side ni mother ko kay father. 

Problem: 
Last day (April 18, 2025), inaya kami ni mother namin na sumama sa kanya para pumunta sa relatives namin dahil holy week. Pumayag naman kami ni brother na sasama kami lalo na ako kasi minsan lang ako pumayag kay mother na samahan siya sa relatives namin. Nakita kami ni father na nakabihis then sinabi niya na ayaw niya raw kaming tumuloy, at kapag tumuloy daw kami is magagalit siya sa amin, kung gusto raw ni mother na tumuloy mag-isa ay siya na lang since galit nga si father doon sa side ni mother dahil sa mga nangyaring issues and hindi lang ito yung time na pinagbawalan niya kaming pumunta sa mga relatives namin, it’s been more than a 1 year or 2 since yung last na punta ko sa side ni mother dahil ayaw kong mapagalitan ako ni father kasi ang dating sa kanya neto is bakit kami pupunta sa taong nanakit, nangmaliit, nang-alipusta sa kanya, bakit kami makikisaya sa kanila. So bilang pagpapakita ng respect sa father namin, hindi kami sumama kay mother, ang ending is tumuloy si mother mag-isa. Tapos habang naiwan kami sa bahay inabot ng apat na oras yung rants niya about sa side ni mother at nakikinig lang kami kapag nagsasalita siya patungkol sa bagay na ‘yon.

Fast forward, dumating si mother 8 PM or 9 PM na ‘yon ng gabi, and my father confront my mother, ang sabi ni father, bakit inaaya raw kaming magkakapatid na pumunta doon sa relatives namin na walang pahintulot niya, dapat daw is ipapaalam sa kanya at ‘wag daw siyang i-bypass at magsasabi sa kanya sapagkat may karapatan daw siya sa aming mga anak niya dahil may authority daw siya. Nakaharang naman ako kay father habang nagsasalita siya kasi alam kong possible na saktan niya si mother. Sinubukan niyang saktan si mother ngunit inawat namin siya, sumigaw si mother ng “tumawag kayo ng pulis!” habang umiiyak siya. Naawat naman namin si father and nilayo namin siya kay mother. After ng nangyari, hindi pa rin natigil si father na magsasalita ng mga hinanaing niya sa side ni mother at kay mother na kesyo unfair daw si mother sa kanya dahil hindi raw siya pinagtanggol sa pamilya niya, na kesyo bakit sa kanya matapang magsalita si mother pero sa pamilya niya, wala siyang boses na sabihin yung mga pinaggagawa kay father. Nagpatuloy din siya sa pagmumura and nagbanta rin ito sa buhay ni mother, ito ang mga sinabi niya:

“Magpapatawag ka pa ng pulis, papatayin kita bago ako makulong gago!”
“Gusto mo partidahan pa kita, kumuha ka ng kutsilyo diyan nang magkaalaman tayo ngayon, kapag nahawakan kita babaliin ko leeg mo!”
“‘Di ako magpapatalo sa’yo gago!”
“Impyerno tayo dito!”
“Hindi laging nandito ‘yang mga anak mo”. 

Nagpa-blotter si mother sa barangay yung mismong gabi din na ‘yon at doon muna siya nagstay sa mother niya. 

Side note:
Sa loob ng 13 years na nasa abroad si mother as OFW ay okay naman si father, hindi siya nagloko, nambabae, wala siyang bisyo, nasa bahay lang talaga siya most of the time and okay naman siya sa pagraise sa amin, sa pag-asikaso sa amin, he thought us well naman, he wants us to be independent, he wants us to be successful para raw hindi kami matulad sa kanya at hindi raw namin sapitin yung sinapit niya which is inaalipusta at minamaliit daw siya ng side ni mother dahil wala siyang trabaho, etc etc. Mabuti naman ang mga sinasabi ni father na need namin maggive back sa mother namin since si mother ang nagtaguyod sa amin. Ang ayaw ko lang is kapag nagagalit siya at nag-aaway sila ni mother kasi laging naoopen yung problems and issues sa kabila, lagi niyang naipapasok ‘yon. 

Additional context: 
Even before kapag nag-aaway si mother and si father, hindi nagpapatalo si father. Isa rin ‘yon sa mga sinasabi niya na bakit siya magpapatalo sa asawa niya e babae lang ‘yon at lalaki siya, siya dapat ang masusunod, magpasakop dapat si mother sa kanya kasi ayun daw yung nasa Bible. May time rin na nag-away si mother and father noong bago pa lang silang mag-asawa and pinalayas ni father si mother habang buntis si mother kay panganay. 

Noong maliliit pa raw kami sabi ni mother hindi raw kami pinagbubuksan ng gate ni father dahil galit ito, nakakaya raw nito na tiisin kami kapag nagagalit ito. 

So basically may anger issues si father and nasa lahi nila ‘yon kasi ganun din yung mother niya and mga kapatid niya. Even silang magkakapatid is matatapang din e. 

Sana matulungan ninyo po ako kung anong dapat gawin and anong setup ang magandang gawin sa family namin, and ano po ba yung mga karapatan namin bilang anak, ano rin ba yung mga karaparan niya bilang father, and ano rin ang karapatan ng aming mother.",1,0,1745172740.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3srm7/whats_the_best_thing_to_do/

Nothing I did was ever enough. Not my grades, not my friends, not my clothes. Not my weight, not my career, not my attitude, not even my laughter. You wanted me to be a version of you- molded, meek, manageable. Someone you could control. Break. Rebuild.



And when I didn’t comply? You called me a prostitute. Because I wore a short skirt. Because I liked alcohol. Because I said no. Because I finally fucking said no.



You called me irresponsible, indisciplined, a disgrace- But really, I was just living. Living a life that didn’t bow down to your expectations. God forbid a woman be wild, be independent, be free.



You ruined my shot at a good education. You crushed my career before it could take flight. You clipped my wings and then blamed me for not flying. And now that my friends are settled, soaring, you look at me with guilt-laced pity, As if I chose to be stuck. I didn’t. You stuck me here.



You say there’s no love left. You're right. Because what you called love was just control in disguise. And how can I love someone who makes me feel so unsafe?",2,0,1745164203.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3pjrw/an_ode_to_my_family_or_whatever_you_want_to_call/

1k3ld7u,How to not be a child anymore?,papper_flour,"I (25f) have a difficult relationship with my family. They always said i was very mature for my age when I was young. I was always a good, unproblematic child before I turned 18 I never caused any issues. 

After I turned 19 I moved out and the narrative changed completely. I went to uni, started my studies and instead of respecting that I have my own choices to make, they constantly belittle me and my views. They never went to uni, but when I try to say something related to my studies they say 'I'm too young to know anything'. I'm also too young to know about love or relationships. 

I was catholic before I left, but after some time I decided I don't belive anymore due to hypocrisy and overall lynches on people with different views. I can't even tell them, because they say i got manipulated by others and I lost my assertiveness (my moms words). She says I must belive, and she doesn't care. 

After 3rd year of my studies I fell mentally ill. Panic attacks, depression, constant pressure, social anxiety and a few other things. My mom is hiding these, so no one other than her and my brother knows. 

In the mean time I got a boyfriend, who is the kindest soul I know. Sometimes I feel like he's the only one who loves me for who I am and the only one who knows me and wants to listen without judgement. 

Two years ago when I got sick my mother wanted me to come back home, but I refused. This topic goes back and forth from time to time. The issue is I don't even have my room anymore, we are poor and it would be very complicated for me to go back and I'd lose my Independence. Not only financial but also mobility i'd have to ask everytime to have my own money. 

I know this because that's how it looked like during lockdown. I can't go back to this because I'm already in bad shape mentally, because of lockdown. 

This Easter I stayed alone, because if I went home I would fall apart. Still, mom called me yesterday and she said I'm desperate to be wife so I gave up on everything else.

The reason? I don't talk to her about anything important to me exept of my relationship. Her constant criticism and not allowing me to make my choices caused me hiding things from her, because I feel invisible to her and the rest of the family, she doesn't listen, interjects when I talk. 

The truth is I try to finish my studies and I work my ass off to avoid coming back home. No conversation helps. When I'm back home I feel like I should not tell anything, because she asked me to hide or if I tell anything controversial she gives 'the stare' trying to silence me or she gives me lectures when we're alone. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I need calmness and therapy, but she wants to lock me home, ignoring everything I say. When I was young she always told me 'Since you live under my roof, my rules stand, when you on your own, your rules stand'. 

How to handle this? What to do to avoid cutting contact? How to make them acknowladge me as an adult? Anyone has any experience and knows how this feels? How to stop being child? ",2,0,1745151783.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3ld7u/how_to_not_be_a_child_anymore/

I'm living with my mom kasama dalawang kapatid niya lola ko stepfather and bunso namin. 18 ako magstart nako mag work dahil nawalan kami ng income(carinderya) so i decided to stop my studies at nag work ako para makatulong ako sa mama ko para makapag aral ang mga kapatid ko. Sadly isa lang ang nakatapos dahil nag asawa yung dalawa. Ginawa ko naman lahat ng klaseng tulong lahat binigay ko para di lang mahirapan ang mama ko, bilang anak masakit nakikita na nahihirapan ang mama mo (may trabaho naman ang stepdad). Ang nagappagalit at nagpapakulo ng dugo ko sa araw araw na ginawa ni Lord yung dalawang tyahin ko na dalaga na walamg ginawa kundi unahin ang panglalalaki nila kesa asikasuhin ang obligasyon nila sa nanay nila (lola ko). Lahat pasan ng nanay ko specially bills na kapag kinakapos ang nanay ko sakin naman lumalapit na hindi ko naman matanggihan. Nakahiga maghapon yung isa gigising kakain matutulog ulit. Yung isa naman pakakainin yung lola ko sisigawan naman at pag nakakakuha ng pagkakataon uuwi don sa lalaki niya at iiwanan yung matanda dito. Marami kaming Financial Struggles na pinag daanan ng mama ko na kinayanamin pareho kahit wala ang tulong nila. Yung alam nila nunga panahon na yon na walang wala kami sige pa din ang asa nila.  May maayos akong trabaho at yung partner ko na sobrang thankful ko na kahit anong paghihirap di ako iniiwanan. Pero akala yata nila porket may maganda akong trabaho e nakakapag savings kami sa totoo lang WALA! nagtheteraphy yung bunso ko 3x a week nag aaral yung panganay ko. Tapos yung dalawang tyahin ko pag di naibigay yung gusto magsasalita ng masama, na lumalabas nag dadamot ako nagdadamot ang mama ko. Nakikita naman nila nagbabayad kami ng mga back log na mga nautang naming mag ina gumagastos kami ng pangkain araw araw. May salita pa sila na tinulungan kami kaya kailangan tulungan din sila. Di pba sapat yung ginawa nila sa nanay kona taga bayad ng mga utang na mga iniiwanan nila sa twing sasama sila sa mga nagiging lalaki nila. Napaka hirap magbayad ng utang na loob sa kanila. Nakakapagod Nakakadrain. May trabaho yung isa pero binibigay lang sa lalaki niya yung pera niya. Ako lang ang kasama nilang pamangkin sa bahay kaya isa ko sa sinasandalan nila pati ang nanay ko.

1k3cdah,my mom is abusive and i don't think she realizes it,jesus_chrust2037,"TLDR - i'm almost 17, my mom is severely abusive, i have ways i can get out for a few hours but no permanent option until i'm 18, i'm unwilling to call CPS because it's not gonna do shit til i'm almost 18 anyways or i'll risk ending up in a more abusive household, so i need advice on how to tell my EXTREMELY irrational mother she's abusing my stepdad and i emotionally. physically safe, mentally strained, everything sets her off but she needs to be told the way she handles things is not okay. 



i (almost 17f) am wondering if anyone knows a way to inform my mother she's abusing my stepdad and i. she's very irrational and only really got this way around 2020, i am no star child at all as i have severe depression and anxiety and some physical health issues so i have a really really hard time keeping up with my homework, hygiene, and chores because of the mental strain and physical discomfort it causes. i do feel shame and i am working on trying to fix it, however i am never going to get out of this mindset if my mother does not stop screaming. she screams, cries, fakes or causes herself medical emergencies, weaponizes her illnesses, insults, threatens to hurt people or damage property, threatens divorce, etcetera. the fights between my stepdad and her are stressing me out to the point i was nearly hospitalized, and the strain from not knowing if i'm going to be screamed at for something is very hefty on my mental health. EVERYTHING sets her off, i've been yelled at for her dropping things while i was in a different room. 

i don't do anything bad really at all besides failing to keep up with my responsibilities which i 100% understand i am in the wrong for and accept accountability for, hence why i'm working on it, but a lot of the time if i or my stepdad do the slightest thing she crashes out. the main thing she gets upset with him for is sleeping, especially because he snores. she calls us stupid, lazy, incompetent, selfish, and even tries to say my stepdad is killing her when she causes these medical emergencies. my stepdad knows she's irrational but i don't think he realizes this is abuse, and i do but i don't say anything directly. if she's being particularly insane i will talk back, however i do not insult her back, i simply point out how unreasonable she's being. i have nowhere i can move to and only 2 friends irl because i'm homeschooled, so i have no way to get out until i'm 18 as i'm barely allowed to go out. even today, i was supposed to see my boyfriend but she slept all day so i was unable to. 

just this year i've been grounded from food, called every insult you could possibly think up, threatened, berated, everything. it's not physical anymore because i started hitting her back when i was 13 so by 14 she stopped, (wrong of me, i know, but she literally kneeled on my neck one of the times she was beating me so i started fighting back), i can't take the mental abuse anymore. neither can my stepdad. she was getting therapy through kaiser but they went on strike and it's gotten worse. i don't want to tell CPS or my school because all that's going to do is get me put through a system where i'm going to either be assaulted or put in a more harmful place a month before i turn 18 so it's pointless. i just want this to stop. i have a year and a half almost clean from self harm and at this point my mental health has gotten so bad i can't even guarantee i can maintain that. i'm so behind in school i truly don't think i'm passing the grade i'm in. 

  
how do i make her stop, appeasement doesn't work, calling her out doesn't work, i'm at a loss. ",2,0,1745115522.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k3cdah/my_mom_is_abusive_and_i_dont_think_she_realizes_it/

He has me for weekends biweekly as I live with my mom and stepfather (that I have known since I was 3). Recently, around 4 months ago, my father told me he was dating a lady for two months. I thought this was great for him since he has spent so many years alone and it’s nice that he found a new love. Issues started to arise when he went to his home country out of impulse for her after only knowing her for two months when he bailed on going there with me and my cousins a few months prior. I guess you can say I’m still a bit salty about this matter. Recently, starting a month ago, he began asking if I wanted to meet her. I tried explaining to him that I’m disinterested in meeting her atm since I feel it’s a bit too soon? I did meet her briefly already at a party my family held but I just said a polite hello and goodbye. She stayed over last night but she hung out in my dad’s room the whole time so I didn’t interact with her then. She complained to my father this morning that I am not “giving her a chance” which has him disappointed in me. I don’t know exactly why I just don’t want to interact with her at the moment, is it because I’m still resentful at my dad, is it because this is a completely new situation for me? Or maybe it’s just because I find no need to interact with new people if there is no need for it? I just want advice on how to tackle these new emotions, and if taking my time to meet her is alright.

1k37pf2,Family hurt,GroceryOk520,"
Its been 3 years since I discovered my mother had an affair, and I still cannot seem to accept things. Firstly, I am a devoted follower of Jesus. His Word says infidelity is wrong, but He also says to forgive. 
   My mother left my father after 45 years of marriage at the age of 66, my father was 70. She said her reason was he had been verbally abusive to her for years and they had not had a real marriage for a few years. I knew he had verbally abused her when I was young, but she stayed with him all those years and I guess I just assumed he had matured and changed over the years. 
   My father was devastated and claimed he never saw it coming and tried very hard to get her to come back to him. She did not and divorced him after being gone almost a year. The good thing that came grom her leaving, was my Dad is now a devoted follower of Jesus. 
    About a month after she left him, my mother started becoming very distant. She started lying to my sister and I. She would go on spur of the moment out of town trips. Not show up to family gatherings, even if our father was not there. She became very defensive with my sister and I. She went from being a loving devoted mother and grandmother to being a selfish person who cared only about herself.
    Long story short, she had a boyfriend in another state. We found out about it, and she expected us to just meet him for dinner, and be OK with everything. She just expected us to be friendly with a man that was involved in destroying our family. 
   My sister has met him a couple of times and can be cordial. I cannot. It is just too painful to pretend like he is a good person. My mother says she loves this man and he treats her good. 
   I completely understand and agree with my mother leaving my father. I witnessed him verbally abuse her. I am glad she got out.
   Its just the way she did things. Lying, cheating, neglecting her whole family. My relationship with my mother is up and down. 
How do I move forward from here with her? I can’t even bring myself to see this boyfriend.",1,0,1745100667.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k37pf2/family_hurt/

1k32qyg,What can I do,Cheddar-loaf-nug,"I’ve been dealing with ongoing issues with my brother for years now, and I’m honestly at my breaking point. The retaliation, manipulation, and refusal to take accountability have caused real damage in my life—emotionally and otherwise. I wanted to share the full picture in case anyone else has gone through something similar.

It started with my mom making a lot of false claims about me—accusing me of things I didn’t do. Instead of asking me about it or trying to get the full story, my brother completely shut me out and refused to speak to me. But behind my back, he went to a mutual friend of ours (someone I was friends with before he even knew her—I introduced them) and told her every bad thing I had ever said about her. The problem is, he had said the same things and held the same opinions, but he pinned everything on me. As a result, that friendship was destroyed. We’re no longer friends, and never will be again. He, of course, still talks to her like nothing ever happened.

He also started telling people that I had an affair with a married man—something that has absolutely no truth to it. He told multiple people and even made a comment about it to me in front of others at a wedding. But when I tried to talk to him about it privately, he said he didn’t want to be a part of “this” and didn’t owe me a conversation—despite the fact that he was the one spreading the rumor and bringing it up publicly.

Then there was the situation with my dog. I was working long hours as a travel nurse and had initially left my dog with our dad. My brother later offered to take care of him, and I agreed. He even asked to be reimbursed for a vet bill—which I paid, and I still have the texts to prove it. But when it came time for me to take my dog back, he refused. He told me I had “relinquished custody” and that the dog was his now, even though that was never agreed upon. I had to go through the legal system and file paperwork just to get my own dog back.

Recently, I wrote him a letter. I didn’t write it to reconcile—I wrote it to be clear. I brought up the wedding comments, the rumor, the dog situation, and the ruined friendship. I also set boundaries: I told him he can think whatever he wants about me, but I don’t want to hear it. If we do have to be around each other, I asked that he not bring things up in public and just keep things respectful. Pretty basic boundaries, I think.

His response? He said that I was “acting like a victim” for even writing the letter.

He refuses to apologize or take any accountability. And I really believe he just wants me to pretend none of this ever happened and go back to normal. But I can’t. It’s been years of manipulation and emotional fallout, and he’s never once owned up to anything. I think the only thing I can do now is go no contact. But it’s hard not be angry about all this.

1k2yk2i,I'm at a loss,weirdobrain2002,"I don't know if I'm going to keep this up or make this a throw away account, but I'm 22 female and at a loss. I apologize if this ends up super long, but I don't know what to do. Recently my mental and emotional health has taken a dive and I don't know what to do.

For context, when I was a child, I lived with my biological mother, I'll call her Susan, and she was minimally toxic, at most, abusive. She'd starve me for her amusement and laugh with her friends when I'd eat like I didn't know when my next meal would be, she (might've, from what I've heard?) forced my biological brother to physically abuse and assault me, leave me in the care of various men with questionable/bad intentions and tell them they could do whatever they wished to me, tried to marry me off to various men on thier death beds to try and claim their life inheritance (then found out it was more complicated in our state and stopped). She would forcibly keep me awake for days on end for not figuring out math problems, and made it clear she never wanted a daughter to start with, just 3 sons. She then ended up resorting to moving practically nowhere and forcing us inside, successfully isolating me and my brother from society. She also forced us, as in my brother and I, to go to various therapists/psychiatrists to get us diagnosed with autism, and when then realized not only we didn't show signs of autism, much less that she was the problem, shed leave them and go to the next.

Because of that, I got various tips and tricks on how to ""control"" my mental and emotional health. I should also add that Susan would also poke fun at my panic attacks and behavior around strangers, much less men, since a majority of therapists and psychologists were male, and I was uncomfortable and scared to talk to them. However a few of them, when I was significantly younger, think 7-10, and my mental state clearly didn't match my age due to isolation and such, told me I had ""very, very, very, very, bad PTSD"" and nervously stated that it might never be put in my records. However, because of Susan poking fun at my symptoms of PTSD and panic attacks, I grew significantly better at hiding them (think panic attacks looking more like horrible anxiety and nonstop fidgeting/stimming).

The problem lies in the fact I can feel my mental health declining and no one seems to see it or understand. Every psychologist I talk to focuses on the PTSD, like that's the only issue I have, and tell me I don't know what's wrong with me because I insist it isn't PTSD, but they won't listen. I basically worked on my mental health alone, against the world since day one, and I even played therapist for Susan and others when I was a child. I try to tell them that there has to be something more then just trauma, but they insist I'm wrong. It feels like the me I was is slowly rotting away, and I'm scared I'll be a shell of my old self. It feels like I'm wasting away and no one is even attempting to help me.

I also live with my biological dad, I'll call him Steve, and his ex girlfriend, I'll call her Hannah. Steve has made it clear quite quickly I can't trust him with personal stuff, and he has a lot of signs of behavioral and personality disorders. The one time I told him something personal, he threw it in my face during an argument and basically made it sound like it was my fault and I was constantly the problem. And even though I want Hannah to adopt me, I feel similarly to her. She's comforting to be around, but if I mention anything about my mental health, she just states that I have to leave my trauma in the past. I don't even have to be talking about my trauma, and yet, she always pulls it up. It constantly feels like she's throwing it in my face, especially since when I escaped Susan's house, I ended up in an abusive relationship with my ex and having a child she's now raising and adopting (it's something we have talked about and will benefit everyone). On the rare occasion, she even mentions my trauma with my ex and laughs about it like it should be a funny joke.

I just feel too exhausted for my age. I know certain disorders and such were thrown around when I was a child, like depression and anxiety, but I don't know what to do. I just recently got my first job (that's a completely different, unrelated thing) and I'm already uncomfortably close to being fired. I constantly feel on the verge of collapse and have intense headaches. And it's not just me getting over being sick, because when I was around 15 I had the same symptoms. I feel horrible, I'm constantly in pain, and I don't know what I should do. Hannah and Steve think it's just trauma and I should power through it like them, but I don't feel like I have the energy to do that anymore. I barely have the energy for personal hygiene and cleaning my room, and I feel like I've been fighting against the world too long. I'm not suicidal anymore, but I'm just too tired. I don't want to die, but hygiene, eating, and even going to the bathroom feels like a chore.

I'm just unsure what to do or how I should go about things. I feel horrible all the time and I don't know how to get it to stop. I'm constantly on the verge of tears/crying myself to sleep. Is there something I should do? Am I wording things in a way that isn't understandable, or am I going crazy? I don't feel like I just have PTSD, it feels like there's something worsening under the surface everyone ignores once they here PTSD, but am I just following in Susan's footsteps? I keep getting told I am by Hannah if I mention my mental/emotional health issues...",2,1,1745075759.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k2yk2i/im_at_a_loss/

1k2vlsc,Toxic mum,zai455,"Just need to scream and vent!

So sad that I now realise how toxic my mum has been all my life……

My younger brother has had a little boy who’s now close to 1.5yrs old. My nephew possibly on the autism spectrum and I’ve been trying to hint to my brother about getting nephew assessed but it’s been difficult to bring up as I don’t see them that often. And I’ve needed to wait till the 1.5yr mark to be sure. 

Back info, I’m an allied health professional working with children with special needs. 

My mum brought it up today and I said I’ve been trying to gage what my brother thinks about my nephew to try and start the conversation. My mum and brother have a better relationship so I’ve asked her to start the conversation with him. 

The bit that got me was when she said, ‘I’ll ask him to go ask a professional’. I’ve learnt self love after having kids myself now and I no longer let people look down on me. I know I’m worth something. I am a professional with over a decade of knowledge on child development who helps diagnose children with  autism. I said to my mum I can assess my nephew if my brother wants just as an informal thing and then they can start the referral process for him. 

I was not going to let her put me down. So many things have happened over the years but not anymore. I’m a strong mama who will not let toxic people step on me anymore. 

Just for any other people whose parents purposely try and upset you and tells you you’re not good enough, don’t listen to them. They’re toxic. Know your self worth and self love.

1k2uxd2,I broke my step brother’s electric scooter,,"I am 28 (F), my step brother (13) came over with his electric scooter and I borrowed it. I accidentally fell into a huge water puddle with it and it broke. I got it to the repair shop and they said they couldn’t do anything. So I told my brother and his mom (we have the same dad but not the same mom) I would buy another one for him. His mother was categoric. She doesn’t want me to buy a new one for him. Her logic is that as a family we should not start with this « I owe you / you owe me » dynamic. She says the scooter broke, it’s fate. That’s it. She says it wasn’t even his to begin with, it was passed down to him by his older brother and she feels like he is spoiled in the sense that because he has so many bothers and sisters we tend to buy him a whole lot of stuff, he had this scooter, a bike, another scooter before that, we buy him expensive clothes etc. etc. She also feels that he is way too entitled, like he will send me or any other brother / sister of ours a simple text like « hey I want this » and literally harass you until he gets it. And it’s usually not cheap stuff. 

She was so firm that I had dropped it and said I wasn’t going to replace the scooter. But my brother keeps sending me scooters telling me that he would like this one or this other one and that I should convince his mom. So I had decided to buy one despite his mother’s opinion, he was really pressuring me and I felt bad because after all, I ruined his stuff so replacing it is the least I could do. However, my mom found out and she is also opposed to it, she also thinks we shouldn’t start putting money between us as brothers and sisters (it’s a cultural thing from Africa, I guess) and she says that she and my step mother are happy we all get along so well despite my father leaving my mom and remarrying and she thinks we shouldn’t start compensating e/o and especially since I already spend so much on my brother. She is like what’s going to happen the day he breaks something of yours and he is 13 ? Will you ask your step mom or dad to compensate you ? 

So she went and told my step mom and my dad I was still buying the scooter. My dad called me and got CRAZY MAD at me telling me not to go against their opinion and what they wanted for their child as parents. 

I told my brother about it and we decided to live at that. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks later. My little brother sends me a message saying « since the parents don’t want you to buy the scooter, buy me this instead. » It is a 80€ Under armour sweater and sweatpants set. 

It’s fat less expensive than the scooter but I still feel like our parents are going to put 2 and 2 together and get mad. His mom has warned me about getting anything else instead of the scooter. My dad has been mad at me for a whole week after the scooter gate. I don’t’ know what to do. Also at first, I was happy to compensate him but now I see our parents POV, my little brother is entitled and I also feel like he has this way of asking for things that we all have indulged and made worse over the years. My brothers and sisters feel like I shouldn’t buy anything and just ignore him because he is becoming a brat. But part of me also feels like I am just being unfair if I don’t 
Compensate him …. I don’t know what to do.

I went no contact and everyone acts like I'm this mental patient that needs therapy and when I did go to therapy, my mother used it like a win for her, to prove she's always been right how I'm just this out of control angry kid. 

I'm 26 years old and I'm treated like a 5 year old. I'm so tired of everyone. I'm tired of hearing oh let it go let it go that's your family you need them. Where were they when I needed them? How can a mother be so confused as to why her grown daughter shut her out of her life completely when she neglected me the entire time I lived with her? 

I don't get why everyone hurts me then acts like I'm being irrational and angry. My family used a letter i wrote to myself, an extremely vulnerable letter as a weapon against me and used it to belittle me and told me i can't be mad at them for it because I decided to write my ""little letter"". They're so insane to me. I don't get it. I had to separate from them and then I get the response oh but that's your mom you need to just let it go just say sorry just move on. 

A mother loves you, protects you, nurtures you, supports you, lifts you up, she did the exact opposite and wonders why her threat to not be in my life is a celebration for me. 

Then everyone acts like I wanted this. I didn't want to feel hate towards my own mother for thinking me saying I wanted to die was a joke. I didn't want to feel no love towards her. I didn't want to be okay with no longer having big sisters. I didn't want to let go of anyone. I didn't want any of this. But I don't want a fake family. I don't want to play the role for them that they want me to play just so things can be in control. I don't want to play chess with every word I say. I don't want to give up my happiness for them. I don't want to hate anyone. I don't want to be angry. I don't want to be alone. I want my sisters. I wanted a mom. 

I wanted my mother. I begged for her, she chose not to listen. She gave me up to her boyfriend and did nothing and acted like she didn't know even though at 3 am when she couldn't find him, she'd come directly to my room asking me where he is. She won't admit to a single thing but she likes to wait until she's alone to call me on the phone to tell me my entire childhood was a lie, I wasn't actually abused, I wasn't actually touched by my father, it was my fault that her boyfriend did because I led him on and it's all fake because I didn't tell her even though I was. Even though when I did, she laughed.

How am I supposed to love her? How am I not supposed to hate her? How am I supposed to feel close to my sisters that left me there? They abandoned me. They didn't come back for me. They didn't check on me, they didn't care. 

But I'm the bad guy. I'm the angry one. I'm the mean one. I'm the negative one. 

It's always gonna be my fault. Forever and ever and ever. It's always my fault. Always my fault. ",2,1,1745036540.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k2o18k/im_really_sick_of_being_the_bad_guy/
1k2mqvd,Am I wrong?,Low-Thanks-4316,"I’ve been staying with my mother, but I don’t talk to her. I’ve been avoiding her, staying in my room, and when I do go downstairs I don’t say anything to her. I know, I know what people will say, “but she’s your mom…” or “I should appreciate her because I still have her…” We just lost my father last year, but it seems that he was the one to put her in check. So far she managed to kick my sisters out, have two of my brothers get into a fight. They still don’t talk to each other. And she is allowing the eldest brother to spend her money on his wife and daughters. Right now they are in China after going to Thailand for a week and a half. 

There is nothing I could do or say to her to make her stop being so naive and yet so bold when it comes to speaking to me. I have done nothing but clean her house, take care of my sister (she’s adopted) and take all her tongue lashings at me. She puts them all on a pedi-stool and me in the gutter, what can I say or do? If I do encounter her, an argument pursues and I’m back to square one. She needs somebody here - that’s for sure - but I won’t stand for her verbal abuse so I stay away.

1k26zmx,There is something wrong with me.....,,"So......this is the first time i post on reddit and honestly......i am quite nervous.....my family is a bit weird......sometimes controlling.....sometimes i am the scapegoat....and my feelings don't matter a lot of the time........but i love my family.....they are not bad people.......but does that mean i need to cave to a lot of their requests?

Ok. Some context.....although that's hard because i don't even know what i want to say....i just want someone to listen ig....

I was born and still live in a 3rd world country (english is my 2nd language btw)...the economy is trashed especially after the pandemic.....but we were never struggling....not much anyway we are upper middle class.....hell we could be considered lower upper class.

My parents are loving and supportive....i have a younger sister that i love....but that doesn't mean everything is fine with the world.

Again....i don't know where i am going with this....i am just....searching for something ig.

When i was young i was.....aggressive....i picked fights left and right since preschool but then....something happened....my parents took me to a behavior correction facility.....and it broke me....i would be punished hard for everything i did wrong even though i was just a child.....they once told me that i am too problematic and will be taken to a work camp in the desert where i would work and contact my parents only twice a week........i still rememberthe look on my parents' faces.....they were shocked and sympathetic towards me but they ""trusted the professionals"" and kept quiet......i balled my eyes out and kept apologizing till my voice dissapeared........to my parents' credit we never went back there
.....but the damage was done.....i became quite after that......i was still in my first years in middle school....and got bullied......hard.....my self esteem broke and since i was a trouble maker before.....no one would believe i was suddenly the victim.......and i was labeled a fake victim.

Surviving middle school was hard.....and i couldn't even fight back.....i decided then that i would never let my parents know about anything that happens in school.....fearing that they would do something again.......something weird happened to me......i was so afraid of fighting and getting into trouble that even if i was bullied and hit I wouldn't hit back......it felt like there was invisible strings holding me back....the fear of the facility lingered in my mind.

I had no friends and i was being bullied and couldn't fight back and no teacher believed me.....i did something....i still don't know how i did it......i became friends with my biggest bully.....he would hit me and i acted like his lackey until we were in this weird symbiotic relationship where i would run him errands in exchange for protection from him....bullying became less frequent after that.

To this day i never overcame the facility's fear.....to this day the invisible strings are still attached.......i am in my mid twenties right now.....years passed.....more than a decade.....but i still feel weak......if only that were all my problems.....

Growing up i found comforts in computers....i wasn't a genius or anything but it beat dealing with humans every day of the week......i would play simple games....mess with the settings and read some forums online.

Needless to say i became introverted, never had a girlfriend or even got close to a female and i only started to have friends in highschool when i switched  schools. 

But i faced a bigger delima.....what did i want to do when i grew up? I had no idea.....i hated studying with a passion....but i was smart enough to read over things once and half pay attention in class and get b on an exam.....it was enough for me.....but not enough for my family.....they wanted me to be better.....tried to force me to study.....punished me when i would try to get out of it but the knowledge wouldn't go into my head.

I choose the most convenient major which was cybersecurity.....i know its weird but without getting into details it was the best option and i did like computers and videos games.....my parents wanted me to find my passion.....but that was too tall of an order for me.....

Throughout the years my parents were controlling somewhat and tried to micro manage multiple parts of my life....including the time they tried to make me go back to therapy......

My mother came to me one day and told me that she is unhappy and wanted to try therapy....i believed her since me and my mother would ALWAYS fight on everything....she always wanted things her way....and all i wanted was to be left alone....to rot in front of my laptop.....she told me that she wanted me to attend....i said no firmly.....but she  wouldn't have it she kept insisting.......i told her i would drive her and wait for her.....but i won't take a step into that office. It wasn't good enough for her she insisted on me joining.

My mother started begging and gave a couple crocodile tears.....only then i caved in.....i hate making my mom angry.....i don't want her to be sad.....so we went to the therapist.....not knowing it was a trap.

When we entered the office i was on the phone.....she yelled and made me hang up.....even though she knew that it was work.....not wanting to make a scene i put my phone away.....and was handed a folder and before i could ask what was it for i was told to fill in my personal information.......a fire was ignited in me i slowly turned my head to my mother for a split second she looked away then glared at me.....the therapy session was not for her.....but for me.....she wanted to get me admitted like all those years ago......

I almost tore the folder but my mom gripped my hand hard warning me not to do anything stupid......i was so angry i was ready to burn the whole place into the f_cking ground.....but i didn't.....the invisible strings were back.....they held on a tight leach.....and so i slowly filled the forms and a little while later we entered.....

The therapist took one look at me and was like ""he is not here by choice"" i was silent on the outside but my body contained the rage of a thousand suns....the therapist started with my mother while i sat there holding my venomous tongue and clutching my hands.....

""What is the purpose of your visit?"" The therapist asked ""my son is introverted and refuses to get help. I want him to be better. He has no friends and spends his day off in bed all day. He has no passion or ambition.....not even a dream.....he looks down on himself and lacks self confidence......"" and so on.....what the therapist said after would make my whole week "".....the problem is with you"" the therapist told my mother.....i looked at him shocked. was someone finally taking my side?!

All my life i was told that the problem is with me when i tried to say that she was controlling people told me that she just wants what's best for me and knows better....even my friends.....when i rold them about my arguments with my mon they would be like ""that's just how parents are"" i was going insane i almost believed that i was the problem......

My mother was stunned for less than a split second then she nods knowingly as if she already suspected ""YOU want him to be better. YOU want him to get out of the house more. YOU want him to get help. YOU want him to have a dream......but does he? When he came in he was mad.....being forced to come here.....but it sounds like he is managing his life at his own pace....he goes to work and have lazy weekends. He calls his friends on discord and play video games......that's totally normal."" The therapist said.....i was ready to grovel and thank him for understanding.

To my mom's credit, she looked like she knew that she was controlling somewhat....although that didn't mean that i was fine.....years of emotional neglected and shutting the outside world out left me in shambles.

I went back to therapist alone....desperate for someone to listen to me and understand me....a couple of sessions later i got diagnosed with depression, add and slight autism.

I told the therapist everything.....how they would blame me for getting sick....how they would tell me i am faking it.....telling me i am just searching for a day off because i am lazy......i almost cried every session.

I told him about me.....about the correction facility....about the strings....about not being able to emotionally connect very well.......about the crushing loneliness that i feel all the time.....about the hallucinations.....

To explain i don't have hallucinations i just call them that.....i feel infuriated easily....but can't act on it.....so i would imagine what i would do to escape or triumph over the situation.....i imaging beating everyone in sight, trashing the place or even standing and shouting to the top of my lungs and harm myself just to prove a point....that i am hurting.....that i am in real pain.

I always wondered what would happen if i just stood up one day and st-b myself.....would they care.....? Would it matter......?

A year passed since i returned to therapy.....and i was seeing  progress.....but not so much....we searched for my passion....but to no avail....we tried to get me to study but not much changed.....i am lacking motivation....and depression prevents me from getting out of bed....i am tired mentally.....and don't know what to do.

1k25q5m,I'm completely ignored at family gatherings and I'm dreading going to another.,Chikki_PenPen,"Hi all. I'll just get to the point. I have been invited to a family gathering that I'm completely dreading given my treatment at the last one. Almost no one but my Aunt will talk to me or include me in anything.  

I'll try so hard to make conversations over and over to one word answers. Some family members actively ignore me by avoiding eye contact completely and refusing to make things comfortable for everyone by just making things 'work' for a few hours at the gathering - like adults would do. They linger in a room w me while I try to break the silence and then leave me there sitting alone by walking out to a different room. They put zero effort in to including me or make me feel somewhat comfortable in their home. They act like they are doing me a favor by inviting me, but cannot hide there disgust of me. My Uncle literally gasped at my appearance at the last gathering (because I gained a lot of weight on my new medication due to severe illness) and continuously stares/glares at me from across the room. 

The best example of their treatment came at dinner time. There were no seats left at the family tables for dinner so I had to sit at the island to eat by myself. I have to force myself to eat because I'm so uncomfortable I feel sick.

I want to be clear here, that there has been no arguments/disagreements/falling outs and I'm an extremely easy going person who is probably too nice after shitty treatment from others. I make effort and am extremely polite. I'm never on my phone.  

These are family gathering that I have to go to. Do any of you have advice on getting through this torture unscathed?  I'll take anything you have got!",2,7,1744985050.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k25q5m/im_completely_ignored_at_family_gatherings_and_im/
1k245xo,Tumor - should I tell her?,HoneyBunny_Boop,"Hi All, I (34yo) am looking for your advice. For the past 4 years I have health problems, each year is bringing at least one new condition (with my partner we are laughing that I won health issues bingo). Three weeks ago I found out that I have a very rare tumor, stage I. In a few days time I will have yet another surgery to treat and remove what needs to be removed and biopsy to found out if nothing spread out. I will have parts of some organs removed and my life will change forever. This type of tumor is generally treatment resistant, if spread that is bad. 

My mother is a very cold person with no empathy. I had very distant contact with her since I left home 16 years ago, my brother do not keep contact with her at all. Even when I tried to work on our relationship and I would tell her something very personal e.g. my health issues and my worries, a whole family and her friends will know about it in matter of few days. She tried to redicul me, tell others how this is my fault and that anyway I deserved it (my health problems). When I changed work place,  as I had this amazing opportunity with 20% pay raise, she told my family that I had to change work place,  as no one liked me and it is impossible to like me. I am even not that surprised,  as she always was open that she has never wanted us. Her anger mostly focused on me. In my childhood she would hit me, call me names and tell me how horrible and worthless child I am. 

However,  the reality is, that I may get worse very quickly if the tumor spread, and unfortunately chemotherapy is not giving much hope. At this stage I am trying to be positive, and hope that all affected tissue will be successfully removed. My life will change completely and I will require scans every 3 to 6 months from now on, but I still may have 10 to 20 years of happy life (statistics for this type of tumor). 

I need an advice what to do? I know that if I will decide to tell her, this will be via text and I will not have any conversations with her. I don't have energy to be judged and that she will make this all about herself and how difficult life she has because of me... but I also don't want to drop this bomb on her without any explanation, as I think this is cruel.  I have so many thoughts and feelings at the moment. She didn't know about my other surgeries and for sometime I was not updating her about my health situation. However, this time is different, as I may not have time to get old.

My husband was military for a while, we had two young kids, and he received an amazing job offer back home that we could not pass up. My dad passed when I was 16, and my mom has been alone since my youngest sibling moved out when they went to college. She offered for us to stay with her so he could start the job and we could save up while he worked both the job he was offered and the National Guard and I went back to school.  

Well, 4 years passed. Between two deployments for my husband and Covid, the housing market sky rocketed. We would have to move at least 2 hours away from my mom in order to afford a house. She was devastated. She asked if we would stay with her, and we said we would pay into a renovation to make the house bigger and more comfortable for everyone. 

For the most part, it's okay. There is definitely ups and downs and issues at hand. Privacy could be better (we all live in ""one big house"" with no separation). She could respect our boundaries more. But the thing I'm grieving most is just having my own home. I didn't want my mom to grow old all alone in this house, she is still young and has so much ahead of her almost 20 years since my dad passed. But I wish I was having parties with friends in my own home without feeling like it isn't really OURS. Decorating how I want. I know these things are not part of the big picture and taking care of family is important, but I'm grieving a life I feel I could have had. I want to learn to just be grateful for the present.

1k1t8lq,Just a rant,defnotaishuu,"So it's gonna be a huge rant of my recent life. This year was full of breakdowns for me due to my studies, family and friends. Everyone in my family is not mentally stable including me. I recently passed my 12th grade and scored a good percentile as they wanted and they are proud. I also gave for mains in second phase just cause i wanted to try it out. I wanted to write it in the first phase but my family didn't care much about it then and now they are expecting good score from it. I couldn't even study much for it as I didn't have time back then and my college didn't even bother to teach the basics of it. When I told them that I'm not expecting a good score then they blamed it on me. They never cared about that stupid exam and now they are pressuring me after knowing my dad's friend's children got  a good score. I hate being blamed and compared to others every single time. 
Tbh my whole family is suicidal. My mother is mentally drained and has no hope is life but is trying to live due to my support. Even though I used to hate her before, now I am understanding the struggles she made which makes me pity her more. Honestly, I was always saying to myself that I just have to adjust for few mlre months so I can move out for uni and live away from my family. But they are making it hard for me and it's mentally draining to even argue back with my family. During my family talks, they talk about me most of the time. My father just said that if she doesn't even get a good mains scoring, she is honestly so useless and not worthy enough to even complete her next studies. Listening to him made me quite heartbroken as he doesn't even have trust in me that I can do it. I devoted my entire life on studies for them and now they do this. They used to say that they will let me join my choice of university. Now they are saying if my score is bad they wouldn't let me go far to complete my studies. They don't even let me talk about the matter saying I don't even have proper sense and that I'm stupid. They act like they know everything better than me. I used to be a messed up stupid insecure girl during my school days and they used to blame me for that and now that I have finally gained bit confidence, they are just trying to ruin it by blaming me for everything. I always used to think that  my dad used to understand me better but he is the one who misunderstood me. I can't even talk about my thoughts with anyone in my family and it's just tiring for me.
I have trouble falling asleep. So, I usually watch a show or read a book during the night. Now they are blaming it on my phone and laziness. They don't even understand me. I know that I'm not the perfect daughter they wanted but I am trying my best for them. No matter what they don't even try to understand me. I felt like giving up so many times but that would just make me look like a stupid coward. I distance myself from my close friends whenever I'm mentally drained so it makes it hard for me to even open up with anyone. Even If I talk about it, they just say that I'm being ungrateful and overthinking. Even though they aren't physically abusing me but the fact that they abuse me mentally which seems so easy for them and it's just immature acting like this while being grown up. They think that crying is stupid and I'm not even allowed to cry. Even though I don't have privacy in my house, it's totally fine cause it's for my won good. But the fact that no one is even trying to understand or trust me in my own life decisions makes me feel so miserable.",1,0,1744939834.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k1t8lq/just_a_rant/
1k1rba7,Tired and Scared,softsweetstarlight,"     My pop passed away back in December and my mom is moving back to California with my niece and two nephews. She also plans on giving the kids back to my sister, so wants us to move in together. I promised everyone I would move with them but the logistics get scarier every day.
       Most apartments (the cheaper ones) won't let me move without having a job (I'll only be able to transfer one job and that isn't a guarantee). My mom did find one apartment but it is $3000 a month ( not including rent) and I'm not sure my sister will be able to cover her half. And honestly I don't know if I'll be able to cover my half the first month since I won't be able to move until a month after, so that means coming up with $ 2,739 for the month of June. On top of that it'll cost me at least another $1000 just to get from Utah to California. 
       I love my family so much, and I really want to be there for them. I just don't think I have the money to do it. I know they'll accept it if I walk away.

1k1qnn7,Estranged Sisters Straining Family Dynamic,MaximumEffort2214,"My sisters have been in a long-term silent feud, and it’s tearing our family apart—especially now that it’s affecting birthdays, baptisms, and our ability to celebrate as a full family.

Years ago, my older sister (J) briefly dated a guy for a few months. After they broke up, my younger sister (S) started dating him. They’ve now been together for about 7 years, they live together, and they have a daughter who is deeply loved by our whole family.

Back when S and the guy got together, J was in a rough place—partying, drinking, acting out. Their relationship was already strained, and it completely broke down. But a lot has changed since then. J has gotten sober, rebuilt her life, and repaired her relationship with the rest of the family. She’s not asking for closeness with S— we want her to be included, and to exist peacefully in shared family spaces. Despite this, S refuses to be anywhere J is. She will not attend any gathering—no matter how big or important—if J is going to be there. And she won’t bring her daughter either.

We do get to see our niece in group settings when J isn’t there, so it’s not like she’s withholding her entirely. But every event becomes a stressful balancing act. If J comes, S won’t. If S comes, her unspoken rule is that J must be excluded. And it’s forcing the rest of us to constantly choose who gets to be included, and who gets left out.

This has now become a serious issue. My brother has a baby now, and we’ve got important events coming up—a first birthday, a baptism, extended family flying in from out of town this summer. Everyone wants to come. But we’re stuck. Who do we invite? If we invite both sisters, only one will show. My parents are refusing to host anything unless both will attend, which has frozen our ability to celebrate as a family. We’re all stuck in the middle of a standoff that’s lasted for years.

I love both of my sisters, and I don’t want to take sides. But the emotional toll of this is hitting me hard. It’s giving me anxiety and insomnia. I feel like I’m constantly tiptoeing through every plan, every visit, every gathering—just trying to keep things from falling apart. And honestly, it’s exhausting. These past holidays we got J, no S and no niece. It was heartbreaking. 

Has anyone been through a situation like this? What do you do when one person’s refusal to even be in the same space holds the rest of the family hostage? Is it okay to stop waiting for full reconciliation and start building something functional—knowing someone might opt out? How do you choose which sister to invite to family events?

1k1pgyc,De qué lado debería de estar?,No_Violinist_4622,"Entonces, mi madre fue una persona que estuvo ausente hasta mis 6 años (aprox) y en ese tiempo viví con mi tía, mi abuela, y mis dos hermanos.
Durante los 6 años que viví solo con ellos y sin mi madre mi tía solo me repetía una cosa “Su mamá los abandonó y se fue porque no los soporta” uuh, fue traumático.

Luego mi madre llegó, cuando ella no estaba, mi tía nos pegaba, nos regañaba o nos insultaba ¿por que? Pues por sus problemas de ira.
Cada vez los ataques verbales y físicos trascendieron hasta que mi madre tuvo cancer, lo cual hizo que tuviese que quedarse tiempo completo en casa, fue un alivio, sin embargo, ya luego, a mi tía no le importaba que estuviera mi mamá, ella solo nos insultaba (pero no nos pegaba en su presencia) 

Ya habíamos tenido peleas, peleas que trascendían, golpes, gritos, policía, como toda familia bastante disfuncional.
Y ahora llegamos a aquí, mi madre ya salió del cancer pero sigue desempleada y ahora es mi tía la que “brinda el sustento de la casa” (cabe aclarar que ella la mayoría de los años dependió de mi mamá)

Vamos a la actualidad, nuestra lavadora se daño, lo cual hacía que alquiláramos lavadoras por semana (ya que somos 7 y la ropa se ensucia sumamente rápido) y a mi abuela le dieron una oferta, dábamos la lavadora dañada + 400.000 COP que podíamos ir pagando por partes… El arreglo de la lavadora costaba 300.000 COP y se tenía que pagar de una, entonces mi mamá decidió comprar la lavadora.
Mi tía se enojo bastante y empezó a tirarle en cara que ella pagaba los servicios y que a veces compraba el mercado, a lo cual mi madre sumamente calmada respondió que era ella quien iba a pagar la lavadora.
Yo solo estaba en mi habitación, pensaba que iba a ser como todas las peleas, solo verbales, hasta que llegaron las 12:05PM (habían iniciado a pelear aprox a las 10:00AM) y no se terminaba, por el contrario, mi tía le ponía más y más leña al fuego, entonces yo me levante de mi cama y fui a la puerta de la habitación de mi mamá… mi tía le estaba tapando la boca mientras ella hablaba y a mi me dio rabia entonces la quite y le dije “A mi mamá no le vas a estar tapando la boca” ya, ella empezó a pegarme a mi, y le tapaba más fuerte la boca a mi mamá, luego tuvimos que separarlas y mi tía fue a bañar a su hijo mientras yo volví a mi habitación…

Luego mi mamá salió y le dijo a mi tía “mis hijos y yo vamos a mudarnos” muy tranquila, pero, la pelea volvió a trascender… solo recuerdo que mi tía le dijo a mi mamá “tus malditos hijos” luego solo escuché como alguien le pego a la puerta, pensando lo peor fui a ver qué pasó, era mi tía, le había pegado a la pared y estaba tratando de pegarle a mi mamá, mientras uno de mis hermanos la agarraba fuerte, y el otro fue a ver lo que pasaba conmigo; Todo fue muy rápido, mi tía empezó a saltar y luego empezó a convulsionar… estaba muy asustada, pedí ayuda, nos ayudaron y ella ahora está estabilizada.

¿Cuál es el problema? 
No se de que lado estar, se que mi mamá estaba sumamente tranquila, ella hablo con honestidad y tranquilidad mientras mi tía estaba tratando de provocarla… pero, se que mi tía carga con sus problemas, con su hijo que tiene una enfermedad huérfana, y con lo de su trabajo, sin embargo mi madre salió de un cancer, de un abuso sexual, trabajaba y se mataba para mantener a sus hijos, a su madre y a su hermana (mi tía) entonces no se que hacer. 
Si, soy menor de edad, por eso no se que decisión tomar, pero, ver a mi madre llorando me desgarra el corazón…


Mamá dijo que nos vamos a mudar después de que al hijo de mi tía le hagan una operación que es el 22 de este mes, si, si me quiero mudar, lo admito, pero, no quiero dejar atrás a mi abuela, y mudarme es eso, dejar a mi abuela, porque solo nos vamos a mudar mi mamá y mis dos hermanos.

Otra cosa, considero que una persona que tenga tantos problemas de ira es capaz de… bueno, ustedes saben ¿no? Es capaz de m4t4r a alguien, por eso tengo miedo de lo que pase esta noche, si es capaz de, con tanta ira, pegarle a su hermana, que por mucho está en desventaja (ya que mi madre es bajita y está muy flaquita por lo de el cancer) viendo eso es capaz de herirla ¿no va a ser capaz de hacer algo más? 
Lo admiro, tengo miedo, estoy desesperada, tengo ganas de irme hoy mismo y no se que hacer…
Claramente me inclino a apoyar a mi madre, se todo lo que ha hecho… pero ¿por que me siento así? Me siento tan mal, ahora escucho cualquier ruido fuerte y tengo ganas de llorar, o no puedo escuchar a dos personas hablándose medianamente fuerte porque siento que volvieron a pelear.

No quiero que le pase nada a nadie, pero si, tengo mucho miedo…

1k1mexk,Wanting to break free from my family,Fiestystrawberyblond,"My family has been a pillar throughout my adulthood, though recently I have realized that me being kicked out as a teenager and forced to live on the streets has made me wonder how good of a family they are. Recently they have been excluding me from family events and when I'm there I'm ridiculed for being single in my early 30's with no children or husband. I worked so hard in my mid twenties, living alone and working full time to put myself through school. I had no help and they ridicule me for getting an education instead of marrying some rich old man and having children instead.
I desperately want children. But I know I must do it alone because I have no support system which is why I've waited. I had a dream that they flew me to a foreign country, stole my passport and phone and abandoned me. It shook me to my core and has made me realize that they don't have good intention for me. My father wishes to use me as a pawn to gain financial leverage through marriage and my entire family ridiculed me for being educated while they are not.
It has made me realize that maybe they haven't helped me ever, perhaps they were just isolating me from having outside influence. Does family really do this to eachother? I would never wish this to my own children. I've worked hard since I was 11 years old to begin building a foundation so my children would never suffer the atrocities I went through myself. Please any insight will help. This is a sensitive matter and I want all sides of insight from all walks of life.",1,0,1744920589.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k1mexk/wanting_to_break_free_from_my_family/
1k1kss1,Sister possibly schizophrenic??,oofwoofyikes,"Hello! So I recently removed myself from my family, as of January 2024. Long story short, my father is a racist, homophobic fascist and wouldn’t accept my relationship and I can’t bring myself to stick around someone who doesn’t support my happiness due to their hatred, and my mother has been abusing pain pills since I was 15 and between the addiction and mental health issues she had underlying, I was over being abused by her. 

My sister (28F), who also uses pain pills (had been in car accident in 2018 and messed up her leg which is why she started, but also I presume shared mutual habit of her and my mother) and I (25F) had a falling out shortly after that year as she kept trying to get me to reconnect with my parents and I had asked her to please respect my boundaries and stop asking for that. She had freaked out on me and ended up blocking me for doing so, before I could even respond really. In September, she had reached out and apologized and she has been pretty okay with boundaries regarding my parents since. 

However, in the time that we were not speaking, she had met a man at work (for context, she is a stripper and has been for years even before the car accident, was told to stop dancing by doctors bc knee would get worse and it has) who was here from Russia on a work visa. My sister had told me that they fell for each other very quickly and even through the language barrier, he was treating her better than she had ever been treated. In what she was describing of him, it seemed like he just wasn’t abusing her which had happened in a lot of relationships in the past, so while I was happy that hadn’t been happening, I wasn’t impressed by him yet. Anyways, by August, they were married. Everything seemed to be going okay from what I was hearing up until about a month ago. 

Now from the brief 2 times that I had been around him, I wasn’t fond of her new husband but I thought I could just be being protective and this random man who my sister didn’t know 6 months ago is now legally attached to her. 

And I also must add in here that my sister and I are very spiritual people, not religiously but when it comes to the universe and divinity and the law of attraction, astrology and numerology and things like that, we’re pretty involved. I find it interesting and practice when I can, however my sister lets a coin flip make most of her decisions, saying her spirit guides control the coin. It’s a little trivial but she swears by it and I’ve just kind of been like “oh okay cool!” While I do believe in clairvoyance and clairsentience and things of that matter and even having spiritual visions come to you, my sister has pushed it as far as her “spiritual downloads” telling her she is the reincarnation of both Beethoven, and after him, Kurt Cobain, and now herself. 

Okay, so my concern now is my most recent conversation with her. She came over my apartment on my lunch break (I work from home) and I had known already that things with her new husband have been a little off lately through a previous FaceTime call but she couldn’t give me details because he was there. 
But immediately when I asked what was going on, she said “well, I’m the terminator and he’s gonna have to go down because I won’t let him ruin the world.” I asked “…okay I’m a little confused can you explain?” 

And she had said that she thought her “spiritual downloads” when she had met this man was to marry him so that he would be saved from “the war that is coming” between his country and ours, but now knows through her downloads that he was actually pre-determined to be a dictator in the war, and that she has to stay married to him in order to keep him from going back to make sure he doesn’t lead to the demise of the earth as we know it essentially. Had gone into politics a little there and said that her husbands astrology matched what would be a stronger dictator than Putin… idk if I’m gonna get flagged for every saying all of this it makes me kind of nervous. Anyways, I redirected and asked her about his issues with her job, something she had mentioned on the phone prior. He now has an issue with her stripping, accuses her of being unfaithful, which is red flag to me anyways because he knew what she did for work when they met. He also has an issue with her and her pain pills, and personally, I agree with him on this as I really do not like that she takes them. But she is taking it as an attack because she is much more functioning than our mother and refuses to admit that she is still an addict, whether she’s better than our mother or not. Regardless, he is suddenly very disproving of her life overall, and she said the more English he understands, and the more Russian she understands, the less they understand each other. 

I asked her if she has talked to her therapist about this, and she said she doesn’t speak to her therapist about her husband because she does therapy virtually, and she is nervous he will hear her talking about him since he now understands more of what she is saying… 
(And yes, I confirmed with her multiple times that she does not feel like he is a danger or threat to her physically.) 

To me it sounds like she’s realizing she may have made a mistake rushing into this marriage for whatever reason, and putting this narrative on it is helping her push off accountability for that mistake. I had told my boyfriend about her “downloads” regarding his “dictatorship” and he brought up that while it’s kind of funny, it’s also really scary that she believes this. Like, bordering possible schizophrenia. She has told me before she will spend days awake at a time because that sleep schedule “works for her” and on her third day of being awake she gets most of her downloads. But my boyfriend had said this really is an estranged thought of her to have and it might be smart to notify someone about this. I don’t know WHAT to do honestly or who to notify. Whenever I go against anything she says even in an opinion way, she gets super defensive still. 

I feel like that was a lot so thank you for getting to the end if you did and I can answer any questions for anything that I may not have made clear. ",1,0,1744916498.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k1kss1/sister_possibly_schizophrenic/
1k1cdm7,Am I being unreasonable?,Expensive_Fun7355,"A few months ago, I (31M) and my wife (36F) got married. It was a good wedding, nice venue, great food, music, etc. In total with everything included, the bill was around 40K. 

Now, the issue revolves around my parents. In this case, they didn’t offer or provide any financial assistance to help with the wedding. Typically I wouldn’t care, as it was my wife and mines decision to have the wedding and incur the costs. However, I found out when my sister (40F) got married over a decade ago, they covered the whole thing. In this case, at the time, it was around 15K. I confronted my father about this and it has led to some pretty bad dynamics. My wife and I have recently had a baby girl and I refuse to let them see her or accept any gifts for her on their behalf. Recently for example, they offered around 10k to start an education fund for her. This has also led to some issues between me and my wife.

Additional background - my wife and I are quite financially well off. We have a NW > 1 million. This is through sound investing since we were both in our early 20’s, gross household income around 320K annually, good pensions, and I invested early in some businesses that took off. This was the basis of my fathers logic for not supporting. My sister and her husband do fine, but from my understanding, they are a typical middle class family. I guess for me, it’s made me develop a bit of trust issues, which has led to anger and a bit of resentment. As an aside, my parents are quite wealthy in and of their own right. My father is pretty transparent with finances and indicated their NW is around 5-6 million. My rationale is he could have provided some assistance since he had the means to, despite my ability to cover the costs. Also, I don’t think I should be “penalized” because of my career, money sense, and life choices.

So, people of the internet, would appreciate your thoughts and comments.

1k11qfx,Am I too selfish??,Wolf-tuta1994,"My husband earns an annual income of $126,091. I am a full-time housewife and also work as an administrative assistant for his self-employed business, receiving a monthly salary of $1,401. However, all of my income is used to pay for car insurance, our two children’s kindergarten fees, and food expenses.
My husband covers the rent and utilities, but I still drive an old car with a broken door, and I never have enough money to buy new clothes—I always buy secondhand. I would like to have a bit of extra spending money and financial freedom. That’s why I’m currently job hunting, either for part-time or full-time work.
However, my husband strongly opposes this. He says it’s unfair if I work, and that he would lower my current salary if I start a new job. I’ve told him that I’ll continue to manage housework, childcare, and school activities as before. But he insists that being a housewife is a full-time job and says that it’s wrong for a woman to work when the man earns enough. He says it will throw off the balance of the home.
He tells me there is still a lot of work to do at home—like weeding the yard and keeping the house clean. He says the house isn’t tidy enough. He even claims that gender equality is evil, saying, “Equality between men and women is Satan.”
Meanwhile, he goes out drinking every Friday and attends boxing gym sessions on weekdays. He does absolutely nothing to help with parenting. He spends money freely while I constantly struggle with financial anxiety.
I just want to have something of my own—something to aim for.

1k0ybb4,Boyfriends grandma gets in trouble with her husband whom is 25yrs younger whenever she helps my BF ou- she helped him other day now her phone is off,Little-Weekend-13,"Here’s the cliff notes.

My boyfriend’s grandmother is very financially stable.  She is married to this guy whom is 25 years younger than her and to be honest…. I don’t like the feeling this guy gives me — it’s just a bad feeling. 

YEA I THINK ITS SUPER SKETCH THAT SHES MARRIED TO A DUDE 25 YEARS YOUNGER….. I smell Scandalous. 

My boyfriend’s grandmother told me that anytime she helps out her grandson (my boyfriend) her husband doesn’t speak to her for DAYS….. gives her the silent treatment. I tried to talk about that with her and she just tried to laugh it off like it was ok and she changed the subject.

So the other day she gave my BF 2 checks.  He was able to cash one….. but not the other.      Bank won’t say why they couldn’t do the other…. They looked the same I thought it was super weird. . He called his grandma and she was seriously dumbfounded when he told her.  She said she had moved quite a bit of money into that account and there should’ve been absolutely no problem at all.  She said  “I have the receipt at home… I will be there in an hour and a half, and I’ll take a look“ she just seemed really puzzled.  

In my mind I’m thinking something is super off here. Like the husband is the reason for the problem the check didn’t go through  and she’s just completely oblivious.  She’s the one with the money in their marriage and she claims she holds the purse strings.

Anyways….. she never called my boyfriend back… So he had to call her the following day a few times until she answered. I’m not really too sure what was said… However, the only thing I was able to take away from their conversation was that she seemed really I don’t care no nervous and distraught  and the husband was angry and  super pissed off at her. Nothing got accomplished.  


So for the past two days, her phone has been 100% off, which is very strange and not the norm for her and there’s no other way to get a hold of her.

I suggested that we do a welfare check and send the police over there and my boyfriend thinks that’s a terrible idea. What’s so terrible about it?? I think it’s a great idea.  When I asked my boyfriend why he thinks that’s a bad idea he said something along the lines of her husband will get all pissy.. I said WELL THATS TOO DAMN BAD!!! MAYBE IF SHE ANSWERED HER PHONE NOBODY WOULD HAVE TO WORRY.  

Here’s what I’d like some feed back on

Growing up with her I thought she may have autism and begged my parents to get her tested but they refused to accept reality. As a child she was very difficult and got all the attention due to her insane tantrums over things like her socks being uncomfortable, people looking at her, not liking her dinner, and ANYTHING I did which pretty much includes existing in the same room. Now she is an adult and still acts like this but ONLY in front of our family, if anyone else is around she acts normal but shy, her school reports all said that she was a very polite girl, meanwhile at home she would be trying to beat up my parents, threatening me with a knife, telling us she hopes we die etc etc. 
3 years ago my parents let her get a puppy after she was begging (terrible idea). Now she barely lets ANYONE see our dog, keeps the dog in her room all day except for walks and dinner. Occasionally she will allow my parents to walk the dog but I am not even allowed to LOOK or ACKNOWLEDGE that the dog even exists or she will throw a tantrum and have a panic attack. I genuinely do not understand what is wrong with her whatsoever. I am not allowed to be in the same room as her without her telling me she wants me to die or anything like that. 
Also, for anyone who’s going to ask “why do your parents let her do this” I’ve talked to them and they will either just completely ignore me or say it’s easier to let her be a fucking horrible person because she never listens to them anyway.

A few years ago I bought one of those Ancestry kits because they were on sale for Christmas and how fun would it be to find out how Irish I really am (redhead). Jokes on me I’m not that Irish and a close relative came up that I had never heard of as well as people on my Moms side. So I called her up to ask if she had heard of someone with the last name that came up. She said oh yeah I had a co worker named that why.

I stopped the questioning right there shut the door and locked it and decided I wasn’t going to think or look anymore on the issue. 


A few weeks later my mom came to my house and word vomited the secret she kept from everyone. She had a second affair with my dad ( I knew of one because he’s my step dad). Apparently she couldn’t let herself think that I could possibly be this other guys that she wanted to believe I was my dads. But she. But she felt to guilty once I took the test. She begged me not to tell anyone for her own selfish reasons. Mostly being that she had a good relationship with my dad and step mom. I refused and told my dad shortly after. This man raised me after they divorced and he had most of the custody. I only saw my mom every other weekend. My dad’s response to the news. He always figured but didn’t care because I’d always be his.

This whole thing has put so much pain on me and so much doubt in my already anxious head. I’ve tried to move one and heal but it wasn’t in the cards.

I got a message on the ancestry site which ended up being nothing but it just made me curious. So I looked into my birth father or what I could with publicly disclosed information on Facebook. Mostly that he has a genetic disorder that took his vision and he has two sons one in which also is legally blind from the disorder.

My whole life I’ve had vision issues and recently they found issues with my optic nerve. So I tried to see a genetics and re see a opthomologist who has referred me to neuro opthomolgy. It’s been since 7/24 that I discovered my birth father had something  and I’m still no closer to answers. I’m scared and honestly just have so much on my shoulders it hurts.

short ver: 
It is really weird when you realize your parents aren't as amazing as when we were kids, haha. Like, the realization that you can't look up to a person any longer because they're just not the kind of person you want to look up to anymore. I am a very loyal person so I have always denied myself of the fact that my feelings of HUGE admiration and respect towards my mom wouldn't change. 


long ver: 

 First of all, I'm sorry I have to dump this here. I feel bad but I have no one to share this with. I have officially lost my respect to my mother. It's scary and weird. She always feels attacked whenever we try to talk things out as a family. She always shouts every time we talk as a family and turn it into a fight and is a very proud ""American blood"" (I can't believe I look up to a karen, honestly cuz she is Asian with a superiority complex just because she has half the blood. go queen I guess?). She never gives me affirmations too. I know, you might say tough love but I told her I don't really appreciate it but she told me ""This is who I am, ain't changing for a kid. Deal with it."" so there's that. It's fine, right? And remember when I told you earlier that she turns every calm talk into a fight? She thinks that I think that I feel superior to them. I don't. I really don't. I look up to her. very much that even I am more scared of her than God himself when I was a kid. And whenever she tells me that ""Oh so you think you're smarter than us now huh"" I always defend and say no. Today, we had a talk about my future. And yes, she turned it into a fight cuz she feels like the question is projected at her when only me and father are talking about it. She was never in. she just butted in. Okay speed up, I realized it. It weird when it suddenly clicked. it doesn't even feel special like liberation or something. it feels empty and like, ""oh man, sad"" kind of empty?? it's weird cuz before, I can't stop crying whenever we fight. Now, I still cry lol cuz she is my mom and I really want to respect her. her actions are just the one removing my respect for her. but now, I can stop my tears. and the tears are already small. I'm glad I'm not affected when she tells me I'm stupid or that if she could choose who to conceive, she wouldn't choose me. things like I don't love you anymore. it hurts, it hurts damn well cuz I've been fighting to keep my admiration and respect for her. telling myself it's actually worth it to respect her. but no, it's not. So, maybe this will be the time I stopped caring. Maybe then I will be free. I have thought about dying too but nah, she tells me I can't die unless it won't cost them. so basically, I can die if it means itwouldb mean no cost for them to pay hahhahahah. I just saw my hands from time to time or my legs cuz honestly?? the emotional pain is so painful, I have to remind myself that there are more painful stuff than being emotionally hurt. And I have to properly saw myself cuz I feel numb to even feel the pain. I kid you not, I can't believe it either. I was very aware of what the hell is going on. I thought if I hurt myself, it would go away, but it wouldn't. I had to do it more times so I could feel pain. mind you, I am a very sensitive person when it comes to any forms of pain, evenca little chili is painful for me. it was scary as heck when you start to feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. so this time, I will not care. I will not focus on negative things anymore. shit can't even die peacefully. HAHAHAHHAHA if I die, can't invite people as well cuz,l then they're gonna have to worry about feeding them for the vigil HAHAHHA anyways maybe I'll work hard just enough so I could die with my own money. maybe then I'll be free. maybe along the way I won't want to die too right?

I also spend quite a lot of time in my own world and can appear quite slow -he also takes the opportunity to poke fun at this, usually when other people are around (I think to show off or get a laugh from others). I don’t think he realises I’m fully aware of what he’s doing, or it could be he doesn’t mean any harm by it, but it’s starting to really piss me off, and I feel quite hurt by it. I’m not very quick-witted to think of something on the spot. I’m initially hurt, then mull over this and just feel anger.

We spend quite a few holidays together with his parents, as they have kindly helped out with childcare so my partner and I can have some time together -I’ve really appreciated this. We’ve just returned from a holiday together, and on the last night he kindly paid for dinner for us all. However, I took a little while to choose a drink, and very loudly, in front of everyone, said, “Nicol-arse, have you made your mind up?!”

I just don’t know what to do. I have told my partner but he won’t confront him. He has told him that I don’t like him kissing me loudly near my ear as it’s painful, and now he purposely plants a very loud kiss right on my ear which has caused temporary hearing loss. So saying something will probably just worsen it. 

Any advice on how to approach this?! My son is also at an age where he may start to pick up on name calling and I want to ensure I’m a good role model for him. This is a very awkward situation.

1k0hcm7,Do I reach out or just accept that I’m not considered family?,Annoyingly_Average,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. 

My husband (36M) and I (34F) have been married for almost seven years. His brother’s wife (let’s call her Kylie) has never liked me and I don’t know why. I’ve done nothing but try and be kind, but she clearly dislikes the both of us. To give you an idea of what the past few years have been like…
- She announced her pregnancy to the family the week we got engaged, yet I wasn’t supposed to be told because I “wasn’t family” (husband, then fiance, said “f**k that”, told me anyway and I just didn’t say anything). 
- When I was allowed to know, I expressed my excitement, and offered to babysit. She told me I would never be allowed to babysit as I have no qualifications for watching children (despite the fact I’m a teacher). 
- She informed me the whole family thought him marrying me was a mistake because we met on eharmony and had only been dating a year before we got engaged. 
- I’m banned from taking pictures with my niece, and anytime I’m with her she watches me like a hawk, as if I’m a corrupting influence or might hurt her. 

My husband’s sister (31F - let’s call her Amanda) and I were close for a while, but she has gotten more and more distant since getting married last year. (Side note: She met her husband on Bumble but that was perfectly acceptable apparently.) I was a bridesmaid, went to the bridal shower and bachelorette party, and we used to hang out now and then. She and Kylie have always been closer, but Kylie and the brother have been together on and off since high school, so I always assumed it was because they’ve known each other longer. 

Amanda recently announced her own pregnancy. Despite the fact my husband and I have been struggling to conceive for five years and are currently going through IVF, we expressed nothing but joy for her news. Yet she has decreed that we are “devastated” and “resentful”. Of course it hurts hearing yet another couple has been successful where we haven’t, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t happy for her, nor would we ever wish our struggle on someone else. I have spoken with her many times long before her marriage and pregnancy, that it is difficult juggling the excitement for another and your own pain/envy, but we agreed both emotions are valid and can be felt simultaneously. At this point, I’m well-versed in that juggle, as almost all of my friends and at least one coworker each year has been pregnant in the years we have been trying. 

The night before I went in for the blood test to see if our transfer worked, Amanda sent out her gender reveal invitation. I immediately RSVP’d with the comment “so excited!”. Unfortunately, our transfer was unsuccessful. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and say it would have been more cruel to send the invite after we got that news, but it’s hard to understand why that was the time to send that out. And yes, even though she never reached out, she knew we would find out the next day. Neither of them reached out to check on me or my husband once we got the news, which also hurt but again trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as I know most people just don’t know what to say. 

Saturday was our niece’s birthday party. Through miscommunication, we were late arriving but still in the window of the party time. No one acknowledged our arrival except my husband’s parents, and Amanda did not speak to or look at us the entirety of the time we were there. If his mom asked us a question to bring us into the conversation, the topic was immediately changed. While we managed to engage my brothers-in-law in some conversation, it was abundantly clear our presence was unwanted. After eating, Kylie and Amanda took my niece to another area far away from us. They loudly discussed all the times they hang out together (we’ve never been invited) and started talking about Easter plans (again we hadn’t been invited). While we do not actively attend church nor are we religious, we always celebrate the big holidays out of respect, so the lack of invitation was purposeful. 

Frustrated and uncomfortable, my husband wanted to leave as soon as possible, so we took my niece inside to give her presents. As she was opening her card, Kylie rushed in and immediately tried to usher her back outside. Luckily, our niece was more invested in opening her gifts, and refused. The moment she was done, however, Kylie hurried her outside. I apologized for being late, saying we spoke to her husband the night before and got a different time than the invitation. She said “You got the invitation and it clearly said 1”. We went to leave, and the only ones the say goodbye were his parents and our niece. Everyone else ignored us. 

This is only the most recent fraction of the story, but the general theme is the same. My husband has been ready to cut them off for awhile, but I keep trying to engage because I think family is important. He’s also dealt with some mental health struggles related to body image and our struggle with infertility, and I hoped his family would be a source of comfort and support. I wrote up long texts to Amanda and his brother, but left them unsent because I feel like there’s no point. I don’t see them admitting any guilt or apologizing, nor do I feel like anything I can do will change their behavior. Do I try to make things right or just give up?

1k0hbh4,SIL hates me? Advice?,DisciplineWeak9766,"I am 23F and my Boyfriend 23M, have been dating for almost a year and a half.
Pretty sure SIL has a problem with me here’s the story/ lore:
MIL loves me, literally 
DIL loves me, also literally (gets upset when I don’t have for help ❤️)
Aunts, uncles and cousins again love me. 
BIL loves me, he cares about my well being and I used to frequently smoke with him and other family members at gatherings (I’ll explain the ‘used to’ here shortly)
BIL wife (aka SIL to make it easy) I think and feel HATES ME.

When I first met her she was pregnant but she seemed super nice but stand offish, which no problem I understand, you don’t know me, don’t trust me etc.
I feel like every interaction I have with her she dislikes me more and more and I think it’s to the point she hates me, and is blatantly disrespectful and disregards me.

When the baby (her 2nd) was born she offered for me to hold him and I explained that I was too scared and I didn’t know how, the family offered to help but I was too nervous and had only known her 4ish months.
Some time later she asked if I ever wanted kids and I said I did, but I wanted to wait till me and BF were married and financially ready… I could tell Immediately she did not like this answer, she shut down the conversation.
More time in the future about 7-8 month mark, I was helping my BF watch the baby and he needed a break holding him, I was more comfortable with the idea so I held the baby. Within minutes I had the baby laughing and SIL noticed I had the baby RAN over and took him from me no explanation. 
BIL now seems to avoid me when SIL is around, but if she’s not around he talks to me offers to smoke joints Ect, BF of course has no problem with this and is really happy to see I get along with his brother.
The other day I found a gift I’ve given her for her B-day in the trash, and saw nothing I given her is around, but everything my BF or the rest of the family has given are everywhere.
And finally there’s some family drama, long story short her Nephew was accused of SA. My BF went to her house (with MIL and DIL) I was at work and she went past everyone to hug my BF and started crying and finding comfort in him. He told me about it. I found this very inappropriate because she should be finding comfort like this with her Husband, and In law parents. 

I talked to my BF and he understands completely what I’m saying but he doesn’t see the same thing I do. He doesn’t defend her actions but he definitely dosent agree with me either he’s being very neutral.

This is just some of the more extreme actions I’ve seen. 
Idk if it’s in my head or I’m imagining it, I know you’re only hearing my side of the story but if I was doing something wrong I feel like the rest or some of the family would have a problem with me, but it’s just her.

What do y’all think? Is there anything I can do to win her over? Do I need to be confrontational?

FYI: I call everyone in law cause at this point me and BF know we are going to get married it’s just a matter of time and finances.

TLDR: I think my SIL hates me cause she keeps doing actions that says she does but no one else seems to see/ witness. Am I crazy? In the wrong? What should I do?

My father is the oldest son and dreamed of having a big home for our huge family and so even hi couldn’t afford it he did it anyways. 
He took loan both from market and bank and do whatever needed to build the house which eventually lead to lack of money for us. 

Me my sis and brothers (cousins ) don’t get quality education. I had to sacrifice my college coz we don’t have enough money for a good clg and had to admit in such a college which jokes around in the name of placement. 

My whole family is bearing this pain from almost 8 years and now this lack of money just making them yell at each other all time and every small topic just leads to a fight. My elder uncle and elder brothers earns too but don’t contribute in loan payouts or anything but only my younger uncle and my father is hustling for paying the dues . 

Now I am stressed my engineering is already going to complete next year and I have done only one internship that too remote which don’t pay me. Don’t know what should I do just can watch them to struggle everyday for their daily small needs.

1k0ap3n,My brother wrecked my car!,Unhappy_Sob108,"I inherited a car from my father 3 years ago. I would always drive it to work, or whenever I went out with friends. Given that it's an electric car, my younger brother always took it out without my permission, to either charge it at his school for free or whenever he wanted to save money on gas. I didn't like him using it, but my parents told me to let him use it and so I had no choice in the matter. Lately the tires haven't been great in the rain. I had an appointment to switch out the tires coming up. He didn't care though and figured it would be fine. He gets into an accident and the car hits the guard rail. He's fine but the car is damaged. I just found out today that the car will probably be totaled. My brother doesn't even care that much and is just excited to get a new car. If I get a new car, I don't want him to drive it at all but knowing my parents, they are going to force me to let him drive it. I also don't know if I can afford paying for the car on my own, but my brother is saying that he would pay for half. Knowing him though, there are going to be times where he can't pay for it or whatever and it will be all up to me. Also, I don't want his money because that means I would have to give up possession of the car to him whenever he wants it.

1k09uyi,I'm thinking about not inviting my dad(s) to my wedding because of my mom,kacidillius,"I (24F) and my fiancee (25M) got engaged last fall. We met when we were 16 and have been together since quarantine/lockdown. We originally planned to do a destination wedding in 2027- something lavish, but after doing more research into prices, we decided to wait until 2030 to have our destination luxury wedding. But we both agreed we don't want to wait that long to actually get married. We recently decided to have a micro wedding in our home state. We're going to rent an Airbnb, have the ceremony there, grill, drink, and just enjoy our village. 
My fiancée and I are very close with his siblings and parents- my siblings and my parents are another story. My parents are divorced and remarried- and if I thought I could get away with just inviting my step parents I totally would. While my dad and I have a really rough history- I'm happy to say we've healed from almost everything and I'm grateful to have him in my life. Ideally, I would be able to have my dad at our micro wedding. 
I don't want my mom anywhere near this first ceremony. I love my mother, and I know she loves me but I've come to realize that her love is conditional and that she does not think very highly of me as a person. This ceremony is going to be intimate and special and I don't think I would even try to forgive her if she did anything to ruin it. My mom and my dad are divorced but are in constant communication. I don't even want my mom to know about the first ceremony because I don't want to hurt her / cause drama and she will be invited to our larger ceremony. 
At first I wanted to invite my dad and just tell him that I don't want him talking to my mom about it, but after talking to some friends they mentioned that it's a big risk. I agree that I'm not very optimistic that my dad will be able to keep this under wraps indefinitely, but I also feel terrible that the only reason I'm not inviting my dad is because of my mom. Also, my step dad raised me and I feel weird about having my bio dad there but not the dad that raised me. But I know if my mom isn't invited my step dad won't come- let alone keep it from her.

I personally faced this issue with almost all relationships in my life.. not just my romantic ones but all the way from parents, siblings to the friends.. mainly due to uncontrolled anxiety.

Now that I am studying psychology and communication, I was able to whip out a solution to actually express those feelings, unresolved issues, something that is bothering me or simply something I wanted to communicate but could not bring myself to do so...

I have designed a way to transforms my raw thoughts into something more poetic and allow me to keep things very gentle but also get the core message across. the recipient also has to put a bit of thought into decoding the core message but it comes across obviously as something that I am keen on sharing and is a bit sensitive about... working better than expected especially with my girlfriend.

1k0749i,I feel like my older siblings are breaking up the family,JonnaKL,"I might have come to realised that i have a broken family. Since march 2024 my older sisters been fighting or rather ignoring each other. It all started with a fight between my dad and oldest sister about a car that my little sister drove (i have four sisters). So my little sister was going away so my dad told my oldest sister she could buy the car, but i would need to be fixed since it hade some problems. But my dad being annoying (and wrong) later sold the car too the another sisters boyfriend just because he thought the oldest sisters boyfriend would complain alot about the car. So of course the oldest sister was mad at dad and dad got mad because she got mad so he sad som harsh things so they no longer speak to each other. He tried to call her back after a while but she wont talk to him. The thing is, the oldest sister lets call her Ava is also mad at the other sister lets call her Lara. Because she felt betrayed by her sister that she would buy the car that was already promised for Ava to buy. But Lara defends and says she had nothing to with it and it was all her boyfriend. Which i thought was weird because they have shared economy, but thats her defence. So Ava felt hurt and took a step back from dad and Lara. And here Lara didnt care or spoke about it more then pointing out how ridiculous Ava was for being mad at her for the car since she says she wasn’t involved. But then, Avas kid birthday coming up and she invited only two siblings out of four and ofcouse not Lara, since Ava still was upset. But this thing really made Lara mad so she is also now ignoring Ava and bringing up all the other things she is annoyed with by with Ava. And Lara is cutting her out of her life, not wanting to ever talk again. She is so mad that she thinks the whole family is disrespecting her, with Christmas coming she was going to celebrate alone because she didnt feel welcome. Mind you that no one at that Christmas party has beef with her, Ava had rsvp long before that she wasn’t coming. But Lara kept on saying, “Ava can come if she wants, i can skip out, if she feel that the family is so important. Idk”. It all started with that stupid car and now its about how both sisters wants an apology from each other. But no one wants to be the bigger person. Ava doesn’t want to be the person that always says sorry since she feels like she always has to do it (oldest sibling) and Lara feels disrespected and wants to cut everyone out without any talk. Lara even said she might leave the facebook family group on fb just because she feels better without it. And again there are people like me, little sister and aunts whom not are involved at all in this. These two were also sisters who called and talked often and Lara would flaunt how close they were. They where at a good place before, with a good friendship. I just don’t understand what to do. I feel conflicted because both sisters talk to me. Im good with both. But it’s affecting Christmas since no one wants to come. And i dont feel like having a birthday because no one is friends and me celebrating my graduation never happened because neither would like to be in the same room together. I know i sound selfish… I really try to understand and respect both sisters but when is enough? Will they never speak again because neither wants to talk it out and apologise? I feel so confused, because it isn’t about some toxic problems or anything thats been going on for long. It’s just this problem of the car that caused it. And maybe i don’t know enough since they are a fair bit older than me. So maybe they have some history to talk out.. idk. I just hate everything to do with my family right now and i just need some thoughts and tips on how to deal with it.

1jzxzte,Stuck between bipolar mother and Narcissistic wife,LavishnessSuch9438,"Stuck between bipolar mother and wife

Hello Everyone 

This is just a vent post 

I am from India and married in an arranged marriage setup, My mother is bipolar and my wife is a narcissist, We all live under same roof 

It feels like I am stuck between two forces brokering a peace deal on a regular basis 
I hope someday I am relieved of this job being a broker, I am trying to detach myself from both of these persons as it is impossible to keep them happy and contended with eachother 

I know I have my duty towards my wife and my mother, I will definitely perform my duties but I am trying to be emotionally detached from both of these persons, They are causing me mental distress, I have developed severe anxious reactions because of my mother's disease and thanks to my wife's narcissistic tendencies it has made my nervous system even more sensitive 

I have to be emotionally distanced from these two human being to desensitise my nervous system and my overall well being 

Thank you for listening ",1,0,1744738683.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jzxzte/stuck_between_bipolar_mother_and_narcissistic_wife/

My husband at the time, and I  met when I was 19 when my son was 7 months old. We married when he was 3. We went our separate ways (divorced) 20yrs later and all of our kids were graduated and out of the house. My now adult son is 32 with 2 children of his own. When my son was little, his biological father came and went with no consistency, and after about 5yrs no contact, I reached out to ask if my husband could adopt him, which meant signing over his rights. He took a day to decide and he said yes. My son was legally adopted when he was 9 - along with changing his BC and his last name to my husband who he has called dad. Fast forward 25yrs from seeing my son, my son reached out to him. I think partly because he was having his first child at the time. In the process he cut me and his siblings off. I’m assuming because he knew it would hurt us. Well, I was just told he is changing his name to his biological father’s name and he doesn’t care how I feel about it. He even changed my grandchildren’s names. Am I hurt? Devastatingly, YES! During his reunification, he cut me off one day which turned into 2 1/2yrs. According to him, I’m toxic and I’ve done nothing but hurt him over this. My son and I were extremely close and his brothers and sister were his best friends. That story has now changed as well. My son refuses to hear the events that happened and my decisions at the time. All he hears is the “bio dad” saying he regrets what he did. So the other side now has a clean slate and I’m the effed up parent. I have not heard from my son until he decided to call and in his words “give me a heads up” and I have no say to it. He says that dad will still be dad and he’ll call bio dad by his first name. All I asked was then why the name change? If dad is still going to be dad. I don’t understand. He said legacy. I replied if you are anyone’s legacy I would think it would be mine. Your mother. Needless to say, names have been changed (as of yesterday) and I’m so heartbroken. Not only for me but for his dad and my other children. 
I don’t know how to do this except let him go. Has anyone else had this happen? It’s my first time on Reddit, I’m not sure how this platform works.  Thanks

1jzt1vh,AITA: Sisters,Crying_On_Inside,"Here's the breakdown: 
We are 3 sisters. 
My 2 sisters live 22 miles from my father.
I live 750miles from them.
My sisters make NO effort to visit my father and stepmother. My father remarried after my mother passed away. My stepmother is a lovely human. So there is no reason for them to treat my father and stepmother as they do. 
I don't visit my father often, just because it is very far away and expensive. We try to see each other twice a year. We do speak weekly. We are very close.

I recently came to visit my father, my sisters know I am here. I have not heard anything from them - they have not asked to see me. 
Honestly, I don't care. It hurts my father though, he wants his children to be close. But I am done trying to be the bigger person and reaching out. 
AITA for not reaching out to them?

1jznhay,Sexual assault within Family,madawgsz,"This is a very long story but I will try to keep it to the point. I really just want to get this off my chest. 

About 8 months ago my (f28) husband (m29) received a Facebook message from my husbands brothers (m32), BIL (let's call him Dave).

Dave says in the message that my husbands brother (let's call him Luke) SA'd his daughter when she was 15 and 16. When my husband confronts his brother, he doesn't confirm or deny the allegations and only says he cannot talk about it over the phone. (We live interstate and talking face to face isn't an option). The only things he tells us is the horrible things BIL & SIL are doing to him. 

For a time, we weren't sure what to believe but Dave's wife hadn't left him despite the allegations and the niece who had been SA'd grandparents were also still in constant contact with Luke. We assumed if they thought something had happened, surely they wouldn't still be in contact with him? There had also been no contact from the police despite BIL saying he had gone to the police.

I had told my husband I would never not believe a girl, child's or women's story if they told me this happened to her, but as this was his brother he was a little less hesitant to lean all in on the allegations.

Flash forward to last week, we found a Facebook post from the niece, claiming Luke's wife, and the girls Nan had been telling people it was consensual and not denying that he had SA'd his niece. Despite them not being blood related, he had been in this little girls life since she was a baby, and 15 is not old enough to consent. This is assault and paedophelia. 

I'm feeling betrayed, as this man is also an uncle to my daughters. I'm terrified to think someone who before this I would have explicitly trusted with my children could do such an awful thing.

Am I crazy for wanting to wrap my girls up in a bubble and never let them leave me? I never want to let anyone stay in my home again. Am I insane for kinda being mad at my husband just because he is related to his brother?

I don't want to be associated with this man in any way shape or form. How are his wife and the girls nan taking his side? 

I'm just so confused, my head is a mess and I don't know how to process anything. I want to hug the niece and tell her everything is okay and I do believe her, but I don't want to drag myself further into this. 

Has anyone else lived this? How do you trust the world again?

1jzlzwd,My aunt doesn't know i know some of her bad secrets,MainHoneydew5082,"Long story short my aunt is one of the worst people I will ever know in my life. She drives drunk, has admitted to emotionally abusing me as a child, those types of things. She is actually mentally ill and most people around her do not realize this. She hides her weird thoughts until she gets paranoid enough to say them (for example, her saying her ""surgeon was out to get her,"" because the surgeon said she needed to stop eating certain foods after having surgery on her digestive tract. )

What's funny is she is not aware that I know very specific things she's done in her life.

1) About a year before I was born my Uncle passed away from epilepsy (his heart stopped during a seizure in an elevator and he was revived but brain dead. he had struggled with his epilepsy for over 6 years at this point). My Uncle left behind his ex wife and his 2 year old son (my cousin) who were both living 400 miles away from him at the time. My Uncle's ex wife had known him about 3 years at this point.
After my Uncle died, my Aunt went crazy. She accused my Uncle's ex wife of murdering him. My aunt somehow thought she killed him through poisoning from 400 miles away. 
What is hilarious is my aunt still thinks my Uncle's ex wife and her are friends even after this happened. 

2) She had sex with her best friends husband (boyfriend at the time) and her best friend still does not know. My aunt and her best friend have been friends for over 25 years and years into that friendship my aunt and her best friends husband hooked up while drunk & agreed to never tell her friend. 

3) While drunk my aunt admitted to doing meth. (we had since speculated that she had been doing meth with her biological family. my aunt is only related to us via adoption)

1jzj2vw,Is it right for me to never see my dad again after this?,According-Ad-3679,"Recently it was my birthday so my dad took me out for lunch to celebrate. My parents are divorced so we have to plan separately when to celebrate my birthday and decided to do it on a sunday because it just worked out the best for both parties. Anyways me and my dad have never really had a good relationship, but i’ve still tried to keep him in my life bcs at the end of the day that’s my “dad.” He just really annoyed me the whole time, his fiance too they talk in a baby voice to each other and it just really pisses me off. They don’t really know me because we only see each other at most 2x a month so they let me pick out my own gift. I chose to go to barnes and nobles because that’s the only store that carries K-pop albums. I’m really ashamed for liking K-pop just because I find it embarrassing… so I chose an album that didn’t give off the k-pop vibe. It was V’s layover album, my dad asked what it was and I said it’s like jazz. He couldn’t accept that answer so then he started to look at the tag and saw it said K-pop. He made me feel like really dumb, and it felt like he was screaming from the top of his lungs that I like k-pop. Before that he asked to hear the song too so I played “Love Me Again” and he said “that sounds like k-pop” with a huge ass grin on his face. Already being irritated and ashamed I told him “Shut the fuck up, omg fucking stop already!” I didn’t yell it I whispered it to him. I get it that parents like embarrassing their kids and egging them on, but he doesn’t know me as a person ykwim. I was even more embarrassed because there was a guy in the same section that heard my dad talking about K-pop. To him it’s not the end of the world, but to me it is. At first he laughed, but then he saw his fiance have her bitch ass face and started to act all tough. In the end we left, and he bought the album for me still asking if I want anything else, like no I don’t want to share any of my interests with you anymore. Anyways we get in the car and he’s like “Never in my life have you ever cussed at me like that, what would make you even want to do that?” In response I said, “I apologized, and no I don’t think it was okay for me to do that, but at that time I felt like that was the only way for you to stop.” 

Btw- me deciding to cut him out of my life isn’t just because of this. My brothers have cut him out already because of his physical and mental abuse I was just hoping he would change. When I was little he use to shame me for my hygiene (not shaving my legs..) and would also try to claim I was annorexic and try to shove food down my throat. Additionally, even now he tells me about how he wants to self exit bcs my brothers don’t see him.. i’m assuming to guilt me to staying with him??
I have the whole conversation recorded so i’m just going to write the transcript, DF - Dads fiance D - my dad and M - Me.
D - Are you serious?
M - Yes I’m serious.
D - You don’t call me, you don’t come around, and you expect me to know that? (reference to know when i’m getting embarrassed.)
M - Okay and you don’t call me either.
D - Yes I do. 
M - Uh, when? You didn’t even call me on my Birthday. (My brother) had to remind you it was my birthday at 5 p.m.!
D - Yes I did.
M - No you didn’t.
D - Yes I did.
M- Just drop me off at my house.
D - that’s what i’m doing.
M - Okay go ahead.
D- You make things like— like dude.
M - it’s not all one sided.
D - Like i’m not the one that cussed at their dad.
M - And I admit I was in the wrong, i’m not saying that it wasn’t wrong.
D - You caught me off guard.
M - You cant admit that you tried embarrassing me?
D- I did not try to embarrass you.
M- Yeah you did.
D - Who was laughing?
M - You were! You had a little smirk on your face !!
D - I’m asking you what type of music it is.
M- Yeah and I told you it was jazz, i’m already embarrassed to like this music because it’s not normalized.
D- What embarrassing— why is it embarrassing?
M - I was just embarrassed, I don’t need a reason to be embarrassed.
D- What’s embarrassing? I’m trying to understand you (I kept on repeating the same thing and he kept on interrupting me.)
M - If you are trying to understand me then why do you keep on interrupting me?
D- Is that music bad?
M- No it’s not bad.
This back and forth keeps on going for 30 more seconds, saying it’s not normalized— oh I don’t get it.
M- I was just embarrassed 
D-What’s embarrassing about it?
M - You can’t read body language??
DF - He can’t.
D- I can’t.
M- *Sigh* You just gotta learn. I’m sorry dad, but stuff like that isn’t normalized. 
D- Why do you buy it? Why do you care???
M- I’m trying to tell you dad, but you can’t even let me finish one sentence. (My speech impediment came out on the last part, this only happens when I have to talk to him bcs he causes me to be stressed out a lot.)
M- It’s just embarrassing, and for you to do that infront of kids my age—
D- Do you know that kid?
M- No, but i’m trying to tell you—
D- Then why do you care?
M- You don’t understand how it is to be a teenager now and days. Stuff like this isn’t normalized (I use to get bullied since 1st grade, even shopping and buying the stuff I like is a huge step for me and for him to throw me out in the ocean like that felt like I was drowning.)
This repeats for another 2 mintues and then it goes silent for a little bit.
D - I just can’t get over the fact that you cussed at me.
M- Well I admitted I was wrong for cussing at you.
D- You broke my heart. You broke my heart. You broke my hea—
M- Well you know what. If you don’t want to forgive me then you don’t have to, i’m fine with living the fact that i’ve already apologized to you. 
D- You broke my heart. You never ever talk to me like that. Ever.
M- Ok.
D- And what hurts me and breaks my heart is that I was clueless about the whole situation.
M- Ok

Silence for like another 8 minutes until he opens his mouth again.
The whole being embarrassed conversation starts again him asking why and me saying the same thing.
D- Who saying it’s not normalized?
M- Omg are you serious? It’s not what people listen to. That means it’s not normalized. 
D-Obviously you care about what people think.
M- I don’t, but I can still get embarrassed. 
D- No you care what others think, obviously it triggered you to cuss me out. Why didn’t you cuss me out?
M- Why didn’t I? Or why did I?
D- Why did you.
M- Because I was embarrassed, I admit I was in the wrong.
D- Because it triggered you!
M- Yeah and you are trying to trigger me even more.
D- No i’m not.
M- Yeah you are.
Repeats 5x
M- Honeslty dad we are getting no where with this conversation. I am just repeating the same points and you are hung up over the fact that i cussed at you and  can’t move on from that like I’ve apologized. 
D- Yeah because you have never talked to me in that way. 
M- Yeah and that’s all you want to talk about. I am trying to get you to understand my feelings while trying to understand you but you kept on going back every 5 seconds.
Silence…
D- You don’t call me or text me on my birthday.
M- Yes I call you, yes I text you. See i don’t want you to be acting that way because out of all your kids I’m the one who sees you the most. Iam the only one who acticvly tries to build a relationship with you, but it seems every time you try to tarnish it.
D - I just don’t understand why you think it’s okay for you to tell me it’s okay to stfu.
M- I didn’t say it was okay!!! Have you not been listening to me the whole entire time??

This is getting really long, but the conversation from here just repeats. My “step mom” gave me a whole lecture bcs she was there too , but she had to scream her usual “STOP BOTH OF YOU!” like who is youuuuuuuu 😭😭😭. I. the end she says “I see both sides, but I was embarrassed because you cussed at your dad in a public setting!!”
I js zoned out from that point on I didn’t engage because from then on my dad was just saying stuff filled w hate.
He was calling me unvreatful, that he made so many sacrifices for me … yeah like quitinf your job to get the smalllest amount of child support was a sacrifice, and he said when I learn to respect him is when I’m aloud back in the house and I said “then I guess you won’t be seeing me.” 
Even after all of that when I left still said “Love you guys” and he didn’t saying it back. Something I’m sure he is going to regret ☠️. He sent me this message but I’m not going to respond. Lowk it creeps me out, I’m 16, not 6 stop calling me your princess. We don’t have that relationship you made up in your head.

I’m sorry (My name), I shouldn’t have acted like it did, I was just really hurt from what you said and I responded in a bad way. I love you. Happy late birthday princess. I’ll try to learn to watch for the cues. You will always be my princess

I will preface that i have not been an easy child. i am naturally rebellious and a very cynical person when it comes to authority. i do not like being controlled whatsoever. when i was in high school, i was struggling with severe depression, anorexia, and severe anxiety. i also was sexually assaulted my senior year of high school by a boyfriend. i was acting out terribly because i couldn’t properly express my self hatred and ended up screaming and fighting with my father. yes things did get physical many many times but keep in mind that i am 5’6 140 lbs at the time and he is 6’2 230 lbs. i would hit him when things would start getting intense and he would hit me back, but there were times he just out of the blue wanted to hurt me physically (and emotionally). one day my family was at my aunts house and i was alone and miserable in a room. he comes in just to start a fight and twist my wrist as hard as he could for no reason till it hurt so bad i screamed. he has called me a disappointment, an embarrassment, a junkie, an idiot, a bitch, etc. i have often cursed at my dad and called him an ass hole but i find the terms he uses much more personal and hurtful. whenever i try to bring it up he deflects and says im the one ungrateful and that he has done so much for me, dismisses my feelings, and takes no accountability. i have often had to apologize for my actions because like i said i was a difficult child so i have taken accountability for all of that and i am deeply sorry for the things i put them through when i was in high school but i was a child struggling with so many things not at the same mental level as them. my father has not apologized once in my life for the things he’s done and said he says the stuff never happened. am i the abuser or the abused?",2,0,1744690585.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jzixej/is_my_dad_abusive_or_am_i/
1jzcmak,Is it okay to ask someone to help with the house chores if they don't want to pay us for watching their kid?,,"This is a throwaway account.

For context, we share a house with my husband's and his cousin's (who we'll call B) grandma. She doesn't charge us anything to live there, she provides everything for us and our families, besides phones, cars, and subscriptions. I help with groceries by using my WIC and savings but it's not a lot, I'm working on my SNAP application. My husband is between jobs right now as he lost his last one because the contract was ending. I am currently in school full-time with a guaranteed job when I'm done. My husband and I have two little girls, both under the age of two, so we're home all the time. B is a single mom to a little girl under two, works part-time at the local mall, she doesn't contribute to the house financially, not even for her kid, as far as I'm aware.

My husband and O have always done house chores, cooking, cleaning, grocery lists, etc. since before B and her daughter moved in and while we both had jobs. We've given up a lot of material items to have space for everyone in the home, what's in our room is all we have (minus the kids dishes and bottles in the kitchen). B doesn't do any household chores, doesn't cook (not even for her kid), has her stuff in her room, the garage, the hall closet, the bathroom, and even in our room. She leaves her kid with us to go party, which I don't mind watching her but she goes out everyday and doesn't come home until three or even six in the morning. When she is home, she tries to have my husband take care of her kid so she can be in the bathroom and her room all day, B never interacts with her kid. When she leaves her kid with us to party (we watch her while she works, for free), she pays us a little bit. 

Recently, she's been talking about how she can't afford to pay us to watch her kid every time she goes out. I told her that I'll watch her kid for free if she helps with a chore or two before leaving, because it's a lot to be picking up after seven people in the house. Her and the grandma weren't very happy about that, B said she much rather have someone else watch her kid for her. I explained that I wasn't asking a lot, just load the dishwasher or pick up the toys, but they still didn't like that.

Is it okay for me to ask B to help a bit before leaving if she wants me to watch her kid for free?",1,0,1744671614.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jzcmak/is_it_okay_to_ask_someone_to_help_with_the_house/

1jzazbj,Partner doesn’t see his kids,Ok_Pineapple_5842,"I (45f) am seeing a guy (45m) who has 3 kids.

There was a long and painful split between him and his ex wife, and his ex started seeing another man, who she thought would be a better father figure to them. About 7 years ago, she bashed my bf online (he lived out of state for work), and when he said something in retaliation, she abruptly cut him off from visitation with the kids, which broke his heart.

All three kids were unplanned (twins and then another result of an ONS a few years later when he and ex reconnected). They came up with a support deal, and he said he was pressured by the ex to sign away his parental rights to all 3 kids. This all happened when the twins were 6. That was about 6 years ago.

We have pictures of the kids hanging up in the house, and I know he cares about them. But I don’t think he knows when or if he should reach out. He thinks they hate him. He did abandon them. But I believe him when he says he thought it was the best way to give them the stable life they deserved. Still, they must be heartbroken that he left them behind. It’s just a mess.

He’s so hurt over this that I think he’s compartmentalized it all and is just trying to live a life where he’s not a dad, and he avoids talking about them pretty much at all. The twins’ birthday is coming up soon, though. Does anyone have advice on what he/we/I should do? Should he leave them alone? Write them a letter saying he cares about them and he’ll be there for them if they ever want to reach out? (That’s my instinct.) Sack up and call them? Would it damage them more to hear from him— would they be better off reconnecting with him one day when they’re older and out of the house and can understand this better?

I’m happily childfree and have little to no experience with this kind of thing.

1jz863m,Boundaries with families and dealing with family trauma,Frooms27,"My husband and I have decided that we won’t attend family events if my sister husband is there.

He is a nasty person. Has cheated on my sister, is an alcoholic, and has sexually assaulted me multiple times when I was younger. 

I have put up with him for years and made myself believe he never assaulted me because of how fragile, sensitive, and defensive my sister is/was. I didn’t want to tear myself away from her or my nieces who I adore. I believed if I told my sister , she would kill herself (because that’s how crazy she was when all of this went down).
So I lived my life like it never happened. 

Then, years later I had children and alllll of the trauma hit me… hard. My hate/anxiety toward him became more and more obvious. I started to realize how WRONG it was, keeping it all in! Finally my mom asked me about it and I broke down. I told her, my husband, and my sister about what he did to me.

Nothing really changed and everyone except my husband just went on. My dad even said “well that was a long time ago and people change”

My hubby was beyond pissed about how my family responded, so We decided we would no longer go around if he’s there. I told my parents and my sister and explained to them how important it is for them to respect my boundaries. 

But my mom makes me feel guilty about my decision a lot, especially around holidays. She loves to remind me how sad my nieces are now that we don’t come around.. this always makes me feel guilty for tearing the family apart. But I had to for my mental health, needed to put my family first. Idk what I’m hoping to get out of saying all this.. just needed to vent.

1jz4cvw,Wife hates our cats after giving birth and is telling me to get rid of them or she’s leaving with our son,Theconsciousmind42,"Hey guys so here’s the situation. We’ve had cats for a little over 2 years already. Started with one and then my wife convinced me to get a second and then I wanted a third because I just wanted two of the same breed. We’ve lived happy with them and then found out my wife was pregnant around July of 2024. Slowly she started getting annoyed with them and one in particular would give us issues like daily poops in the bathtub and splashing water and just getting hostile when having his litter cleaned. We made the tough choice to rehome him and he’s happy with his new family and now we’re down to 2 cats and our 1 month old. 

My wife has been getting more and more annoyed with them saying how they bother her when she isn’t even the one feeding or cleaning up after them. Her only real gripe that I can tell is she’s overstimulated by their presence and the fact they brush up against her multiple times a day which to me is fairly normal for cats. I have put so much time and energy and money into these cats to love them and give them a good life but she’s at the point she said she rather move back to her parents and split custody of our newborn because she hates them now. I asked why she even convinced me to have more than my first cat if she was gonna end up hating them and wanting them out. I explained that much like family, pets can be annoying especially in transition periods like a new born and that you don’t just give up on them because you don’t want to rub them or have them touch you. She simply states she doesn’t care what I have to say about them. She doesn’t care about any of them and she wishes she never got them in the first place. Which to me feels a bit immature. 

I understand post pregnancy she is gonna be very hormonal and every little thing will bother her especially when it comes to animals but I just don’t know what to do. Obviously I don’t want to split my family up over cats but at the same time I care about these cats very deeply and am the sole care taker for them which I don’t mind. They’re very hyper attached to me and to think of the fear they’d feel beyond dropped off to someone’s breaks my heart. Especially after years of watching them grow from kittens. What do you guys think about the situation? I know every one will say rehome the cats because who dumps a family over animals but I just want some perspective here because I just feel I’m at my ropes with this. I want everyone to be happy and I want to have my family and my cats. She’s telling me that I need to make up my mind today and I feel that’s extremely unfair given she sees how painful this is for me and that I had no intention of getting rid of them to a new home. Has anyone gone through this with their partner? If so what do you do to resolve it? 

UPDATE: I convinced my wife to let me keep the cats!!! ",7,5,1744651080.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jz4cvw/wife_hates_our_cats_after_giving_birth_and_is/

1jz0q5o,My family excludes me a lot because I don’t have children,RevolutionSweaty760,"Hi Reddit world,

I am 31 year old woman who is engaged to be married and have the best dog a girl could ever ask for. I have 7 siblings and 5 of them have kids (13 grandkids). The youngest two siblings are still in high school. So you would say I am the odd one out.

My family tends to not invite me to things that are solely focused on the kids. I addressed my frustration in the past and things slightly changed. They tend to do a lot of things during the 8-5 Monday-Friday when I work, so those types of scenarios I can’t make it. I also live an hour away where they all live in the same town. 

Although, sometimes they do things on the weekend I don’t even know about that I could go to. I found out through social media they all went to an Easter Egg hunt I would have loved to gone to. I was just at home. Has anyone gone through this? It just feels very isolating and this would be the second time me bringing this up. I am also getting married this year and I invited my Mom and sisters to my dress fitting and they didn’t even acknowledge it. It really hurt me because I am so happy and so excited I finally found an amazing guy. I was married before to someone abusive and my family is very traditional so I feel like they don’t see it as important since I was married before. 

It’s all really disheartening at times. I try to make everyone feel important and included but I feel like most of my family doesn’t do that for me. I go to all their kids parties and buy them thoughtful birthday and Christmas gifts. I show up a lot for them and I feel like they don’t for me. I plan to bring this all up to my Mom. 

Any advice?

1jz0cg8,SO FREAKING DONE WITH THESE PEOPLE,RealisticDark2344,"Hi all, I am a freshman at a good college for engineering (top 10) and I have an internship at a great company this summer (FAANG+), and my parents still think I'm a lazy, stubborn, piece of shit. 

This weekend they are coming to the nearest city (2 hrs away) to come ""visit me"", (I'm getting in a car and going 2 hrs away to see them). I called my dad last night because we had to discuss logistics. While calling, he mentioned my two events that I have to go to over the summer because I won awards and have to go to the ceremonies and whatever (the place that gave me the award is paying for all of it though.) and he was talking about how stressful it was going to be and how I just shouldn't have even applied (I won tons of money I don't understand why he is upset), and I was like yeah dad you don't need to come though. And he went ballistic. 

usually it is my mom that is like this, but I think they are the same person now. He was like, ""NO"" ""Youre mother and I are the ones that made you great, its just as much of an award to us as it is to you."" . They always pull shit like this, like in highschool it was insane. they definitely care more about looking like good parents than being good parents. Also they are Christians (I do not follow organized religion any more but they don't know that), and they think I am like destroying their image by being ambitious and stuff. This one lady at church while I was there over break was like ""maybe it is time to slow down because how can focus on the lord and find God's ""man"" for you if all you think about is yourself"" (this woman's son has sexually assaulted me and 10 other girls in this church). 

Anyway, I told my dad I had not received any details on the location or time of the award event, and I said that I was the one that put in the work and preserved to be excellent in my field of engineering. He was like ""I don't know if preservere is the word I would use, I would use stubborn. "", then I was like ""well even if its stubbornness it has served me well, but I think its determination."" 

The part that pisses me off the most is that my 20 y/o brother (I'm 18) is literally such a bum, but he can do no wrong in my parents eyes. he goes to college 2 hrs away from home at this Christian school that has a weird accreditation system, he is dating a minor, he has never had a real job, he's an English education major, he spends every weekend playing like 5 hours of dungeons and dragons, but they never give him any shit about anything.

Im just so tired of being labeled to ""difficult"" one. I work my ass off every goddamn day at this freaking school. I win money, and awards, and get insane internships that are paying me more than my dad will make this summer. Dispite all of this, no one is proud of me, no one is happy for me, and my hard work somehow isn't my own. Im so fuckin done. fuck them.  

We are all seeing each other this weekend instead of a different weekend because it is easter and I know my mother wants to get a picture of us all at church as a family being ""good Christians"" . so done with this fucking act. if you're a Christian how about worship your you savior and quit with the act. if you're a Christian how about love your children. 

so done. so tired. i don't want to go this weekend but I think I have to. ",2,0,1744641212.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jz0cg8/so_freaking_done_with_these_people/
1jysidr,Getting fed up with my man child brother,Sudden_Stop5950,"I’m gonna be very vague. I know he browses reddit
I’m gonna start this off saying shit has not hit the fan yet, I’ve been able to keep my tongue bitten. But I’m not sure how much longer I can. 
I, 22 f, live with my parents and 29 yo brother. We both pay our parents the same amount in rent, and live in our childhood bedrooms. We all know the economy is trash, apologies I cannot afford to move out. I have no problem paying rent to my parents, especially since they are getting older themselves and not bringing in as much income. My brother on the other hand has many problems with this, he believes it’s selfish for our father to make us pay rent since we’re “his kids”. Keep in mind my brother also has double the amount of private living space as I do. 
On top of his belief that he is owed free housing, I guess he also believes my mother and I are his personal maids. He will cook for himself maybe once or twice a week, but other than that he has my mom make all his meals, or goes to his old reliable fast food. He never cleans up after himself, his living spaces have turned to a reddit gamers room, and I haven’t seen him do a single dish in a year. Him and I share a bathroom, and never once has he even laid a finger on the toilet brush, all that bathrooms cleaning is left on me, including when he’s to lazy to unclog the toilet and leaves it for me to discover. He leaves stuff lying around all the time, it’s getting to the point I believe it HAS to be malicious ignorance. I could go on and on for hours about little things, and digusting things he does that drives me up a wall. I do understand part of it is me being knit picky since I’m beyond tired of him. I can’t just stop picking up after him, then I would also have to live in his filth. 
There is no way for me to tell him this without him taking it as insulting, and whining about it. Anytime I oppose him he takes it as a personal attack and gets loud. I would go to my mom about it cause she is the family mediator but I feel there’s no good way for me to express my troubles with him without it feeling like I’m attacking her parenting of him. Especially since she enables him constantly STILL. 
My dad seems to hold the same opinions I do on him, and he’s vocal about it. To my brother and to my mom. My brother usually just gets pissed and storms off, then my mom gets upset with my dad and tells him off. It’s a vicious cycle and I’m exhausted by it. I spend most of my time alone in my room if I’m not at work. I literally cannot even stand to be in the same room as him anymore. 
Any advice? That doesn’t involve moving out… I’ve crunched numbers for thousands of hours at this point, it’s just not feasible for me at the moment. ",2,2,1744613096.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jysidr/getting_fed_up_with_my_man_child_brother/
1jynbxo,Just a confused teen asking about morality? I also kinda emotionally dump.,Automatic_Ability_63,"I'm gonna mention Self-Termination thoughts and the threats to and an attempt to revoke my privileges to life by another just a warning, (I tried to not really be descriptive so hopefully that makes it better).

I'm gonna try to make this short and not share a lot of information (really bad at that) since I'm just here to ask a question while I wait for my next meeting with my therapist (about 5 days away). Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place this is my first time using reddit, (made an account not even 5 minutes before starting to write this).

**Background:**

So I just turned 16 and I've been struggling with a lot recently, especially since I'm currently in the middle of trying to break out of something that had almost caused me to finally commit self-termination thinking it as the only answer I felt I had. Now before I did this I had a trip to visit my father and his wife in another state (I've barely known the man till then) and only recently had short week long at most visits recently, and my moms skewed description of him leading me to not want to be with either parent. Now in this month I'd felt safe enough to tell them some/most of what I had been feeling and dealing with, and now were in this legal custody battle situation, and I'm back with my mom till the court date and thankfully she had improved herself in the 3 month I ended up away (so I'm not in current danger).

Now my mom was never physically abusive (never hit me, but got close many times), but my family on her side are very mentally manipulative, and she has some other things that have effected me, especially since 4 years ago when her boyfriend to this day came in to our life she began using what he though was the way you were supposed to treat a growing boy (he had his own problem growing up, but has never been violent to his biological daughter). He never hit me outside of being intoxicated once (or at least I think? (I have bad memory)) but things happened. **I think that's enough?** I want to emphasize this point that he has never been violent to his biological daughter, because I still care for this man and his young daughter as family and don't want to see them split up cause of how strong their relationship is.

**My questions:** I'll try to make this short

* Is it ok for a man in your house to use the excuse that he is afraid of the child who is at this point like 8 inches shorter the him, half his weight, and only started doing jiujitsu on adults a year ago (but I guess did a pretty nasty choke), as an explanation for threatening to revoke my privileges to life and then on the third time attempting to actually do it. (I don't know if I would still be here or have ended up in a hospital if I had been in a different position and not have been able put him in a choke immediately.) **All three times he was intoxicated.** (I'm struggling with a lot on this because hadn't let myself think about it and just tried to go back to living as a family for 2 ish years).
* Is it morally ok for my Biological Mother to still be in a relationship with this man and admit to not remembering and claiming that the time he actually attempted to revoke my privileges to life even though she was the one to separate us and tell me to leave till she came to get me (Not home, at 11pm at night on cost). (were currently separated, me and the man at least)

I'm trying not to get to deep, and currently I'm diving back into my self-termination idealization tendencies since I'm thinking to much so I'm gonna stop here even though I cant remember and didn't ask the question I really wanted to know.

Sorry it's long, I'll try to remember to come back and check on this post, but my main method of dealing with emotional stress is disassociation so we'll see.

1jyhtt1,How can I 26M have a relationship with my father? My mother’s abusive but he won’t see me without her.,Subject-is-Unknown,"My mother is manipulative, and a micro-manager. She is only with my father for his money. My father is now 82 and my mother is now 56, I’m a 26 year old man now and for my entire childhood I was emotionally abused I am still massively affected by it. I spent my entire childhood scared and withdrawn with no friends and only able to leave the house with them or for school. 

Writing this is one of the hardest things i’ve ever done as I have never been able to put into words what she would do.  It didn’t matter what the situation was she could manipulate it so she was a hero, saviour, victim, amazing mother, E.T.C. Anything that would benefit her in that situation. So despite living in fear nobody could ever see it. They all just belittled me and told me my mother was amazing and that I should be more grateful. Even if I brought up what she would do I could never put it into words or it was all so small that it seemed like nothing to them. 
Some examples of things she would do;

Up until the age of 18 she would check on me in the shower/bath and insisted on helping me bathe. 

She used to force me to kiss her on the lips and would get hysterical if I didn’t. 

She used to accuse me of taking drugs if I even sprayed aftershave she’d tell the family I was inhaling it. She would make me ask her permission to use aftershave or roll on deodorant that she then stored in her office under lock and key. 

She controlled what I ate down to having the same breakfast for months at a time even though I hated it. 

She would check on me while I was asleep up until 18. 

When I started having my now wife (currently 26F at the time we were both 16) round she would listen outside the door and made me ask her every time I needed a condom.

She used to lie pathologically about the most random things for example seeing friends behind my father’s back making me lie too. And telling me my father would hate me and divorce her. That she would make it so I never saw him again. 

Silent treatment, blowing up in my face, financial control, she had “her time” and “her days” with me which meant even if I had plans I had to spend it with her. 

She would make me out as a really ungrateful waste of space and that she is a wounded victim to make her seem amazing infront of others.

She would talk about all the stuff she bought (on credit cards and get my father to pay off) for me to make her seem like an amazing person. She would also spend money lavishly on others to boost there opinion of her. 

When my father made me the heir to his will he announced it infront of others. She smiled and made out that it was what she wanted then took me aside and said “if he dies and that will goes through I will sue you for every penny you get. I haven’t satisfied him for 26 years for you to get it all.” This has now been amended (in that will she was still entitled to live in the house till she dies rent free and a large sum of money) 

She would admit to me, on my own, that she only had me to tie my father down. (She forced my father into having me as he was too old to want another child) 

As a little child she showed me a video of a little boy in an orphanage that needed a home. If ever I did anything she didn’t like she would drag me to the car and tell me she is going to take me to the orphanage and trade me in for this boy because he will appreciate everything she does. 

If ever I did anything she majorly didn’t like she would ban me from any electronic devices for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months. Coupled with the fact I wasn’t allowed to go out with friends that meant I was completely cut off from the outside world and had no communication with anyone other than school. 

Up until I was 16 whenever we would stay at my grandmothers despite there being multiple other bedrooms she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her ( no pyjamas) 

When I was 16 I got with my now wife, we went to the same school. At the start of the relationship even she struggled to see what I was on about. My mother welcomed her with open arms, would take her shopping, she almost crafted herself as a mother to my wife who had lost hers very young. My wife fell for this at first. She slowly started to see more and more of my mother’s true self over time. We were massively restricted on time together and were only allowed together when my mother okayed it (she would use that as leverage over me) when we both started at the same collage, we lied about an extra lesson so I could spend a extra bit of time with her during the week, my mother the overly critical person she was phoned the collage and got my timetable sent to her. Once she cross examined the timetables she flipped on my wife like she would with me. She put all sorts of restrictions in place and made my wife out to be the devil even to my wife’s family turning some of them against her.

The time restrictions were massively increased and I was getting harassed and emotionally getting abused to break up with her. We put up with this until I turned 18 packed my bags and got in the car and drove off. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. Feeling sick does not even describe how scared I was to openly defy her for the first time. I was forced to leave the majority of my positions behind (which she still has in my room 8 years later set up, despite my request to receive them) . My wife’s grandparents thankfully took me in till we were on our own feet. Over the years I have tried over and over to see or even speak to my father but everything goes through her. Over the years his entire family has been estranged from him including my older siblings (half siblings on my father’s side) so I have nobody that can relay a message.

 I desperately want a relationship with my father as he was the only person that gave me the will to stay alive for the first portion of my life. Without him been my pillar I would no doubt have kms as a child. He is old now and has been manipulated to the point of becoming a weak old man that does exactly what she says. He no longer has any family only her. Whenever I try to reach out he says that he will only see or speak to me with her there. I’ve written a letter, messaged and we had a phone call. I am still affected by what she did and know it would massively affect me to even see her face never mind speak to her.

 I know I will regret never seeing my father again when he dies but I am having to put my and my wife’s mental health first. He is never not by her side but I’m desperate. Can anyone offer any advice how I can manage this situation? nobody not even chat GTP can give me any advice other than to start grieving him.
Thank you.

Our eyes were stuck to the show as one of the contestants was doing something really cool, then our dad walks in. While me and Chris were casually watching, my dad from out of nowhere blurt, ""OP, they are very good. But they are just not going to win."". I quickly dismissed the comment as I wanted to keep watching. But then he tried to ask the same question again, this time more louder. Me and Chris unanimously said ""Shush"" as we couldn't concentrate. Then dad just snapped. He shouted at Chris to ""DON'T YOU EVER SAY SHUSH TO ME, IN MY HOUSE!...I HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK"". From that point it became a shout off and even mum got involved, defending dad and accused Chris of being rude. When Chris tried to get it across to dad that his comment wasn't necessary, dad just flat out unplugged the tv and took the remote away. I tried to be the middle ground and trying to tell everyone to calm down and let it go. Chris listened and apologised for shouting, but still made it clear that dad's comment was uncalled for. Dad just gave him the cold shoulder and I could faintly hear him blurt to himself about how Chris disrespected him. He never spoke again after that as he left work. It's been one hour after this and Chris has seemed to have calmed down, and has started to joke to me about what happened. I think mum is just acting like nothing has happened as she's being normal.

For context,  let me start from the beginning,  but I'll try to keep it short since I can't recap my mom's 18 years of trauma :) . My mom had been married at the ripe age of 19 years and to a man 10 years older than her (also , my lovely father). No , it was not forced but arranged , and arranged marriages are a custom in our country , so nobody really objected.  My granny (AKA my father's mother) is the problem here , my father is a darling honestly.  Through my mother's  21 years of marriage 18 years had been spent with that beast. Let me tell you some stories ok . My mom used to live in Qubar with my father after marriage but because of some financial issues she had to move in with my granny in India , and my granny made her life a living hell. She would make my mother work while pregnant with me in ,  the kitchen while handling my other two sisters ( 3F and 8F ) at the time. She would torture my mother mentally with her demeaning words , spread lies about her around our relatives,  and even with maids . And because of all this , everybody started to look at her with hate . Apart from the mental and physical torture she would put poison in the mind of my father through calls , and since he was living in another country he would believe her . My mother also didn't have a phone , and all the money that my father sent from Qubar would be in the hand of my granny , so she would make my mother desperate for every rupee. She also wouldn't let my mother visit her mother , and not even let her talk to any loved ones , since my granny was the only one with the phone access.  In total , my mother would be isolated from her lived ones , hated by everyone around her and a total shell of a person . My father would talk to her time to time , but because of my granny they couldn't really bond. My mom also started developing psychological issues which she had to take psychiatrist medicines for . In total , she has diabetes , BP , psychiatrist,  spondylitis and asthma. And because of my mother's rapid decline in health my father finally noticed something was wrong . My father would visit every 3 months  (only for a week tho) ,  and he slowly took notice of my granny's toxic behavior towards my mother  , keep in mind she would only act half as bad infront of my father. Also , I was born during this time  . So my mom says that I was a like ticket to safety for her . After I was like 9-10 years old , I used to remember my granny and mother shouting , and my mother would be crying . In one of these fights , things got so serious that my granny kicked my mother out at 12 AM of NIGHT , I remember sitting in an auto going to my nanna's (mother's mother) house , while my mom was trying to hold it together. When my father heard about this he didn't belive my mom , and this was sweeped under the rug. My mom's breaking point was when my granny cursed my middle sister (13 F at the time) for hiding or rather taking batteries from her TV remote and putting them in our TV remote. And my granny's exact words were ""May god destroy her life , May she die "". Me and my middle sister were kinda mischievous in our childhood  , and my granny would not even give us 5 rupees to buy some snacks from the shop. That's why when our TV remotes battery was finished , my sister secretly took hers without asking . And the cherry on top was my father heard her cursing on the phone , he was supportive of my mother but this finally confirmed his suspicions. And my darling mother who frankly doesn't have a back bone finally stood up for herself after 18 years of torture , and that too for her kids . She demanded a separate home,  and my father happily gave her one . And this is the home we have been peacefully living in for the past 3 years . But recently their has been some health issues my granny . And the health issues aree  ""constipation"".  I mean who doesn't have constipation when they're 85 years old! . But no , she acts like she's dying , which I don't understand why she isn't. That is why recently she came in our home and lived with us since she isn't ""healthy "" and is feeling ""lonely"". She was supposed to live for one week , but she extended her stay for one more week . And now she is requesting to my father to let her stay beside our apartment . Keep in mind she is obsessed with TV and is also kinda deaf . And my father agreed! . My mom has been facing PTSD with her living in or home , but being the good wife she is she still takes care of her to a T. Even after all the treacherous things my granny has done!!. And the thought of my granny living with us permanently is having a lot of effect on my mother mentally . Even after telling my father this he insists on letting her live beside us , he isn't even listening.  After 3 months my father will retire permanently ( he now has a high paying job in Saudia Arabia) and will come back to live with us . He says he will take care of her ,  but those are just empty promises. So what should we do? What is the solution to this mess? How can my father fulfil his duty to his mother while being a good husband? How can my mother live peacefully with her around? My mother has given up , since we can't find a solution. Do you guy's have one?



TL:DR - my mentally and physically abusive granny abused my mother mentally for 18 years , causing her diabetes,  BP , asthma , spondylitis and physiatrist issues.  and cursed my middle sister that she should die and that her life should  be destroyed for taking her TV remote batteries , which caused my mother to take a stand and move out into another apartment , but now (after 3 years) my granny is demanding to move beside our apartment because she has constipation, feels like she is gonna die soon and feels lonely , my father is gonna retire permanently in 3 months , so we still have 3 months before she moves beside us . Can anyone give us a solution to this problem? How can we stop her from coming beside us permanently . Because my father bent up on his decision.",2,6,1744565520.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jyd32n/my_granny85f_that_has_been_mentally_abusing_my/
1jy9vs0,Cut ties with my family - but wanna make it up again,Mysterious_Charge654,"Hi! 

For context, I (22 F ) experienced very tough months lately. 

My family ( my dad, 2 brothers and my mom ) lives all together in Europe, and I live abroad since now 3 years in another European country. I work, I am successful and everything was going for the better. They told me a year ago that they were happy that I had a nice life abroad. 

But everything collapsed a few months ago, when I told them that I had someone in my life, and that we wanted to get married. 
My family is religious and very conservative. I grew up more open minded and less conservative, so I always kind of had to «  hide » some parts of my life ( like dating ) so after 2 years being with my boyfriend, we decided to tell my family about us. We couldn’t do it before because it’s not acceptable to date. So I wanted to tell them once we were ready for marriage. It went very bad. 

My boyfriend doesn’t share the same religion as my family, and that isn’t acceptable for them. My dad threatened to come where I live to «  eliminate him » if I wasn’t moving back to their house immediately. To what I answered by the negative. 

It would be way too long to write down the whole story, but I heard very hard things from my dad, like «  once you come back home I’ll make sure you have no more freedom, no more free will. » and so on. The argument put us in a hard situation with my boyfriend. We were hiding at other places in case my family would show up. 

I’ve cut the communication since 1,5 months now. I still receive texts from my mom, telling me how sad she is.

I dream of a life where my family understands that they cannot control me and that they have to accept me for who I am, so we can all be happy again. 


My dad is trying to call me every now and then, but I never pick up the phone. Mostly because I don’t even know what to say…

My mother has dementia that continues to get progressively worse. My father is the primary caregiver at home. Working on the next phase, which he has admitted is getting more brutal to bear. 

As an adult, I have not been close to my father or brother. But it is continuing to be forced as a form of family continuity.

1jxtgdb,My mom barely tolerates me,Automatic_Status_995,"My mother can barely stomach the fact that I feel even so much as tired under her care and in her household. 

I get that she's stressed out and tired at work, especially cause she's a single mom raising two kids and taking care of my grandmother at the same time. But honestly, it's being tiring. 

From a young age, she's always expected us to smile. If we keep so much as a sullen face, she'd ask why we're not smiling, as if she genuinely believes there's no reason why we wouldn't be happy. We'd get scolded, shout at in public in front of families and friends, if we even dare to cry. Confining us to that perfect family picture. 

So far, my sister has grown into exactly what she wants, the selfless and caring perfect happy child (spoilers: she not exactly). Me, on the other hand, have apparently grown into her worse nightmare. My mood swings a lot, to the point I'd think I'd go insane (if not already)

I can act happy, I've done that my whole life, but recently I'm too tired to actually care. And this has caused more and more fights between us (which I'm the past I was too scared of to not just do as she says).

Since a year or so ago, I've been really quiet and reserved whether or at home. She never had any problems with ignoring me at home but it was weirdly peaceful even though I acted that way outside, I figured maybe she didn't notice. I learned that, yes she did, when she herself mentioned it one time and I figured maybe she's trying, and I really appreciated that even if she never said anything bout it. 

Recently, however, she's been forcing me to join them in family activities even when I'm dead tired then lashing out at me when I ""give her attitude"" stating it tires her out to even look at me. 

I get that I'm just being selfish and ungrateful despite all she's done for me, for us, but I'm just so tired, not just physically but also mentally. Idk what to do honestly, I'm thinking either leaving or dying, the latter seems a little easier. ",1,0,1744497843.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jxtgdb/my_mom_barely_tolerates_me/

""See, I told you he doesn't give a shit about us!"" and proceeded to go outside for some air. Soon I go back inside and upstairs. My mom tries to defend him. I say no. Then my mom goes to talk to him and I hear him say: 
""She's a brat! If she thinks I don't care that I will show her what that looks like. Shes dead to me."" J get up and go to my room. Now I knew they didn't like me.

1jxocim,Never ending fight with my selfish sister,Puzzleheaded_Big7561,"TLDR: Sister is extremely selfish, expects everyone to drop everything for her and her family. Ongoing fights with no resolution. 

Ok this is going to be long one, so buckle up. 
If you manage to get through this whole post, thank you. 

I am 30F and my sister is 33F. 
I moved back home with my mum after I found out I was pregnant and couldn’t afford a rental, my partner and I tried for months but it’s just too competitive. 
We pay board and for groceries and all baby items. 

My mum owns a 3 bedroom house and when I moved back in she said I could use two of the bedrooms, one for me and my partner and the spare room for my daughters things, such as drawers to put clothes in and eventually use it as her bedroom once she is old enough/I feel comfortable with her being in a seperate room.

The bedrooms are very small so we don’t have too much space, the biggest room is my mums which is the master with a small walk in wardrobe and an ensuite (this is important later)

My sister is married and has 3 children, all 3 have adhd. This is also important later. 
Last year she cheated on her husband and ended up coming to stay with us for a little over a month with her 3 kids.
She ended up taking over the spare room so I had to move all of my daughters things to the garage, even though I was due to give birth in 6 weeks time.

During her stay, she didn’t contribute financially, she made a mess as did her children and she refused to clean up after herself or her children. I’m talking dirty nappies EVERYWHERE not even in a bag just on the floor, dirty tissues, fast food rubbish, dirty dishes, empty drink cans etc
My mum would come home from work and run around cleaning everything instead of telling her to pull her weight, mum would complain to me about her almost on a daily basis though. 

All of her children are medicated and during the stay she refused to give the medication because and I quote “I cbf” even when her eldest child was having mega melt downs and begging her for the medication. While she tells her kids to stfu if they are having a melt down or even if they’re happy and laughing “I don’t want to hear them at all”
On a few of the days she was here the kids were in their iPads for 12 hours straight! Which she usually just shoves their iPads in front of them, won’t encourage them to play outside, won’t do any activities with them etc.
So my mum and I ended up having to do a lot with the kids, which is fine but it got exhausting especially while my sister would just lounge about all day and sleep.

She eventually went home but says we needed to keep the spare room set up for her incase she wanted to come back. She’s back with her husband and they are in their own rental etc. 

This is where the issue started, because we can’t utilise the spare room we’ve had to use the living/dining area for drawers, change table and some of our daughters things and we spend a lot of time in the living room during the day. 

I had an extremely traumatic birth, had to have a c section which got infected and had placenta inside causing another infection 5 weeks after birth and had to get two additional surgeries, which I have another 6-8 week recovery. ATM I can’t even lift my daughter as I have a weight restriction. 
I’d also like to add that I’m a first time mum, after several losses so I’m extra protective of my child.

Now my sister is coming over whenever she wants because she wants to see the baby, not calling or texting first to see if we’re busy or up for a visit. I’ve said to her that because we’re so sleep deprived and I’m still recovering we need to get as much rest as possible so please call or text if she’s wanting to come see us. Mums given her a key so she’s been rocking up anytime she wants, waking us up and the baby and is super critical of everything we’re doing. 

“You’re burping her wrong”
“You’re swaddling her wrong” 
“You’re feeding her the wrong formula” 
“You’re not doing enough for her” 
Etc
“I have 3 kids so I know best” 

We spent some additional time in hospital as my daughter was sick at 2 weeks old and we found out she has cow milk protein allergy, so we have to feed her a special formula (I couldn’t breastfeed despite trying) 
This is something she attacks me about constantly saying the doctors are wrong and she just has colic. 

She comes to the house, makes me and my partner feel unwelcome in our own space, she treats mum like shit, brings over full baskets of washing because she “doesn’t know how to use a washing machine” 
She refuses to cook for herself or her kids “doesn’t know how to”
Refuses to work because she’s “incapable”
Tells mum she can’t spend time with her friends or boyfriend, borrows money she never pays back etc
Mum just lets this happen and has for years. 
I have another older sister and we have never and would never get away even asking mum to put on a load of washing for us, we’d probably get laughed at.

Tonight it got really bad. 
She has come over the last 3 days in a row with her children and husband, from like 9am until 9pm.
I have ASD and I get very overstimulated with lots of noise and loudness etc and she knows this. 
But she was screaming at her children for everything under the sun but mostly for laughing and playing (we were teaching them how to play a game on console) 

She wanted us to have all 3 children sleep over and my mum said no and has been saying no for the last few weeks because she’s not 100% well and it’s too chaotic when they aren’t medicated.
They also insist on sleeping in the living room, not the room that was set up specifically for them, it turns into a huge fight and melt down every time we have tried to get them to sleep in there.
I also explained to my sister that I am up ever. 3-4 hours feeding, changing nappies etc and I have to use the living room to do so, so her kids sleeping in there would be too difficult as they would be woken up etc and it’s just not reasonable. 

She complains that she needs a break from her kids when they are in school and daycare 5 days a week, the school kids go to before and after school care and she doesn’t pick them up from school or daycare until 6pm. She isn’t working, literally lays in bed all day and doesn’t do anything around the house. Her husband complains to me about it all the time. 

Then she wanted to feed my daughter and I hesitantly agreed because I honestly needed a little break. But while she was feeding her she was refusing to burp her until she finished her whole bottle (100ml) and I was telling her no you have to burp her several times otherwise she’ll vomit. 
She ignored me and said she knows best cos she has 3 kids. 

Her husband decided that he was going to rearrange the house and garden. My partner asked if he needed help on several occasions and he either ignored him on a few times or said no. Usually my partner does the gardening and mowing every 2-3 weeks but hasn’t had the chance due to my surgeries and having to look after our daughter full time.

So we all stayed inside and watched tv. 
During that time I was using my mums iPad and a text comes through from my sister bitching about me and my partner saying that we weren’t helping her husband and I was like wtf? Why not just talk to me if there’s an issue
Mum wasn’t home so she didn’t reply. 

I tried to speak to her about it and she just blew up and I said I didn’t want her to be disrespectful to us in our space and she went on a huge rant saying how we disrespect her and my mum and mum wants her house back etc
Then went on to say I’m going to end up a single parent and she doesn’t think my partner is the one for me etc and was basically attacking every angle she could. 

I did snap back and say a few of the things I listed above. 

Then she said I am a lazy parent and my daughter deserves better! 
She said she sees my partner doing everything for our child, which he does do a lot and I had to remind her that I’ve just had two additional surgeries, I’m healing and have a weight restriction and I physically can’t lift my daughter, 
My partner picks her up and brings her to me for feeds and takes her to the change table and I’ll do the nappy, takes her to the bath so I can bath her etc - I will say I’m super grateful for my partner being so supportive and helpful. 
She also said this is not our house and we are just guests, so only mum can tell her to call or message before she comes etc

I’ve set other boundaries in place regarding my daughter such as not kissing her, I’m not a kissy person and it’s a risk with young children from what I’ve been told. And my sister will refer to my daughter as “her baby” and kiss her 20 times in the space of 5 minutes. I have addressed it so many times with her among other things and I said if she can’t stick to my boundaries and rules with my daughter then she needs to back off.

She eventually left and it was just a shit show. 
My mum came home after a while and I explained to her everything that had happened. Mum isn’t one who wants to get involved which I totally understand. 
I hate fighting and conflict myself so I always try to communicate and diffuse any crappy situation but my sister made it impossible this time because she continued to message me when she was at home and just was awful to me.

I’m not sure what to do because I don’t think she’s capable of changing. She has always been extremely self absorbed and any time she is told no by any of us she says she’s depressed and if we don’t do what she wants she’ll kill herself -_-
Mum doesn’t see this as an issue and takes her seriously every time she says it, but she says it to everything. Even if mum says she can’t talk long because she has a meeting or she can’t see her today because if xyz that’s her go to.

I don’t want to feel uncomfortable in my own living space and I am desperately looking to find another living arrangement with my partner and daughter. To the point that we have services helping us look into crisis housing because of other things going on in the home/family. 

I’m not really sure what I’m hoping for posting this but I really needed to get it off my chest. 
Thank you if you got this far and sorry it’s so long.

1jxo58h,"Love my family, but….",Reasonable-Alps4821,"Hello! So I don’t know anyone else in my personal life who is like this so I thought I’d share.

I really do love my family but I do not care to see them. Growing up I was the odd one, like all my siblings and cousins and the neighbor kids would hang out but for some reason I didn’t, even though I was always nice, I guess I was just weird??? I was the only one getting teased and told to go away. I wasn’t even that much younger, my cousin and some of the neighbor kids were my age or younger. 

Well fast forwarding to adulthood, nothing really changed. Our family split up and we started doing our own things but the last couple years everyone has been rekindling since my mom died (which my sisters didn’t tell me even though I lived with her the longest)… Btw I’m 27f, happily married with no kids. I only care to be with my husband, especially on holidays and such but he’s very social and loves going to see them and I’m like, ehh.. I wish I fit in.

I do have some trauma coming from that side that no one ever acknowledged, which I would rather them not but they sure do love talking about their own. 
Like this- my mom was an addict and always in and out in our lives, and I was stuck with her the longest, when she was getting high with creepy men and having me move constantly to homeless shelters, randos houses and random motels or even a car, I had an abusive adult bf when I was a teen that my mom had me live with, like there are so many things they don’t know.. my siblings and cousins didn’t have it easy but they got out before she got too bad to the point she died. Like I always hear about my sister’s trauma for instance, everyone knows about it and feels bad about it.. maybe it’s just one of those things that I never opened up to them so how would they know but I know they don’t care enough to hear about what I went through. 

It’s hard being around them because they bonded and I just never got the chance. My brother did live on the street as a teen and lived with friends and whatnot too and had drug problems too, he and I get along well and listen to each other but it’s seldom when we get that time, but he does see my other sister a lot. I’ve come to realize that I do want to move away with my husband, far from them. My husband agrees he wants to move but at the same time I know he is a family man, he loves being with his whole family and mine so I feel bad talking about moving so much. Like I said, he wants to move as well but I don’t want to be pushy. 

Thought I’d rant a little, maybe someone is in a similar situation?? I spared a lot of details but I think the point is made.",1,0,1744483069.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jxo58h/love_my_family_but/
1jxn6pw,my dad,ShowerDapper3443,"I'm a teenage girl and I suppose I'm just coming on here for advice since I don't know who to come to about this. 

I suppose from the outside my family looks normal. I live with my little sister and my parents. They both make decent money. I have a good relationship with my mum, but for the past few years, my relationship with my dad has become weird. 

I'm not sure why this is. Maybe because I'm growing up. The only thing we really have in common is the music we listen to. Lol. 

My dad isn't really a typical dad. You see, he's got a normal job on the outside that he gets stressed about but then he's a DJ on the side. He's always been in bands and stuff like that but he's never really been too successful. 

My dad has always had anger issues. I'm not sure why. His parents are divorced but this happened later in his life, and he openly admitted he was happy about it. He grew up in poverty. His dad wasn't too nice by the sounds of it but whenever it's brought up my dad sort of makes it into a joke. 

These anger issues very rarely came into the family when I was younger. But more recently (in the past few years) they have. 
He gets so angry over stupid stuff. He swears a lot to himself (almost like Tourette's or something) sometimes when he's just by himself not even doing anything he'll shout stuff like ""fucking bastard"" out of nowhere. 

He sometimes has these outbursts where he'll punch things and just drive off or walk off. There's been several occasions where him and my mum have argued over stupid stuff, my mum handles it like an adult but he walks away ahead in front of us like an angry kid would. Its embarrassing for me.

There was one major incident a few months ago. I can't remember how it happened but it was to do with the TV. I think I asked to watch something different, and he took it as ""she didn't want to watch TV with me, she wanted me to leave"", from what he told my mum. That night he drove off, punched a hole in the door, once he left my mum was kicking the door, my mum yelled at me and told me it was my fault. Me and my sister were crying.The next day I was made to apologise to him. We pretended the whole thing didn't happen.

I know that sometimes I can be rude to my dad but there is this sort of double standard that he can make a joke about me or be sarcastic, but when I do it he can shout at me and make a huge deal. 

It sounds bad but sometimes it feels better when my dads not home.

1jxir6a,I have my mother and brother and his girlfriend living in our home. My brother always back pay and my mom when I ask for her portion she easily gets offended.,Either-Increase-474,"I am a married woman with three littles and 7 months pregnant. My brother was living us and unexpectedly had his girlfriend come what was an everyday stay to a permanent stay without asking me. He pays $400 a month but always back paying from what he owed. I increased his rent to $450 starting June.

My mom moved in with us last August. She pays $600 and I said with $50 at least for food contribution because I cook and she eats from us (not my brother and his girl, they support their own food). I don't mind, but between the utilities, the space, using soap, laundry detergent & all that stuff, and the food I believe $650 is reasonable from my mom. However, she just gives me $600 these past months and I don't complain about it because that's my mom.

In January, she thought she paid me $600 but turned out to be $400 and so she is back pay and she said she will give me from her taxes. So when I question to her about it she gets offended and said she communicated that with me. She only told me that she owes taxes so she won't get nothing back.... So I told her ""you told me about you not getting taxes back but not how you're planning to pay going forward"".... Her reply is ""I guess I pay you slowly...."" And then starts making comments ""I just starting my morning.. I work my schedule around you. You don't do nothing for me.. I'm your mother, not a stranger""... And I'm there sitting there and reminding her that I'm not here to argue I'm just asking because I need to know a plan. 

Mind you, she comes home every night from working as a medical assistant at 6:30pm. She does not help me with the kids, which is fine but by then they're ready for bed and my husband and I taken care of everything, even the cooking. She picks up the kitchen after us which is nice, here and there. So when she said she works around my schedule... How? Just the one time your half day off I ask to watchy youngest for two hours so I can register my oldest for school and take for blood work.

 Even on the weekends it is a rare moon if she cooks, but hardly ever... She stays in her room. I get it. It's hers day off. I  She doesn't drive so she is dependent on us grocery shopping or relying on someone to drive her... 

It's crazy because my grandmother (my mom's mom) took care all four of us siblings.... Cooked and took us to our appointments while my mom was either working or out with some guy or clubbing... Like what my grandmother has done for us is no way in comparison how my mom is with my children and I don't get expect much either but sheesh. ..

She normally pays me half $300 early month and the other half $300. I just received $250.... And I will have to ask what happened to the remaining because she does not communicate with me about it until I ask.. ""I'll pay you the rest on my next paycheck"".

I'm the oldest of the four siblings who have a career, a home, and a family.... And it just seems like I do so much and the comments is so... Unnecessary. I am just here to vent.

1jxefa2,"My parents keep forcing, blaming, swearing and ""disciplining"" me for the wrong reasons",my-parents-suck-887,"Hi all! As the title says, my parents keep forcing me to do things, blaming me for the things I accidentally did because something was in the way, or it was just a mistake. The other ""swearing and disciplining me for the wrong reasons"" happens that when I make a singular mistake, and cause a small accident that doesn't even hurt anybody. 

Is there even a way to change their minds? Because when I disobey because I just don't want to do it, or can't do it, they punish me. And when I talk back to defend myself, they steal the things I like away from me, and saying I don't care for them (like please... I do most of the chores as of now, even without rest and even if I'm mad at you two... and I even try to stop you guys from fighting each other.), an example is that they force me to sleep for ZERO reason (excuse: ""you're gonna be crying because you're gonna be lacking sleep as an adult"", like mostly, some adults have a bad sleeping schedule) and not let me have my own decisions, even when I'm energetic. Then they're complaining why I don't talk to them much, addicted to the computer (I am since it's the sacred thing to me, where communities ONLY love me for making things), lazy and other stupid things... Like seriously, do you see what you're doing? ...And what I am doing?

Rest aside, I just need some enlightenment and knowledge for ignoring them respectfully anymore. I don't like how they treat me, nor will I do the same thing to them just for my future family and other generations to come atleast be at peace unlike what it is as of now.",1,0,1744454379.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jxefa2/my_parents_keep_forcing_blaming_swearing_and/
1jxds4c,AITA if i sue my adopted parents? TW?,AdvertisingMotor1429,"for some background here i (18F) was adopted when i was 12 by my paternal grandfather and step grandmother. they raised me and my little brother (16M) since i was 7 and he was 5 when we had got taken from our bio dad but that’s a story for another time. things were never great but my little brother and i had definitely seen a lot worse. fast forward to around the time the adoption was finalized and i was going thru a really hard time mentally. ik ur probably thinking i was being bullied or something but school was actually the only thing i looked forward too. it was the one place i knew i was liked bc i was farely popular until high school when i became antisocial from being basically kidnapped. i was obsessed with losing weight so i wouldn’t eat but my adopted mom still always called me f@t and told me i needed to cut back (for context ive never been f@t. at the age of 18, im 4’11 with a petite frame and have never been over 130 lbs) they liked to call me a wh0re and tell me i was gonna be “fast in the @$$” bc my mom had me at 16. they cut my hair so that i “wouldn’t be attractive” (to not be “fast” like my mom) and was always told growing up that nobody would ever love me (this still causes issues in my relationships and friendships). i wasn’t allowed to have any friends and when i did make any friends my adopted mom would find some reason for me to not hang out with them anymore (she legit told me i couldn’t be friends with one girl bc her mom was a single mom) they would hit us a lot but we kind of just put up with it. fast forward to aug 2019. i was in 7th grade and i told my adopted mom i had been feeling very sad lately and didn’t know why (i didn’t know i was depressed or what depression even was bc mental health was never brought up, hell the only time they even did anything abt our physical health was the dentist, when we needed shots for school or when it was something really serious) or what to do to be happy again and she told me i had nothing to be sad about and was “exaggerating for attention” so i let it drop and that honestly didn’t help. idk if it made it worse but ik it didn’t help. nov 2019 , i tried taking my life for the first time in my closet with a blade from a box cutter razor i found downstairs months prior and had been using to SH. my little brother unfortunately (i say unfortunately bc he had to see that and this will forever be etched into his mind not bc i survived , im forever grateful my brother stopped me that day) walked into the closet and seen me and he ofc went and told. i had a quite bit of blood loss but my adopted parents didnt seem bothered enough to even pretend to care. my adopted dad shrugged it off as he went outside to smoke a cigarette and my adopted mom ran water over my cut and wrapped it up. she made me clean my blood up (which im not mad about bc i wouldnt wanna clean sb else blood either) idk if they did this just to spite me or what but immediately after i was done cleaning i was told to get in the car we were going to get food so we go get food and she makes us also go to hella different stores and i ended up passing out in majority of those stores from the blood loss. i was punished for “staying up all night” (why else was i “falling asleep” while standing, right?) after abt a week considering my cut was pretty deep and done with an old dusty box cutter razor that hadn’t been cleaned (don’t judge me i wanted to d!e the last thing i was worried abt was dried up bl00d) it ended up getting infected. (i ended up having to take antibiotics when it was finally looked at and got told i should’ve came in for stitches) since it was winter time tho i was able to cover it up with hoodies and long sleeved shirts. except for in gym class. in my district they make us dress out for gym in middle school to prepare us for highschool. so ig sb seen and reported it to the school guidance counselor cus i got an ass whooping from hell when she got home from work that night for “letting family business be known to the public” (we were always told that what happens behind closed doors stays behind closed doors) well dec of 2019 i met a senior at the highschool and being in seventh grade i didn’t realize how weird it was that a 12th grader wanted to date a 7th grader but i just felt like i was special bc nb else had an older boyfriend just me. so anyways he asked me to sneak out with him. i had never done that before but being young and immature , after awhile of hearing “if you loved me you would do it” (yes being older i now see all the signs and take full responsibility for what happened) but i snuck out with him and we went to the park (innocent enough) but he ended up r@ping me on the park bench and when i told my adopted parents the next morning i was called a wh0re and much more. i didn’t go to school that day bc my adopted dad was taking me to the doctor. they never once asked if i was okay or if i was hurt. just immediately told me i was lying abt being r@ped bc i had gotten pregnant. we go to the dr , dr confirms im not pregnant and that i have trauma consistent with assault. to this day they still haven’t asked me who or how or anything. they still think im lying. before we left the dr i was asked to fill out a mental health questionnaire and the results to that questionnaire deemed me high risk so i got taken to the mental hospital and from dec 2019 to march 2023 i was consecutively in different mental hospitals, residentals, and group homes (and with my occasional law breaking, about 6 months out of that time was in a juvenile detention center) in march 2023 i ran away from the group home i had ben staying at for almost a year at that point when i moved in with my brother and was kept there the whole time against my will but technically i was “on the run”til jan 2024. when i got out that house in jan 2024 i was sent to live with my adopted parents once again (one thing i didnt add is that i was a living walking breathing nightmare while i was in those treatment facilities. anybody who has been in any of the four will tell you it will change who u are. ur not looked at as human by the staff they looked at us like paychecks. i have so many stories of staff doing more to traumatize us kids than they did to help us but bc my behaviors were so bad they couldn’t find anywhere else to take me that’s why i had to go back btw) but i thought ill be 18 in a year and ik i dont wanna be here a minute longer than i must so i got a job and started saving. i bought my first phone that i paid for and kept turned on with my own money. everything i owned (shoes clothes makeup perfume hygiene products) was bought with MY money that I worked really really hard for. work was the only time i was able to get away from them until i went back to school to get my GED which was only a week before the incident. so anyways, work was my safe place. i used to come in early and stay late. i would call on my days off and ask if i could come in (i worked at a burger king so we always had call outs) and my managers knew everything that was going on in that house bc i live in a very small town and word gets around and they were never shy to yell or argue in public and if my hours got to high they would just let me sit in the back office so i wouldnt have to be home. after about a month of living there, her and my little brother got into a really big argument bc he was eating at the table where he normally eats and she for some reason wanted him to eat downstairs (i was not home for this i was at work this is just what was told to me by my brother) he refused saying he wasn’t in the mood to be around people and just wanted to be alone but she wasn’t having it. she then goes to the kitchen and starts closed fists punching my then 15 year old brother in the face and he never once hit her back but she busted his lip pretty bad to the point that he stayed up for me to come home so he could cry in my bed and talk to me abt it. i took pictures and sent them to cps but when they asked him he said he got scared and lied and said he fell. after that i couldn’t look at her the same so a lot of arguments occurred. one night abt a week after that fight with my brother she randomly comes into my room at 2am to ask me if ive stole her phone. i asked her why would i buy and pay for my own phone if i was gonna just steal hers? i was then told to give her my phone for talking back and said that i was grounded but i refused bc i paid for my phone and told her i will gladly give u my phone if u give me the money i paid for it but that just made her madder so she went and got my adopted dad (yes at 2am) and they came into my room and yelled at me for like 10 minutes for me to give them my phone and i kept repeating the same thing to them everytime until my adopted dad told me if i didn’t give it to him he would beat it out of me so i told him go ahead and do it. so he hit me and i wasn’t hitting back at first because he is still my biological grandpa at the end of the day. but then my adopted mom jumped in so i did start hitting back. once i hit back they called the police. long story short i got locked up even tho it was self defense , it was two people’s word against mine. i got locked up and was locked up from the end of feb 2024 til may 2024. while i was in detention i obtained my GED and got accepted into esthetician school at an academy abt an hour away. the whole time i was locked up , i called every chance i could and never got any answer. i was found guilty but bc i had behave the whole time i was in the dhome, got my GED, and got accepted into school i was allowed to leave the dhome on probation. because returning back home was obviously not an option this time i was sent to an independent living program which would end up being another traumatic experience that i actually just got out of two weeks ago which brings us to why im thinking abt suing. so my DSS worker picks me up from the dhome with all my stuff that was supposed to have been packed. i got in the car and saw one bag. ik i didn’t own a lot since everything i owned i bought with my minimum wage job and still had a phone bill, my part of rent, and food to buy with those checks but i worked a lot and had made a lot of money so i knew i would have at least 3 bags but when i asked my DSS worker she said that’s all she was handed so i was like idk maybe they packed tf out that bag. but i get to my brand new apartment and open the bag and find a single a sock, a pair of underwear, 3 pairs of sweatpants, 2 blankets, and a fitted sheet. no shoes, no shirts, none of my hygiene stuff none of my other bedding, NOTHING. so ofc i contact my DSS worker and inform her and i also let her know that my adopted mom should have about $400 that belong to me from my last check at burger king before i got locked up (the only way i was allowed to get the job was if i got the money sent to her bank account) so my DSS worker tells me she’ll talk to them. they claimed that’s all that was in my room and that they had already given me my last check. i wasn’t too worried abt the check idk y but i wasnt. it got sent out while i was locked up so it like in my head it didn’t really exist. idk if that makes sense but anyways turns out they let my cousin go in my room while i was locked up and lied to her and told her i said she could go in there and take wtvr she wanted bc my new house wasn’t big enough for everything (i was still in the dhome and independent living wasnt on the table at that point) so she goes in my room and takes practically everything (everything in the bag was all she left…yeah, she even took my underwear) and i honestly don’t know what happened to the phone. i was upset at first but i eventually got over it but im still very upset abt the fact they gave away everything i paid for with my money and everytime i bring it up to them i get called “ungrateful” bc they gave away a lot of freedom and time and money to take care of me and my little brother and they’ve spent more money on me then i did on anything in that room. so aita if i sue them to replace everything they gave away?

1jx82ez,Am I the problem?,Lost_Evidence4385,So long story short my dad terminated his rights to me when I was 12. I had requested it because of his wife he had. Was constantly abusive and it was to the point where she would practically torture me. Yes I mean torture to give an example her idea of punishment was to stand on a footstool with a broom above my head and stand for hours and if I dropped I'd get hit with the broom handle or what finnally put the nail on the head was when knowing I was terrified of the dark she saw I had cracked my door open and saw my hand in the door and slammed my hand into the door woke up with blood all over my pillow. Anyways my dad wasn't great ethier he knew about it all. He also wasn't really a dad wasn't around and when he was it was usually pretty terrible to now I'm an adult he's divorced her and now I've got my own kids today after I didn't visit when I was around his town he had recently gotten cought up in a fire and had some smoke inhale from that but he told me he was fine I took my kids to the circus with another family member and when I didn't stop he was pissed to say the least. Screamed at me it was all my fault my mom and her guy and myself made him sign. I force him to be the villain. I need to grow balls and tell the person I was with they needed to stop so I could see them I can't drive RN he knows this the person I was with hates him. He's mad because I don't allow him to lie to the woman he is engaged to. I mean huge lies like him being in the military! He wasn't!

I go down to see him and have been there a few times he's been here maybe 3 and it was for his benefit all but once. We live an hour apart. He screamed at me in public on the phone!

1jx6ttv,I just realized my brothers raised me. What do I do?,sunnydays191715,"So yesterday, I (16f) had an epiphany. I want advice on how to minimize the burden on my brothers (18m and 20m), deal with my mother, and refer to this in the future. 

I already knew I had a traumatizing childhood (0-8), because it’s common knowledge in my family that my middle brother, who I’ll call A, and my dad had anger issues. They both have gotten therapy and the last incident with A was when I was 7. The last incident with my dad was when I was 12, but the one before that was when I was 8. Incident meaning yelling, throwing things, etc. No one has ever hit me, but I’ve heard the anger issues hit my eldest brother, who I’ll call S, worse.

My mom has issues, because she had a really bad childhood. I won’t elaborate, but she is much better. I really think she broke the cycle, even if she started a new one. She knows this, but what she denies vehemently is that she has major control issues. I’ve brought it up to her, but she gets mad and insists that my dad is manipulating me.

My parents mostly separated in 2016 and signed the divorce papers in 2024. They regularly badmouth each other, although my dad can admit my mom’s strengths and my mom cannot do the reverse.

I realized something more was wrong when I looked at my writing and realized that all of my main characters have bad parental relationships and extremely strong sibling relationships. I also realized my anxiety treats my parents like a threat and my siblings like safety. Also, A recently went no-contact with my mom. I have a severe phobia of anger and so have a hard time dealing with difficult conversations.

The two complicated issues are therapy and my siblings. The therapy issue is that my first therapist was telling my mom what I had said about her. Obviously, this was unethical and probably illegal, but I’m not interested in going down that route. The main issue now is that I’m afraid to get another therapist because of that broken trust. Hence asking Reddit for advice.

The sibling thing is that S effectively raised A and me. A and I have talked about it and we’re both very grateful. S has asked me not to bring it up again. This makes sense, but considering that my brothers are my rock, I want advice on how to minimize my burden on him. A and I have also always been close and he raised me after S moved out three-four years ago. Context: All five of us live in different states and I call my siblings 1-3 times a week each. I want to stay close to them, but S is having a rough time and I don’t want to put more pressure on him. When I say “raise,” I mean helping me through panic attacks, reading me bedtime stories, driving me to school and activities, cooking me dinner, helping me with schoolwork, and teaching me (neurodivergent) how to socialize. There’s more they’ve done for me, but suffice to say S was definitely parentified.

Is this neglect? Manipulation? Emotional abuse? Toxicity? What would you call this? How can I support S? How should I deal with my mom?",2,0,1744423978.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jx6ttv/i_just_realized_my_brothers_raised_me_what_do_i_do/

I know he loves me and I know he just wants me to do my best but I’m trying. I am taking 5 college courses, transferring to a 4 year college this Fall, working a part time job where I’m the only one who actually does my work, and trying to drive. I’ve been deathly afraid of driving since I could remember, I’m 20 so I’m pretty late to driving but I’m trying to get over the fear and I’m trying. I’m also going to therapy to work on my anxiety issues. In high school my GPA was a 2.5, now it is a 3.2. Overall I’m really stressed because of everything I am doing. I got in the car yesterday and talked to dad about my day. I said I tried to apply for different jobs this summer because I don’t like my current one. The job I want to apply for requires a lot of driving and I know I don’t have my license but by this summer I am hoping to get it. He said “This is why you should have been driving at 16, you can’t get that job if you can’t drive.” I know that and I already feel bad about that. Long story short we got into a big argument in the car about driving. He said I was acting like my mom (I don’t like my mom for multiple reasons), he told me he’d try not to call me that anymore yet he keeps doing it. I broke down in the passenger seat. When we got home he talked more about it and I said “I don’t want you saying I’m like mom anymore” and he literally unpaused his show and kept watching TV while I talked. I cried again and started to SH, I haven’t done that in at least a year because I told my sister I wouldn’t but I snapped. It just feels like no matter how hard I try I’m never trying hard enough. I love my dad and he’s a good dad but sometimes he pushes me too hard. I’m already doing so much and he keeps pushing me. He never notices my work and I wish he did. I want to make him proud. My girlfriend ended up picking me up and I stayed at her place for the night. Sometimes my dad is too logical, I don’t get emotional support from my mom, my sister doesn’t like talking about emotions, and my dad doesn’t comfort me, he always says I could do this or that. I just feel like a failure, I’m proud of myself but he’s not and I want his validation. I’m just in a really bad place right now and need some support.

1jwunje,My Twisted Sister,lost-in-my-mind34,"I, 36F, have always had a rocky relationship with my sister, 27F. (We will call her M) From the day she was born, chaos has always ensued. She didn't have colic, or anything like that, but cried all the time., day to night. Night to day. My mother, who has not always been the most stable (this is important for later)has NEVER been able to console her. She would try everything, but still. And it seems like they just never connected. She loves my sister without a doubt, but the bond was never there. It was left on me because it was even difficult for my stepfather to deal with. (Hes just an Ahole, again will be prevalent later but they didnt last longer than 10 years) ALL through my sister's life, she was definitely different, and manipulative. If I didn't do something she wanted, she would threaten to tell my mom or something (I would get into trouble because rather than deal with the issue, my mother would say just give it to her so she'll shut up) She also slept in our mother's bed till she was 14, regardless of her having a boyfriend who also lived with us. He would be sent to the couch or spare room because if she didn't get her way, yup, threats would ensue. And they were WILD. In any case this would happen when she didn't get her way. I paid no mind to it, because by this time I was older and just graduated, moved in with my boyfriend, and was pregnant with my first child. I would still take her sometimes as a big sister would. One instance I can remember was I brought her to the fair with MY DAD. we were sitting at the pizza joint, and M was pulling antics to get anything other than pizza (I wasn't paying so I told her no) she started to get flippy and my father said ""she may be your sister. But she's MY daughter, you cannot speak to her that way!"" For the first time. I saw shock and heard silence from this child. Fast forward a few years later. My mother had given in to every whim, been to every event. And was not the perfect mother, but an appeasing one. My grandmother was sick, dying of cancer. My mother gave custody to my sister's dad,  because he would not let her leave the state with my sister, even to take care of her dying mother. She was gone for 6 months before my grandmother passed. And only staying behind for a few months after to take care of the estate. When she returned for the funeral, my sister was the most horrible person to her. Saying she abandoned her, she was glad my grandmother had died. Even throwing a fit at the funeral to leave because she was bored. Yes a 16 year old who knew better. I was appalled and felt horrible for my mother. They're relationship became tumultuous at best after that, and I stayed cordial, because I truly just did not like her as a person. I loved her. But it's not something I lost sleep over when she didn't call me back or didn't see her for 2 months, etc. I still tried to have a relationship. She was nice enough to let my 15 y/o daughter, L, stay with her for a month while she finished up freshman year when we had to move out of state. Awesome. I sent my daughter $50 p/wk and supplied all her food through a delivery app for her and extras for my sisters household. So she wasn't an inconvenience to M. And my daughter L would stay with my other sister (B) for the last month (they live in the same community) some of her things had been left behind at M's house and I got a very irate phone call threatening to have everything thrown out because she no longer wanted them there. Knowing full well I was unable to come and get them as i wasnin another state.. Our mother who overheard this called my sister and they had a screaming match saying not so kind things to each other and ultimately blocking each other. So, I had my mom message M's fiance to make him aware of the situation and ensure my daughters things would be safe. I called my dad to have the items picked up and he was there within 2 days to get it. I continued to carry on my relationship with my sister, with her belittling my mom as ""toxic"" because she got her fiance involved. (She doesnt want him to know the real her!) I supported her decision to not speak to our mother, but always insisted she forgave her as it was also a reaction to M's toxicity as well. Our mother had apologized and didn't feel it was fair for her cut her off over M's outburst. I felt sorry for our mother. As M got married and is expecting her own child very soon. She wanted to be involved and M just wasn't having it. But still remains talking to others instead. By pure Manipulation at best and posting on social media negatively about our mother. I called her out on it. I've apologized and forgiven where I can in life. But I pointed out her toxicity as well. Even towards her own niece. Now I'm cut off too and waved me never meeting her child in my face. Fine. But then she also took to messenger to tell my kids how much she loves them even if we are not speaking. THAT is when I finally lost it! Her manipulation of this entire family was done! I will NOT have her do that with them as well. I called her every name in the book and told her to F-OFF! and blocked her on everything. So we come down to today. She's in labor. Our mother and I found out through another family member (which I think is insane that they know to begin with. Because as thos other person is also a mother, they still HAVE to be on M's side with all of this when I feel as a family we should band together to make my sister see the error of her terroristic lifestyle, but I guess that's just me) she will never know how much this is hurting the family. But she doesn't care. I need advice in what to do. I'm so lost 😞 I don't like having this much animosity towards someone who deserves it, and she is also breaking our mothers heart. What should I do?? I hate that I care!!! 😒 ",2,0,1744390401.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwunje/my_twisted_sister/
1jwtcnr,"My mom wants to kick out my 17-year-old brother, and now she’s asking me to take him in. I asked for $1,500/month, and she says I’m selfish. Am I wrong for setting that boundary?",Creative-Raisin-6010,"

I’m (19F) a full-time college student living with my long-term boyfriend (20M). We have a one-bedroom apartment, and I’m on track to get my PhD. I’ve worked really hard to get where I am, especially after growing up in a really dysfunctional household.

My dad died when I was 8. My mom eventually remarried a man I’ve never gotten along with. My childhood was chaotic—screaming over little things, emotional manipulation, and guilt-tripping. I was hospitalized a few times for mental health struggles before I was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16. Medication, a school change, and therapy saved me. I’ve kept myself afloat with scholarships, a part-time job, and federal financial aid.

My younger brother (17M) is now in crisis. He also has bipolar disorder and ADHD. Over the past two years, things have gotten worse: substance abuse, bizarre behavior, copying other people’s personalities, robbing a house, having alcohol poisoning (twice), and generally acting out. He just started therapy and medication a month ago, and while there’s been some improvement, he recently relapsed—he found a bottle of 30-year-old brandy and drank it in secret, ending up hospitalized again.

This morning, my mom called me sobbing saying she “can’t do it anymore.” She told me she’s done, that her relationship with my stepdad is falling apart because of my brother, and that he needs to move out. He’s still five months away from turning 18, and technically still in high school, though he’s trying to fast-track his graduation to attend college in my city.

She asked if he could move in with me until then.

Here’s the issue: I live in a one-bedroom apartment with my boyfriend. Rent and bills total about $1,200/month. I already work part time, attend school full time, and have $15k in federal student loan debt. My boyfriend is extremely understanding and supportive, and said he’s okay with my brother staying if my mom covers our full rent. I agree with that, and told her I’d need $1,500/month to take this on—this isn’t just about space. It’s about the emotional, psychological, and financial responsibility of being a full-time caretaker, therapist, and life manager for a very unstable teenager.

My mom was furious. She told me I’m being selfish and that she “can’t afford that,” even though she and my stepdad make over six figures in a town with a low cost of living. For context, when my dad died, I was left a few thousand dollars. My mom didn’t save anything for college and refuses to help now because “her parents didn’t help her.” The only reason I’ve been getting financial aid is because she’s a tax accountant and manipulated their income for the past few years. But this year, she told me they’re reporting over $200k—so I’m likely going to lose most of that aid. Her response was just, “You’ll get scholarships with your grades.” I’ve gotten three this year—but they only total $3,000.

So now I’m stuck. I love my brother. I practically raised him through a lot of chaos. I don’t want him on the street. But I can’t afford to go backwards emotionally, academically, or financially—and this would take so much out of me. He’d be living on our couch, around all the time, and I’d be walking on eggshells trying to keep things stable.

I feel horrible for even considering saying no. But if I say yes and she refuses to help financially, I genuinely don’t know how I’ll survive school or stay afloat.

Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Am I wrong for asking to be compensated for taking on something this big? How do you protect yourself when your family dumps their responsibility on you but calls you selfish for needing support?

TL;DR: I (19F) escaped a toxic home and now my mom wants to kick out my 17-year-old brother and send him to live with me. I asked for $1,500/month to help cover rent and the emotional toll. She got mad and called me selfish. I feel guilty—but I also don’t want to fall apart trying to save everyone else.

1jwsjxp,Has anyone else cut off family due to political/religious toxicity? Did “found family” actually work for you?,Few-Temporary-5892,"Hi all,
I’m slowly coming to terms with the fact that I may never agree with my family—and they may never agree with me. I was raised in a conservative Christian household where image was everything. My parents had a toxic marriage but made sure to smile every Sunday in church. Mental health wasn’t taken seriously; I grew up with undiagnosed ADHD that was brushed off as laziness or rebellion.

Things only got worse from there. My mom, who has struggled with alcoholism my whole life, eventually stole my identity. I had to press charges and cut contact. My dad is now engaged to a deeply judgmental woman who’s made it clear she doesn’t like me, mostly because I don’t live my life exactly the way she does.

I moved away almost two years ago with my fiancé—who is wonderful and supportive—and that distance has done wonders for my mental health. Over time, I’ve become a progressive atheist, and I feel like my family’s tolerance for me has completely eroded. I’ve always tried to respect their views, even when I disagreed. But the same grace has never been extended to me. Every time I express a thought publicly that doesn’t align with their views, I get pushback, criticism, or dogpiled. It’s exhausting.

Sometimes I think it would be easier to just fall in line—to believe what they believe and avoid all the tension. But I can’t. I don’t want to live in an echo chamber of far-right extremism, even if it would make my life simpler.

Lately, I’ve been considering cutting ties with most of them—not out of anger, but out of self-preservation. I’m tired of being the scapegoat. I’m tired of walking on eggshells. I’m tired of feeling like who I am is a problem to be fixed.

So I guess I’m wondering:
Has anyone here gone low/no contact with family for similar reasons? Did found or chosen family actually help fill that void? Did it bring any peace?

I’d really appreciate hearing from folks who’ve been through this. Thanks for reading.",1,0,1744385111.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwsjxp/has_anyone_else_cut_off_family_due_to/
1jwscf8,"What to do with impulsive, overly dramatic stupid parents?",Early_Day_6014,"I will get straight to the point. The situation as they grow older becomes worse. They are nearly 60 years old and you need to be cautious around them, because they create problems out of nowhere that could easily get you in danger. Recent example of what Im saying:

We were about to go for a stroll with my mother, it was 8 in the noon. Father decided to come as well, and he suggested to call for an Uber since he can't drive with an injured arm, and go somewhere else all together. We agreed. Fast forward, we were waiting for the taxi to come but the cab was really delayed.

During this time, a couple from the neighbourhood decided it was about time to get rid off of their old mattress. So, they brought it next to the dumpsters. They couldn't lift it to to throw it into the garbage ,but regardless they left it next to the trash.

Father saw that, immediately got furious and started out of nowhere yelling to the woman and the man to take that away “because who’s gonna take that?”. They explained to him that it will be taken away blah blah. Long story short, they had different opinions about the fuckin mattress and where it shall be left at.

As usual, father called this woman a “wh*re” and her husband went mad, so he lashed out to my father and he started beating the f out of him…

I was trying to part them, pulling the man off of my father who was knocked out. And guess what, instead of my mother helping, she was hysterically yelling and screaming like she was being killed “HELP HELP SOMEONE HELP AHHH” … She cannot even act in times of danger or emergency, and she was begging for someone to come and help while her DAUGHTER was trying to part two big ass men and me being hit as well in the process

No one came for help, and they were like 20 men in the corner closely watching the drama unfolding. I felt so embarrassed and furious, but I always manage myself, unlike my parents. I took them upstairs when everything was over and I had to deal with an overly dramatic shocked unreliable woman, and an injured father who always put his family in danger because of his impulsiveness.

I'm 24, I had moved out in the past, got kicked from my last job recently and trying to restabilize so I can leave them for good. I'm really sad that they grow stupider day by day and I had to return back to living with them.

Quick mention, mother is like father too. She cannot even protect herself and she instead provokes people on the road to pick up fights “becauase this man/woman looked at us in a disgusting way” . I mean, why I should even care about such parents? . Im tired of this specific toxicity and from their other behavioural problems, which apparently are being ignorant with no knowledge and completely lost in their own world. This leads them to continuously gaslight me when I open up about issues and things they did in the past. I'm on my limit. I feel trapped

Ps. I have no social life and no friends and now no job. I'm in my room 24/7 literally. Getting out only when everyone's asleep, so I can take my daily shower etc. 
I have tried therapy as well, but the docs neglected me, to the point they told me to get on meds and they fell asleep during my visits 

I think its better to remove myself completely at this point ",3,0,1744384581.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwscf8/what_to_do_with_impulsive_overly_dramatic_stupid/
1jwqkgf,I might be taking in my grandson,MiserableRutabaga532,"I (58f) and my husband (64m) have been married 10 years-together for 18.  I have no children though I spent 10 years on my 30s raising my nephew (28m).  My husband has an adult daughter (29f) that lives 7 states away from us.  Ten years ago she got pregnant.  Baby daddy went to prison.  She had the baby and chose to move back to her small hometown with her mother.  At the time we offered her and her child a home.  We had a car for her, wanted to help her get her driver's license (she still doesn't have one), go back to school, get a job and pay for daycare for her child.  She declined and went very low contact with us.  She went on to have 4 more babies.  We were never told about any of the pregnancies.  We mostly found out about them because she was on my husband's insurance and we got notices in the mail of prenatal and ultrasound visits.  Once she aged off of his insurance-we didn't hear anything.  The last (that we know of) baby was supposedly given up for adoption at birth.

My husband has met the 4 oldest children a few times.  Three years ago he retired and moved home permanently.  (He travelled for work and was more often in the area she lives in).  We have travelled to her area twice since then and have attempted to visit with her and the children.  Once we went to her apartment and nobody opened the door.  We left the gifts we brought at the door and left.  An hour later-she texted us and said she was sorry she missed us.  OK.  We tried to arrange another visit with her and it wasn't a 'good time' for her.  She had 'a lot going on.'  We never saw her or the grandkids on that visit.

We have called numerous times and asked if we could talk to the kids.  They were 'not around' or 'at their grandparents' (daddy of the second baby and of the other 3 have parents and grandparents nearby) or any number of other kinds of unavailable.  We texted her at the holidays and asked what the kids wanted/needed.  If we got an answer it was just a request for money and she would use it for them or 'toys.'  We frequently texted (She doesn't answer when we call) and asked for pictures of the kids.  No pictures.  Ever.

Two days ago my MIL called my husband.  She called his daughters other grandmother to chat.  (Daughters mother has since passed away)  Other grandmother stated she got a letter from the 'state' trying to locate relatives of the oldest child.  Apparently he is in foster care two hours away from where his mother is.  We have a call into social services and are waiting for a call back.

My husband is retired, I work full time.  We own a large home and easily have room for a child.  We are financially stable.  We have a huge family (My side) local and close who would welcome a child with open arms. We are going to try to get him if we can.  Are we too old?  He is ten.  We don't know him, anything about his physical or emotional health-but he IS our family and deserves a chance.  Are we crazy?  Do we stand a chance?  I haven't discussed this with anyone in my family yet because everything is so up in the air right now.  I would love some outside thoughts and will gladly answer any questions.  I realize this is long and complex.  It makes sense to me-but may not so someone looking in!",5,1,1744379980.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwqkgf/i_might_be_taking_in_my_grandson/

1jwj34n,My mom is thinking about divorce and I’m not sure to do.,Amazing-Visit-795,"Hi, sorry to everyone this is my first Reddit so I’m not sure how this works but I just wanted to ask for some help. My question is mainly if I should help their relationship or just mind my business. 

My mom (48) and dad (49) have been been married for almost 27 years and I cant accurately say if their relationship has always been kind of rocky since as kid I never paid attention to it. I do know that they argued in private However, these past 5 years there relationship has gotten worse especially this past year. They have been arguing publicly almost every time they’re together. And now a couple weeks ago my mom talked to me about how she is thinking about getting a divorce. 

Her reasons for the divorce: (just the main ones she says - not all)
- her husband (my dad)  never listens to what she says/asks him to do for example, he has one job in the house to do and that is to take the trash out. Which he said he will only do it if it’s tied up and placed by the front door. That doesn’t happen a lot it stays tied up by the trash can. 
 (Side note: now that my brother came back home my dad just makes him do everything my mom asks him to do. (Like the trash)
Another example
(Side note: my dad is on the bigger side when it comes to weight) so my dad eats very unhealthy and my mom wants him to eat healthier and order out fast food since its unhealthy and delivering is expensive so she started ordering those factor meals and we would have those in the fridge but then he would go an order something and she would end up being upset since she said to stop ordering when there is food in the house. 

- my mom said he doesn’t do anything for her. (Side note:My dads truck is unable to function atm so now we are all rotating vehicles)
Example she gave: (my dad) would leave the gas tank nearly empty to where its like a one way trip to work and he wouldn’t tell her before hand or just fill it up for her. (She wants him to fill up her car for her) she said he doesn’t help her with any of the laundry, car stuff, or cooking, doesn’t ask her to go out on dates or anything , doesn’t buy her anything nice anymore, he doesn’t help her out at work (side note: they work at the same place but diffrent hrs dad - 1st shift | mom -2nd).

- my mom said he has no shame/doesn’t care
(Sorry this is kinda gross)
But she said that he jus doesn’t clean the toilet seat after he is done using the bathroom and would leave dookie stains or he would pop his butt zits and there would be blood stains on there and he would leave it there and not clean it. So she would ask him to do it and he wouldn’t and he would call her a sissy. Because she said it was gross.

- last main one reason:
The way he treats her/talks to her
Example: he calls her women from time to and he thinks it’s funny so he keeps doing it. He tells her to go make him this and that. And he doesn’t say thank you or please unless she says something. My mom said she doesn’t deserve to be talked to like that or treated in that way. 
- (Side note: she has stated that she’s not happy and that he doesn’t make her laugh anymore). 

My dad used to complain to me about my mom and but me and him are not very close at the moment so I don’t know how he’s feeling right now but what he has said out loud in front of me recently is that all she (my mom) does is nag him. And that he ignores her when she talks for too long. 

I believe my mom has some valid points about my dad since I agree with them but I also know that my mom is not the best at communicating.She thinks she says everything she’s thinking but she doesn’t say everything. In the past they would call me out of my room and my dad would ask me if my mom said this or that which would help stop the argument. I also know that she wants him to do stuff without being asked/read her mind kind of but my dad is not very good at reading the room/minds and he is also bad at communicating as well. He tends to get louder if his point is not getting across which as some of us who did this (I do it unfortunately) know that this doesn’t work. 

Also, as I said they work in the same place and the coworkers that they hang out with inter lap and my mom told all of her female coworkers that know/talk to my dad that he  doesn’t do this or that and all those girls berated my dad and would say their husbands would never treat them like that. My mom said she thought by doing that he would hear other peoples opinions and maybe listen to them since he doesn’t listen to me. But i don’t really agree fully with that approach and she does a lot of things like this in the past so idk. 


My personal thoughts for their issues 
 - they don’t sleep together since he sleeps on a couch since he says laying down on a bed makes it hard to breathe at night. 
 - they don’t COMMUNICATE WELL!
 - they don’t plan anything to do 
 - all they have is work friends - like they need to be around other people get a real/good friend that they could vent to/ ask for advice (NOT VENTING TO YOUR KIDS! Which none of us are even past the age of 27 so we cant give them that much advice). 
 

I’m not sure what to do with everything that I’ve heard about their relationship. Part of me wants to help them talk it out like maybe convince them to see a marriage counselor or something? But I also don’t want to get involved anymore since divorce is serious. But my mom hasn’t been getting any happier so I think the more unhappier she gets the more she will think about divorce. Also, I’m afraid if they do get a divorce my dad will become depress and gain a bunch of weight. I know none of my siblings have a good relationship with him and they probably wont go out of their way to see him/cal him. (I’m afraid I’m in the same boat as them but I probably wont call my mom either tho).

So she I get involved and help them or stay out of it? 

Sorry if this was too long! T-T

1jwe863,"My estranged dad just reached out after years, and I’m not sure how to feel or respond. Looking for other perspectives.",MikeRotchburns6969,"Hi all,
I’m 29, and I haven’t had a real relationship with my dad since I was around 14-15. He was only in my life for maybe 6-7 years total. He reached out to me in late 2019—we talked on the phone and texted for a few months, and then he just stopped communicating out of nowhere. That silence really hurt, especially after I let my guard down. So when he eventually tried reaching out again, I didn’t respond. I felt like he was doing what he always does—showing up, then disappearing. I had to protect myself, so I pulled away.

I also strongly believe that his wife (who doesn’t like me or my sister) screens and deletes my calls and texts. They share a phone, and I’ve had a gut feeling for a long time that she’s interfering with our communication.

Fast forward to recently—he randomly texted me four messages in a row that he was in the hospital and where I’ve been, because he hadn’t heard from me.. however, last time we’ve spoke was in 2019-2020–before COVID lock down. 

It completely threw me off. I hadn’t touched my phone all day, and when I finally did, his message had come in one minute before I picked it up. On top of that, just a few weeks ago, I actually saw him at the grocery store near me (we live only two towns apart), but he didn’t see me. It gave me anxiety—I wasn’t prepared to see him in person, and it wasn’t on my terms.

Now I’m left feeling unsettled. Part of me wonders if I should respond. I’ve drafted a message that’s firm, honest, and keeps my emotional boundaries in place. It acknowledges that his absence hurt me, and that I’m not in a place where reconnecting feels right—but I also don’t want to fully close the door if one day I feel differently.

I guess my question is—am I making the right call by keeping my distance? Has anyone been in a similar position with a parent who pops in and out of your life? What helped you navigate it? I’m trying to honor my peace, but I also don’t want to carry regret.

1jwbmw9,"My younger brother is getting ""redpilled""",ThrowRA-Vegetable437,"My (24F) younger brother (21M) has become very misogynistic and racist following his breakup. He was dating this walking-red-flag girl (22? F) for about a year and a half. She rubbed off pretty much everyone the wrong way, but it was his first relationship and he was happy to be with someone ""out of his league."" 

Apparently what happened was she told him she was waiting to have sex until marriage while in reality she was treating him as a backup and hooking up with other guys. I don't know what was going on in her head, but that's the general idea from what I got. Eventually, he found out and obviously was really upset, confronted her, and her response was to break up with him and make fun of him. I didn't know until recently, but apparently she told a bunch of their friends that she wouldn't have sex with him because he has a microp*nis. I don't think that's entirely true, but it struck a chord with him and became a bit of an obsession for him apparently. 

Fast forward a few months, he has become a shut-in and is using a lot of ""redpill"" lingo about women and minorities. Frankly, in the beginning I found it somewhat entertaining to refute the made-up stuff he would repeat from anonymous accounts on Twitter, but it became more and more deranged. It all blew up last week when we were home amd he found out I had been on a couple of dates with a black guy. He started screaming stuff I will not repeat and then went into his room and was audibly crying. That's what prompted me to ask more some friends who are still in school about what is going on with him.

1jwb7xv,Parents blackmailing me with past event where I called the police?,Total_History_1884,"
England. 

17m. 

Mid Christmas last year I was in my room when my mother started having a go at me for not having a shower or something (it was something small and ridiculous) I have some chronic skin issues and it wasn’t as easy as going straight away. She stormed off and started loudly going on about how I was pathetic and how she was going to pull me out of education… god knows.

I went down stairs and yelled back that she was the pathetic one and yada yada, while yelling spit came out of my mouth, not like a pre meditated spit, but instead like flying spittle and she then launched at me for spitting at her. She then hit me on the face, it was decently hard and did leave a mark that bruised visibly. 

I pushed her off and my dad had a go at me for “hitting mum” I didn’t hit her, he then dragged me by the collar of the dressing gown hoodie I was wearing up stairs, I just put my arms in the air and said I didn’t want to fight. He then stormed downstairs, I tried to then go downstairs and calm things, something my dad admitted later that I did, however they were threatening to call the police (apparently a bluff) and my dad was dialling

Not having it I rang the police, I was in hysterics and ugly crying a bit, the guy over the phone was nice and police arrived, my dad kept yelling at me to get off the phone and coming into the room I was in. When police got to my house it was two young female officers who split up to take statements or whatever, halfway through me trying to say what happened the other one just pulled the one I was talking to out and I never got to give a full side of my story, I was then left waiting in the room for ages until another set of police arrived.

While this was happening the police women were schmoozing with my parents and laughing about our dogs (chihuahuas) and Christmas stuff. When I talked to the new policeman who showed up he did somewhat listen to my side of events but not like to write them down and he immediately afterwards just told me that a domestic report was made (still not sure what that means and if it affects me, it better not) and that I had to go to my grandmothers for the night. 

I then got in the police car, with a my dog, and went to my grandmothers, mainly feeling a little cheapened by what I thought I was getting help for. 

I got my grandmother to check and she even noticed there was a mark on my face, the police disregarded it.

Next day my dad arrived, had a go at me, didn’t listen to me and called me a “bullshitter”.

Finally got to school, late, but when I tried to text my mum to make amends she ghosted me then told me I was gonna stay at my grandmothers and wasn’t allowed to come home unless I conceded a bunch of things, stressed, and suffering from aforementioned skin issues I just gave in. Proceeding months council people rang up and apparently my mother blamed my girlfriends outburst in school, unrelated, on the incident and that it was wholly me hitter her, that apparently the police took pictures of a bruise on her neck, don’t know how I pushed her,

 just repeats of her telling me how the police wanted to arrest me and they saw it as domestic dispute and now holding it over my head in arguments that they’ll call the police and it’ll be the end of my chance at anything in life. 

I have photos of the very visible bruise that formed days later and yet she even denies hitting me. It is ridiculous. I’m tired of her and my dad holding it over my head and I don’t want it forever recorded like this when I don’t feel the police even heard me out, when I called them.

Any advice on what to do, don’t preferably want to tear apart my home just want to not be downtrodden, thanks. ",2,0,1744325593.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwb7xv/parents_blackmailing_me_with_past_event_where_i/
1jwa01o,Am I bad for wanting to cut off contact with my mother?,monkeytail321,"My mother's brain is noticeably seriously affected by excessive alcohol consumption. 
For example, she has memory problems: she can call several times a day with the same subject or question. When I tell her this, it is not true and 'I am just saying something'. She also often says things that have not really happened, but she believes them herself. She neglects herself, she does not smell fresh, has visible stains on her clothes and is incredibly thin (and I suspect that she also eats poorly). In short, she forgets or ignores all kinds of basic needs. 
She also shows no awareness that she has to adapt to the standards or expectations of different situations, which can sometimes lead to inappropriate actions or statements, and can cause uncomfortable reactions. 

All these points all fit in with an advanced stage of Korsakov's syndrome. 
Because I feel like I slowly 'lost' my mother a while ago, I no longer feel any feelings of affection for her. Because of this disease, her personality, functioning and appearance have changed so much that I no longer recognize her. 

I walked past her at the traffic light and didn't recognize her at first. When I did recognize her and spoke to her, I immediately noticed that I no longer felt a mother-son connection at all. I also had the urge to really create a physical distance between us. 

While she was going down with alcohol, we tried to help her several times. With my mother's cousin, among others, we sent her to an addiction clinic and then we completely cleaned her entire house (which was quite neglected). Because she was in the clinic voluntarily and therefore not under duress, she quickly left of her own accord. She often thought she was better again. We did this several times, sometimes she really stayed there for a while, but then she relapsed again or didn't fully cooperate. 

I don't know if it's because she doesn't recognize her own illness, is naive, or because she lacks assertiveness. But it feels like we offered her help several times, and she 'rejected' it. 

Even though it's been a few years since we helped her, I don't believe she would ever cooperate 100%. I don't really feel like trying anymore. At the moment, she doesn't have a home. She's clearly not capable enough to ever find a home herself, or to take care of herself. She's currently living with someone who takes care of her (not necessarily well), but she has a roof over her head. 

The person she's living with is old and unhealthy, so that could end at any moment. If that happens, she'll end up on the street and, if she doesn't find shelter somewhere else, she'll be a homeless person. The idea that your mother's fate is to end up homeless is very painful and that would of course make everyone very sad, including me, even though I have little to no feelings of affection anymore. 

I actually want her to get help. She needs specialized care, for example some kind of sheltered housing, but I don't want to arrange that anymore. Helping her takes too much of my energy and only gives me pain, sadness and irritation. I want distance from her and would prefer not to have any contact with her anymore.",4,2,1744322302.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jwa01o/am_i_bad_for_wanting_to_cut_off_contact_with_my/

1jw6umd,"""The drummer from def Leppard only has one arm """,Ok-Security8008,"Actually, my son's gf only has one arm, and they're expecting my 1st grandbaby in July! We're all so excited, and altho we (my mom and I) haven't mentioned anything to her, we're wondering how we can help her--if we can--with the logistics. My son said she's kinda freaked out about it, so our hearts really go out to her. 

The thing is, they've only been together like 6 months, maybe, and they were originally just friends with benefits. They've embraced this baby though, and are really making some grown up decision in preparation. 

We've only seen her 4 or 5 times in total, hence our trepidation with bringing it up with her. And it's important to know that she lost it by trying to save one of her smaller dogs from being mauled to death by a larger one, and I guess that dog tore her up. She was home alone too, so it was like an hour before anyone called for the paramedics, and she was very close to death by the blood loss. 

This incident took place almost 2 years ago. She's 25, and she's very sweet and intelligent from what we've seen. They're both exceptionally good looking, might I add, and I'm not just saying that because he's mine. 

Anyway, does anyone have any input about this sitch at all? Their baby shower is next weekend, and hopefully we can help assuage her concerns somewhat. It's not like anything we've encountered so far, but we're definitely rooting for her .

1jw0mc5,Niece in danger?,UnchilledUnfiltered,"First things first...My SIL keeps telling everyone she has ""an illness"". This illness has had every possible symptom she can fake. She's also a doc-hopper. Every doctor who tells her there's nothing wrong gets discarded after a while. This is typically also followed by a smearcampaign. She's also wasted a boatload of career opportunities due to this ""illness"".
Honestly I could care less about all that... she tricked my younger brother into taking her in by getting pregnant, keeps trying to start family fights and is basically a passive agressive manipulator. I try to keep my family far away from her drama and hypocondria.
What I do have a problem with however, is the fact that she is now suddenly convinced that my niece (5yo) has autism. She tells this to everyone she meets. Don't get me wrong, I would love hmy niece just as much with or without autism and would help her every step of the way. But... there is absolutely no sign whatsoever! I've done my research. I have a scientific background, I know what studies to read and how to interpret them.
This little girl is bossy and can be a handfull, yes, but to immediatly self diagnose her like that... idk...
My SIL feels like she does not need a doctor to confirm this, since her older child (F9, not my brothers child) has an official autism diagnosis, so she ""knows"". This child DOES show typical symptoms of autism and the difference is significant. She does not provide this child with the structure and help she needs. This child is constantly reminded that she is difficult and a burden. She, her former BF and her daughter are under supervision rn.
And now her attention has shifted to her younger child... I am afraid that she will corrupt her mind and teach her to act a certain way. She has already tried to turn her against me and my hb (hardly works, she adores her uncle 😅). I also fear that she will start giving her meds. 
My brother has tried to leave her multiple times, but she always uses their child as a threat. He's afraid he'll never get to see her again. He's a good father and the primary caregiver, even though he works at least 50-60h a week. She has no job and hardly even cooks, cleans or takes care of her children. It's an absolute mess...
Question: Could this behavior possibly be a red flag for munchausen (by proxy)? Should I allert someone? 
I don't want to be the meddling sister and I haven't been up 'till now. This latest development is scary however... I cannot interfere with her eldest since I am not related to her, but maybe I could do something for my niece?

1jvzn8h,"My dad is depressed, addicted, and tomorrow is his birthday.",sufficient_sheep_38,"For the last 15 years, my dad has been suffering from major depression and drug addiction. Opioids. I have watched him go from a strong, healthy, successful man to a shell of his former self. He used to be active, ambitious, and confident. He was a lawyer. Ran his own practice with my grandfather. He was in a long term relationship, owned a nice home, had dogs, took vacations, lived a normal life.

This all started when he injured his back, I cant even remember how. Maybe working out or something? He got a surgery which apparently made things worse, then got another surgery to correct the first one, but there was only so much they could do. Essentially, he has lived in chronic pain since the start of all this, so he went to see a pain management doctor.

I don't know the details of how much or how often the doctor prescribed the medication, but what I do know is that his medication is so strong that a single dose of what he is prescribed would kill the average person who doesn't have a tolerance to it. 

I know this because his paint management doctor told me. His doctor called me last year to tell me I needed to get my dad into rehab ""today"". Because he was concerned that my dad was going to misuse the pain medicine and kill himself. I was absolutely panicked when I got this phone call. I called my family and we had an ""intervention"" that day where we all told him how much we see him struggling and how much we all want him to get better and to go to a facility to do it. He point blank refused. Said he doesn't have a problem and he can get off the medication himself. This was December 30, 2023. He is worse now than he's ever been. 

Now he barely leaves his bedroom. He doesn't work, doesn't sleep, doesn't socialize. All he does is listen to the news and talk about how depressed he is. He makes plans and then cancels them more than half the time because his ""stomach hurts"" or he's having some other health problem. When he does show up, he's usually at least an hour late and looks so sick it takes everything in me not to do a double take. 

There is so much more, but anyway, it's his birthday soon. He is the most difficult person to buy a gift for because A. Due to being successful in the past, he's financially able to do whatever he wants, so he literally has 3 of everything he could ever need. B. He doesn't do or like anything anymore, hasn't for many years, so I feel like whatever I get him is a waste. He's recently opened gifts I've given him and then left them at my house, not even pretending to want them. I use to try to get him experiences when he was still leaving the house on a regular basis, but that won't work these days either. 

He has also been the most generous to me that someone could ever be. I am his only child, and he has made sure that I want for nothing, so I always feel like I need to get him something amazing or over the top, but it's gotten to the point where I'm so sad and angry to watch him literally slowly kill himself that I don't even want to get him anything. 

Idk what to do. I can't help someone who won't help themselves, but I cant not participate in his life because of everything hes given me. It's a shitty situation.",2,1,1744296257.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jvzn8h/my_dad_is_depressed_addicted_and_tomorrow_is_his/

1jvnfmc,I am in my hometown for my wedding and I am having a panic attack. Need urgent advice.,Prestigious_Copy9030,"I’m in my hometown for my wedding, and I just had the worst panic attack. I don’t even know where to begin.

I’m the middle child between two sisters. My elder sister has always been the golden child, while I’ve often felt overlooked by my parents. This panic attack was triggered by something that might seem small, but it felt like the last straw.

I had booked a makeup artist that I was really excited about. My sister also wanted to book one, and she decided to go with the same artist. Due to a sudden date change (which wasn’t my decision), we had to reschedule everything, including the makeup artist. Unfortunately, I didn’t rebook in time—neither did my sister—but for some reason, I was the only one blamed when we realized it was too late. The makeup artist stopped responding, even though she had our deposit.

For the past two days, my younger sister has been trying to get in touch with her. Since I have diagnosed anxiety and tend to be very detail-oriented, I kept asking my younger sister for updates—maybe too many times, but I was respectful in how I asked. I just felt anxious that something important to me was slipping away.

When I finally expressed that I was upset about my event being affected, my elder sister got angry, saying it wasn’t a big deal. She suggested I take the appointment if only one of us could be accommodated. I even offered to reimburse her for her makeup, but she said she didn’t want to go early anyway.

The problem is, she never lets me express any emotions. She always dismisses my feelings by comparing them to hers—especially since our grandfather passed away during her wedding. Anytime I share my stress, she turns it into “my wedding was worse, so you have no right to complain.” It feels like she has patented emotions, and I’m not allowed to have any.

I made a mistake by asking my younger sister about the photographer in front of my family. My dad, as usual, lost his temper and told me to stop bringing it up, saying he’d rather just pay for another artist than hear me talk about it. That hurt me deeply. It’s not about money—I just really wanted this particular artist, and now I have no backup. My event is tomorrow.

Maybe I was wrong to ask so much, but I wasn’t trying to be difficult. I just have severe anxiety, and I kept asking because I was desperate for reassurance. My sister then told me, “We all try to accommodate you, but you’re always problematic.” That broke me.

I wasn’t trying to cause problems. I wasn’t asking for money back. I was just anxious and overwhelmed. And when I was alone, I had a full-blown panic attack—I couldn’t breathe, and I didn’t have my medication with me. I didn’t tell anyone.

I feel like my parents have always treated my sister like she can do no wrong, while I’ve spent my whole life feeling diminished by her. I feel like I can’t say or suggest anything without it going through her first. I feel suffocated.

I came back hoping that, for once, this weekend would be about me. That maybe I could express my stress and feel supported. But now I feel completely lost. My sister calls me selfish and says I always create problems, that I should just put on a fake smile because everyone is here for me. But how can I, when I feel like I don’t even have space to exist?",7,7,1744252121.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jvnfmc/i_am_in_my_hometown_for_my_wedding_and_i_am/

My little sister ( which this story is about)talked to me like I was less of a human being, Just like before I started to s/h which also had a part in the worsening of my depression.( mind you while I was in the worst part of this journey and had to be moved down stair she treated me good and not mean at all) Before this Insadent I have been treated poorly and called many things almost if not every day but today She had asked to to come to a creek with her, I didn't want to but because she asked I did. When we got down there it was wet and muddy, I wanted to go back very bad. She said that I have to push myself out of my comfort zone and that she had done it all year ( first thing starting the incident and first reason she said not explicitly that she was better then me) after that there was a  electrical wiar on the ground and I was a little scared, especially sence I had almost fell down multiple times while over there all ready, she got mad that I wasn't comeing and after she gabbed the wair with her foot and after I went over and wiar started to lecture me about how bad I was and how I was being too scared ( second unexpleced reason) and needed to stop ""acting like [       ]"" (third) our 8 year old sister. She continued all the way up to the house, mocking me when I told her to stop and asking her why she was to mad at me (fourth) When we got to the house she continued to be mad and lecture me untill she opened the door and saw dad. She stopped, still being rude but no longer going off on me and when I told her to not do this she said ""no"" and and continued to untill she was in her room. A couple minutes later I went in her room to tell her that was extremely rude and not to do that again, she didn't care, and wouldn't let me finish then she told me to get out of her room and that she did nothing( Fifth) . End of inncident. Am I wrong for being mad at her and wanting to bring it up to our father? And did she do anything wrong? , if anyone has any advice please share. We live in the same house and although I'm nearing my last year of high school, I don't know If I can deal with this everyday.

1jvjfes,How Do You Stay Close to Family While Honoring Your Own Needs?,HeyZenie,"💬 Group A: Stay Close—But Set the Boundary

**Argument:** You can love your family and still say no. True closeness isn’t about constant access—it’s about mutual respect, even when you make space for yourself.

**I Skipped the Family Group Chat—And Survived**   ­Tina had always felt responsible for keeping the peace in her family. But after her baby was born, she was overwhelmed. When the group chat started buzzing with drama, she chose to mute it—and felt instantly lighter. She worried she’d be seen as distant, but instead, she started showing up more present and peaceful when she *did* engage.

**Sunday Dinners, On My Terms** ­Eli grew up going to his parents’ every weekend, no questions asked. But as work and parenting got harder, he started resenting the obligation. He talked to his mom about doing dinner every *other* Sunday—and to his surprise, she understood. Now, when they gather, it feels like a gift instead of a chore.

💬 Group B: Keep Showing Up—It’s Worth It 

**Argument:** Family relationships aren’t perfect, but they’re worth tending to. Sometimes it’s less about pulling away and more about learning how to stay connected while staying grounded.

**I Called My Mom Before She Could Text:** Jess used to dread the constant “when are you visiting again?” messages from her mom. Instead of avoiding them, she flipped the script. She called her mom first—and started opening up about how tired and stressed she was. That honesty shifted their dynamic. Her mom became more supportive instead of demanding.

**The Five-Minute Rule:** After a big falling out, Marcus wanted to reconnect with his sister—but not dive all the way in. He started small: sending memes, voice notes, or five-minute check-in texts. It wasn’t deep at first, but it felt safe. Over time, those micro-moments helped rebuild trust without overwhelming either of them.

1jve5m7,I don't really know how to emotionally move forward in life from this.,AbjectCampaign4816,"Hello, Reddit! It is my first time posting in this forum. I feel like I need some advice from people who have experience something similar regarding family dynamics and sibling abuse, so if you even take the time to read this post, I will feel at least some sort of acknowledgement. 

Please note that English is not my first language, therefore this post will most definitively have some spelling, grammar and expression mistakes. Forgive me for this. Nonetheless, I feel it is important to get this out into the world, regardless of how many mistakes I make along the way.

As the aforementioned paragraph says, this post will deal with a lot of unhealthy dynamics within the family and some forms of physical and psychological abuse. If these topics are of trigger to you, please reframe from keep reading. This can hurt you, and your mental health comes as a priority in all times. Keep yourself safe and take care of yourself. 

My sister (32F) and I (26F) have always had a complicated dynamic. I was born with complications regarding some benign tumour that had to be removed when I was very young still, at 2 years old. After the operation took place, I had several aftereffects, such as loss of mobility on the whole left side of my articulations and loss of the ability to walk, that had to be dealt with for an extended period of time. Amongst these ways of treatment was homed physiotherapy, which included activities such as swimming, walking, playing as much as I could so I can get physical movement around my whole body and try to recover.  
This part is one thing that I learn the day that I spoke to my mum, the day that I wanted to speak about the events that I will explain in further paragraphs: That my sister had to take most of the initiative into getting me to walk, play around and do physical stuff, by in most cases taking little pushes from my back so I could get up on my on and walk. I'm not quite sure if it was something that was meant to be done in favour of my recovery, but my mother believed it to be so, and doctors explained to her that it was okay for my sister to do such things.

Apart from this treatment and operation (during which period, according to my mum, my sister expended alone with my grandparents in a household where my grandmother had all the saying and decision-making, and led to my sister developing unhealthy habits and coping mechanisms for communicating her needs and worries), my sister and I were raised equally. We were raised in a very grateful and welcoming family that will hear us and be for us in anything we might need or be helped with.

These following events are a collection of very distanced and blurry recollections of what was happening at those times, as well as some not-so-much detail recollections of what my sister was going through at the time, so take these following paragraphs with a whole container of salt.

When I was mid-ages 7-8, I started receiving physical reprimands from my sister for not properly do the chores around the house with her, while our parents were out for work near our house, on a greenhouse of their own (they both were self-employed at the time, and my dad had to help my mother keep the greenhouse flowers every day, especially on Saturdays), so If I needed some sense of security from someone, I had to physically leave the house and walk to where they were, staying there so I wouldn't have to deal with the physical damage and screams from my sister, until it was time to get back home.  
Every time these events would happen, my parents would talk to my sister on the dinner table at dinner time and say to her what was wrong with that behaviour, but it didn't go far from this that they would stand up for me, so I opted for keeping going to the greenhouse every time this happened to feel a sense of temporary relief.

This happened every Saturday morning, from the moment my sister woke up (11 am) to mid-afternoon (2pm, when it was time for lunch all together).

These physical reprimands would be slaps across the cheeks, strong enough that I will cry and eventually sooth myself out so cleaning could be dealt with around our home. 

When we were about the ages of 12 (me) and 18 (my sister) years old, she started these series of ""jokes"" which including inappropriately touching my breasts and butt out in front of my family, saying things like ""Lily (not real name), what a delightful ass you have"", or ""you have some soft and big breasts, sis"" while touching my areas. I would then react immediately by getting away from her grip, saying out loud 'Stop' to her face and begging for my family to do something. Again, it would end in some verbal light reprimand and it would be forgiven, no matter how much env arrased or violated I would feel afterwords.

This led me into a mindset that forced me into believing, for a very long time, that family is not someone to hold a grudge against, because no matter what they would do to me, it was for a reason. I was not comfortable with this mindset, and I know now that in fact it is not the case at all, but it was the mentality that allowed me to survive all the years my sister kept on living with my family and I.

Through years of self-reflection, I now know that although I also made many mistakes with getting back to my sister (I would learn to respond to her physical abuse with verbal abuse, judging her type of mentality and acts like something to reprimand and despise. I hurt her a lot, because I felt at the time that it was the only way to feel some sense of justice, to now realized that I only caused her more pain along the way that she stills battles with), I didn't deserve any of that sort of treatment.

So I tried spending the time that my mind and hart allowed me to, to hang out with my sister along with my parents, thinking that enough time and thinking had passed since this sort of reactions could have ever repeated themselves nowadays.

I was wrong.

My sister visited us by the end of March this year. She came to visit after asking for some vacation leave to her workplace now in Switzerland, and came to spend some time in our country, Spain, and our home. She was planning on doing a lot of things together, while visiting us every day for at least an hour and hang out with our grandmother and grandaunt (they now live with my parents, since is much safer for them to be around our parents and live more relaxed and cared for).

On Thursday that week, my sister wanted my mother and me to go shopping and spend some time together, so we arranged that they would let me know via text when would they be arriving to the entrance of the city I live with my partner since three years ago (a 20 minute drive from where my family lives), so I could be ready on the road waiting to get in the car together with them so they didn't have to wait a long time for me to get ready.

The journey started with them not letting me know when they arrived at the entrance of said city. Instead, they let me know they were at my door and they were waiting. Once I get on the car, after some time and while we were arriving at the shopping centre, my sister started lashing at me about our decision to move our of the family house to be an independent couple living together, and that we were 'wasting money' instead of just moving into the 'empty' house in which our grandmother used to live before our granddad died (she still goes every afternoon to do chores and watch TV, amongst other things). I tried to argue that it was something that we were looking forward to doing even if it was economically challenging and that, even if it meant not saving as much money as in any other household situation, we were really happy about our decision, but my sister tried to keep imposing that it was a dumb decision, by which point I started saying that If we weren't willing to listen to neither of our opinions, that I would prefer to end the conversation. They raised their shoulders in disbelieve and said that it would also meant for me to try and listen to their arguments, but I was not up to it if it means standing arguments in an imposing and judgemental manner, not actually listening to my accounts and taking things from their perspective only. (I tend to also do that a lot when it means talking matters with my family, I am also to blame for that sort of habit with them).

At some point in the shopping trip, we were starting to consider to get back home, but not without visiting one last shop. This part is still very vivid in my head and body, and will be the most descriptive of all.

We were at this store looking at some accessories for hair and hair claws, when some girls intended to come into the shop where we were somewhat crowded, and it so happened that they entered by where we were standing, so they pass behind us. My sister and mum were around me by this point (my mum to my left, my sister to my right, somewhat behind), so my sister let the girls in by stepping forward and bumped into my back. When this happened, I feel her hands holding my ass for far too long of a time, saying to almost just us that 'my ass was very firm'. My mother was by my side, and I went furious on the insides, but hold composer due to the crowed of people that surrounded us, and that in that moment I didn't want to raise concerns to anyone, counting that my mother could have seen or heard all that have happened, and that I told my sister at that moment to Stop, by saying her name loud and firm while getting away from her grip.

After some thought on what happened that day and the acknowledgment that the touching happened again so many years later, in plain sight out in public, I confide into my partner's parents my worries about how my parents could react if I were to tell them what happened and that it was the same behaviour they were aware of years prior to my sister's independency. They were very wellcoming, aknowledging that of my sister's behaviour throught the years as far from acceptable, and that I should talk things through to my parents in order to have their side and, from there, being able to make a decision as to what sort of relationship I wanted with my sister from now on.

The conversation took place this last Sunday, when I visited to have lunch with my parents and grandmother and grandant alltogether, while my partner stayed home due to the conflict of not being able to do anything to remedy the situation but to hear my side of the situation.

The conversation took place without my grandma and grandaunt present at that moment. My mother spoke the whole time they wanted to say their side. My dad was silent all the way through, and even stepped outside of the house and came back after some moments. My mother said that it was really bold and irresponsable for me to implie there was an abuser in our family (refering to my sister and her behaviour), and that I should be aware of how these acts would other members of the family feel about me accusing my sister of such things (I didt'n say abuser at any point of the conversation, and limit myself to explain about the events of Thursday afternoon and their similarities with what my sister used to do to me in front of them, things they were made awared of when I spoke out about them right when they happened). That I needed to fix things with my sister if I felt I had a problem with her, and that she doesn't understand how could I see those touchings as abuse, because all she was able to see was a form of care and affection.

I don't really know how to react to this sort of mentality regarding abuse and my own experience with my sister. I feel denied from all validation from my family. I love them, but I really don't understand the perspective of taking signs of abuse as 'affection'. How can I move past this mentallity? I still love my family and love them deeply, but it really hurts that they are backing my sister, my 32 year-old-sister, on this one.

I have still an appointment with councelling on June, planning on seeing if there are chances of rescheduling for some date earlier than then. 

I don't know what steps to take to solve this barrier without it distroing my integrity with my own sence of self respect. I feel like if I just at least have some more aknowledgement, it would motivate me enough to keep working on myself and on getting to work my feelings out. Right now, just hearing about my mum, or hearing her speak, hurts a lot. I know she doesn't have a fault on this, and that my sister is a daughter of hers too, but it hurst a lot.

1jvcow1,My mom won’t support me staying in the city for the summer and I’m feeling defeated,,"I’m 20 and currently living in the city for school. I was offered a summer job here making $18/hour, 40 hours a week, and I really want to stay for the summer to work, gain independence, and keep building my life here. I found a place to rent for $800/month and I was excited but I needed a co-signer.

I told my mom about it and asked if she’d be willing to co-sign. She immediately said no. Said staying in the city “won’t be good for me at all,” and that I won’t be able to save any money on $18/hour. She basically shut the whole thing down and made it clear she doesn’t support me staying even though I’m not asking her to pay anything, just to co-sign.

She said I’ll have to “find someone else” to co-sign, which honestly hurt. She doesn’t treat me like an adult at all, even though I’m trying to make adult decisions. Every time I try to have a real conversation with her, it turns into her making assumptions, doubting me, or even telling the extended family about our disagreements.

I feel really discouraged. I want to be independent and take responsibility, but it feels like I’m being punished for it. I guess I just needed to vent. Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you push forward when your own parent didn’t believe in you?

Live at home with my mom and brother who is a few years older. For the last year or so my brother has been commenting on my parenting. And whenever he does so he throws in an insult or smart comment. Don't get me wrong, I know he loves my kid and they're best friends. But he says that I'm not a mother and that I don't know how to be a parent and his main thing is I don't do anything.....just because I don't help around the house. I work full time. All my child's needs are taken care of by me. I give him baths, brush his teeth, throw out his overnight diapers, fix him food, go grocery shopping, take him to and from daycare, am always home when he's home, take him to the doctor, etc. But because I don't help ""around the house"" he says I'm not a mother. Him and my mom have never asked me to do anything so it's not like they've asked a favor and I've said no, it's more he wants me to be like hey mom do you want me to do this for you. Also neither of them work while again I work full time. Yes my mom does my dishes and laundry and my brother uses that but you can't say im not a mother and I do NOTHING. And here's the kicker.....she washes his clothes and dishes too....but he thinks its different because again he doesnt work so he has like 2 outfits in the wash at a time. But.....she washes his clothes and dishes too so I don't get how he can use that against me. I also pay hundreds of dollars in rent a month.

Maybe it’s just me but I would think if you have to have sex seven times in one night then obviously you’re not satisfying your girlfriend’s needs. What do y’all think?

1jv1usp,I did not invite my father to my wedding,Unfair_Mark7618,"Recently got married. Unlike other wedding preparations, mine was quite smooth — no hiccups except for one thing, deciding whether to invite my Father and his side of the family or not.

For context, though I grew up without him at home, I didn’t have any resentments or hate towards him. My Mama was kind enough to not tell me stories about what actually happened between them. Until recently, when I posed the question to my Mama if it would be okay with her to invite him. 

Mama then told me the ugly truth. Despite this, I still wanted him to be present sa wedding. Even as a guest. 
Because honestly, deep inside, I long for a moment to have a complete family. 

However, I thought of all the years my Mom has kept her silence and the horror of the words spoken by my Father when she got pregnant. 

And so my mom pleaded and told me not to invite him. I respected her decision. After all, she was the one who faced all the hardship of raising me and my siblings. 

Yet, in my deepest and darkest thoughts, I imagine the day walking down the aisle with my father. He must’ve been proud, he must’ve been happy.

Maybe in another lifetime.

1jv0ir2,my dad cheated on my mom,Naivelilyb,"january 2025, our grandmother (mom’s mom) died. we as a family travel to PH to bury grandma. during this time, my dad takes a trip out to his providence which is a normal endeavor for him. he usually goes once a year solo for a festival and to visit his family’s land and we thought nothing of it. he ends up leaving his phone at the manila airport and me and my sister pick it up.

we go through his phone and find he’s been messaging a woman named lilia for more than seven years. he sent her custom happy valentines day roses off etsy and got my mom a bouquet from ralphs. 

weeks after this happens, we tell our mom. she cries more than a few times about it. she says this is the saddest she’s been in her entire life and often asks how her life ended up this way. i don’t know when but she recently decided to speak to him about it. it clear she is frustrated with him but is more concerned with circumstances. my dad is the breadwinner of the family. my sister is entering nursing school and completely reliant on them for funding. as for myself, i just got diagnosed with a second autoimmune disease and have to rely heavily on them for finances, healthcare, and transportation. my sister and i are in our 20s. additionally, in ph culture, it is absolutely looked down upon to divorce. 

upon that, i heard them talking last night. he told her that he stopped the affair completely, but then quickly snapped at her when she continued to ask about it. he called her “putangina” (bitch) multiple times and i heard her cry. he doesn’t hit her but he stomps around and clicks his tongue like he’s a child. he wanted her out of the room but she refused. i can’t speak tagalog but i could recognize he was telling her to stop bringing it up. 

im concerned he might get violent or she might fall into a depression. he hasn’t ever been violent before but he’s always been quick to anger. upon that, i know you’re supposed to feel nothing but anger and resentment toward your father in times like these, but before this, he told us recently how he feels overworked and stressed and i feel like this pressure is building up and could lead to something terrible.

i want to dilute the situation but i don’t know how to approach anyone without it looking like im picking sides or making excuses. my mom doesn’t have a lot of friends/support in america. she’s introverted and generally not a very good communicator. i don’t know how to comfort her appropriately. if anyone has any suggestions let me know. her star sign is cancer. she likes action and romance movies.

1juzral,my psychopath father ruined our family's life. what do i do?,seowoojinie,"i (17F) am sick of this person, my father (50M). he has been the worst to my mother since day one. he has been physically, verbally  and emotionally abusive to her. even when she was pregnant with me and my sibling, (14F), she dealt with all his shit alone.the abuse was as brutal as him breaking my mother's ribs when she didn't 'react the way he wanted'. he even cheated on her multiple times with different women, is probably cheating right now with a woman we know. he even lied to her and went out drinking and partying when my sibling and i were little. 
after one of the recent cheating incident, which happened at a party, my mother told him that he shouldn't have done this in public, and in return, he smashed my mom's face in the car steering, scratched her hand and kept on yelling while driving her to our house.
the next day i got involved when they started fighting. he lifted his foot to kick my mother in a fit of rage and i slapped him. i was DONE.
i was done seeing my mother be treated like this. mind you, my mother is a working women, very well respected in our city. she didn't do anything to deserve this. she's always been respectful to everyone else. she mostly ignores my father because of his constant rude behaviour, which according to my father, is the reason he's become like this.
yesterday, my mom came home yelling at him on call. the fight was because of something at their workplace, which my mom took full responsibility for. my father kept saying how he always has to clean up everyone's mess, even when there was no mess to clean. my mother handled the situation perfectly and that caused absolutely no losses to him. when my mom told him that she'd taken care of it, he literally said ""take my dick from the back"".
because of this, my mom told him not to talk to her in that tone and that she doesn't want to live with such a toxic person and hung up. he came home and started arguing again. he kept on barking about why she had to tell me and my sister about this. i sent my mom to her room and he kept on insisting that he wasn't such a bad person. he kept bringing up how 'family doesn't act like this' and 'we should all try to solve this together'. i said there was nothing to solve and that i want them to get separated. mind you, he's always been the kind of person who'd yell at me for taking my mom's side. he even said ""you and your mother are trying to distance me from my daughter"" as if i wasn't also his daughter. whatever, i don't really care about my relationship with him because i already despise him. but i absolutely hate it when he comes to emotionally blackmail me with everything he 'did' for his daughters. it's just emotionally exhausting. i have my exam in 20 days and he doesn't seem to care about it and keeps on ruining our peace.
since yesterday he's been trying to change our mind about the divorce.he keeps trying to persuade us and when we deny, he tries to dominate us by throwing rage fits and yelling at us. even this morning, as soon as i woke up, he barged into my room trying to change my mind (AGAIN). i absolutely couldn't stand him and yelled at him quite a few times. he said that this is not how i talk to him. the moment he came in, i already told him i didnt wanna talk at all, kept saying that he should go and let me do my thing. 
he was the one who pushed me to this point. i somehow managed to push him out of my room by saying to keep his bags packed, and if another fight breaks out, he will leave without arguing.
he came back an hour later, saying that this family was the best thing that happened to him and that this is all resolvable. i told him to stfu and go, so he did.
i haven't told mom about any of this because she's at work right now. i don't wanna live with a narcissistic psychopath like him who always tries to manipulate us into doing whatever keeps his reputation intact in the eyes of the world.
what do i do?

I do find it really challenging to deal with my grandmother, especially since she loves to yell and loves to argue with people, especially me in the house. anyways, I have been telling my therapist all about this and he recently told me that he’s thought about reporting to CPS or APS because he is a mandated reporter. APS has been called to my house before for my grandmother with elderly abuse.

1jup0hv,"my mother is an alcoholic and it's ruining her life, and mine",Cheap-Creme-7313,"hello, i'm 22 (F), and it's my first time ever posting on reddit.

my mother is ruining her life, and mine as well.

my mother has been an alcoholic for a very long time, i don't think i can even remember a time when she wasn't one.

since a young age, i've taken upon the role of taking care of her when she was drunk, making sure she wouldn't hurt herself, taking off her makeup or putting her to bed when she couldn't do it herself, ect.

my father wasn't a really good husband or a good father, never helped much and probably caused more harm than good. he was mentally ill as well, though it doesn't excuse the way he treated us.

like a lot of children, i tried fixing my parents' issues, putting myself in situations i shouldn't have been a lot of time. i did everything to maintain some stability in an environment that had none.

after my father died 2 years ago, i thought things would change for the better, but it didn't.

his death broke me to pieces, it was very traumatizing the way it happened, but at the same time it felt like maybe things could finally get better for us. 

for a while things were okay, my mother was still drinking but it wasn't out of the ordinary. i asked her to quit, but i knew it wasn't that easy.

but for the past few months, the situation has gotten worse and worse, and worse.

my mother always had quite the temper and pretty bad moodswings, alcohol doesn't help. when she's drunk she gets vey loud, agressive and sometimes violent. i've tried talking about it with her, she knows she has a problem, she just doesn't want to talk about it, ever.

she's slowly ruining her life, spending all of her money in both alcohol and cigarettes, not taking care of her health while she's been coughing more and more as time passes, ruining all of her relationships.

she also suffers from diabetes, which makes everything 10x worse.

i don't know what to do anymore, she's all i have left, and i'm all she has left. i've been hurt by her so many times in the past, both physically and mentally and i'm exhausted, i'm slowly reaching my limits. sometimes i hate her, i hate her so much it hurts, and she hates me as well, she has said it herself. but then i remember how badly she's been hurt in the past, how unhappy she really is and how she tried to be a good mother.

many friends have told me to walk away, distance myself so she can't hurt me anymore, let her face the consequences all by herself but i can't bring myself to let her go.

i want to believe there's still hope, that she can get help and become a better mother. i want to believe it's not too late.

1jum1ax,Should I move out,VoiceSuspicious3879,"I (20f) live with my parents. I dont have a drivers license yet but working on that. I am also in a 1.5yr relationship with my boyfriend (m22) who also lives with his family. My relationship with my boyfriend is wonderful and he always encourages me to do my best. He is very selfless when it comes to helping me with anything, whether it's offering solutions to daily problems to as far as having me move in with them to improve my mental and emotional help from my parents.
I have a younger brother who is 19 and my relationship with him I would say is about normal. We both attend online school with a tech school with high end tuitions (we're not rich, had to file for the FASFA). We also work part time, but i work more than him because his classes are more demanding for time. I pay the home electricity and he pays the internet because our mother wanted us to have an understanding of bills, which we both already knew because we have our own. I graduate in September and turn 21 in a month from now. My relationship with my parents I dont think is horrible but definitely could be better. My father has PTSD and BPD (borderline personality disorder) and some other issues, who gets easily pissed off. In the past when we were younger he was more aggressive and threw things but never harmed any of us. When we moved to our current town 7yrs ago, with a new scenery and change of pace he gotten better especially with therapy for a few years. My mother has a very technical mind where as long as everyone is fed and housed everyone's fine. She still has the mindset since she was younger, but in the past year or so she's worked on herself to better understand my father and me and my brother. Shes not a very emotional or empathetic person, but she tries to help in some ways. She says I'm alot like my father mainly in downing myself and tending to bring up past things, and a few other things. But I'm very emotional, understanding and very kind spirited; the smallest topic that really bothers me will make me tear up for no reason. 
Onto the point. The past 6 months or so has been stressing bc my father didn't want to drive anyone, mainly me, to and from anymore bc I'm not appreciative of him doing so (he's been the ""human taxi"" since I was young). I've managed to find rides thanks to my coworkers and sometimes my boyfriend when he's able to due to him working fulltime. I would hear my parents go back and forth about me and my relationship and my future, mainly hearing dad. He would say things like how I'm throwing everything I've worked for by being with my boyfriend who doesn't really have a career in mind. (My bf said he's the type to work whatevers needed and wants us to be long term bc of how well our relationship is compared to our past ones od being used. I tokd him it bothers me he has nothing really planned for himself, to which he said theres some things he wants to do but takes money like  anything else). My father would also say how I'm selfish for things like still buying crap (which I hardly do anymore except for snacks like once a month and a few packs of whatever single Pokemon card packs I see bc that's my hobby), and how I proclaim about eventually moving in with my boyfriend's family. Me and him finally got into an argument a few weeks ago and let everything out. My parents never liked my boyfriend simoly because of how immature he was back in our freshman year of high school...WHO ISNT AT THAT AGE?? And how obsessed he was with his then girlfriend. They call him narcissistic and a f**boy because of the couple of girls hes been with, and the moment he gets ""intimacy"" from me he'll leave like most other guys. Little do they know I gave my v-card to him the mid last year and it's been a year later and we're still amazing.
 I know my folks want the best for me like any other parent who wants their children to succeed. My mom religiously tells me to keep saving to get a car, obviously used for a first time car, and to save for my own place and for me to stay living with them til I'm able to do so. I told her and my bf I feel like I'm on a time limit about the car thing bc what if soon after I graduate I need to drive an hour away or move to a different area for my new career, yk? My parents proclaim how they're so proud of me and my brother bc of our school successes, and keep us on track to do good and keep us from the riffraff bad kids. They were more concerned with us doing good in school and having a ""good childhood"" that they didn't really teach us anything as we got older. They were more supportive of me when I was little than throughout highschool up til now. I don't feel supported for making certain decisions. My father is really clinging to us because he doesn't have anyone left in his side of the family now after my grandmother passed away in October from cancer that she miraculously survived 4-5yrs after her original diagnosis. Like my mother said, as he clings more to us, I feel he's also pushing us away because of how he's going about it. Like I tell my boyfriend and some trusted coworks is that I have more emotional issues with my father than my mother, but both seem to not want to understand things from another point of view. In the emotional and mental side of things, I feel like because  of their disinterest of understanding me not only as their daughter but as an adult, I feel pushed away from the things my father says as if he has no faith in me. From either of them I don't feel respected as an adult in my home simply because ""it's our house and you will respect us"". Yes I get that, and always have but they don't do the same. They say how im wanting to be an adukt but still act like a child and they dint want to deal with it. They dint realized that young adults even uo til like 25yrs old still need support and guidance from their parents. They say im childish because of who im with and my tendencies to buy pokemon cards and still try to hangout with old friends. They blame my boyfriend for how I've been; how much more of an attitude I've had, how I'm ""disrespectful"". Witnessing and hearing him and his mother argue sometimes or what we talk about tells me more about a better way of resolving things. When They argue they eventually apologize and find a solution, while my parents grow more distant because of miscommunication. That's not me saying my boyfriend's family is better, everyone has their own family problems. My boyfriend and I have serious talks, not arguments, about life things, what needs to change, me needing to move out to have my peace again, my driving and license issues, etc. I know it would be wise and mature to buy my own car and buy or rent my own place, but I don't make enough for either after paying the house electricity and my bills, I'm lucky enough to theoretically make $300 payments for a car but people want more a month or buy it outright in cash, neither I can currently do even with $800 saved, $200 thanks to my mom. 
I just need to know if I really should move out. I originally planned to after graduating and move in with my man, but even he says it's getting worse the longer I let it go on. I told him other than not having my own vehicle yet and have to worry about getting to and from work bc they live 15mins away while we live 5mins from work, the only other thing that's holding me back is that daughter guilt. The guilt of the bill I pay for falling on my brother or my mom being in the red after paying it every month, or something happening between my parents, or if somethings happens in my relationship and I'm not welcome back home and hear ""I told you so"" by everyone. My man re-re-reassures me that won't happen bc of how healthy our relationship is, but I cant help but feel unsure about literally EVERYTHING in my life. I'm not even fully confident in my career choice and it going anywhere and be stuck with the loan debt like most people nowadays. 
I would really appreciate some advice (sorry for the long story lol)",1,0,1744139980.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jum1ax/should_i_move_out/
1jui7k0,My family member keeps getting shit relationships and I'm worried about her kids.,KeyEntertainer4117," I (30f) have a family member we'll call her lily (33f)who is a single mum to two girls (13f 8f). I've known lily for about ten years now and is on my husbands side of the family. Lily was 'black sheep, blacklisted etc' from the family for staying with an abusive man when she was in her late teens and had her children removed by social because of this relationship. Since I've known her she has had a constant flow of relationships sometimes talking to multiple men at the same time. She has been in a dv refuge 3 times and had social services involved in and out for the last 7 years for two girls but they remain with her. I don't know how to help her. She finally started counselling (although not sure how good it is being nhs counselling) and she has been diagnosed with a serious mental health disorder. She has done every dv related course under the sun. She lives about 4 hours from me and I don't drive so physical support is virtually impossible. 
recently she got into a relationship with someone who is she knew was a bad person who had been virtual for a year once meeting they moved in together  but recently after being together physically for a matter of months with countless problems he SA'd her (this is not her fault obviously. Police etc are involved and she took all help given but she does have a pattern of KNOWINGLY picking the worst men) . I'm really worried about her girls growing up seeing this pattern of men and their behaviour towards women and their own mothers mental health and obvious trauma patterns in relationships and how they will grow up. The girls call every new man 'dad' the eldest remembers some horrific things done to her and her mum and is showing behaviour challenges and emotional stunted growth (I think it's trauma) and believes every man will hit her if she is naughty (my husband told her off on a recent visit and she froze in fear waiting for him to hit her)I am now in the horrific position of contemplating calling authorities.

Lily has improved over the last three years with accepting counselling and recognising patterns quicker (months instead of years) and getting out dodge(usually after the male was physcial). I'm trying to provide support where I can (phone calls, financially, advice etc) I just don't see her fixing these patterns do I give up on her, ruin our relationship and express my concerns to social or do I support where I can and help pick up the pieces?

1jugg3g,holiday/birthday acknowledgement for a mother I don't have a relationship with,Ride-Dense,"Hi all, I come to you looking for advice on gifts/general acknowledgement for my mom for the holidays - Christmas, her birthday (which is in a few days), mother's day (mid May) in particular. During my childhood, she verbally and emotionally abused my sister and I (as well as occasionally physically). We currently have an almost non-existent relationship. My sister gets her over the top stuff still (but complains about her behind her back) which obviously puts me in a weird spot to be compared to what she gifts her.

She sometimes watches my children to help us out (although my dad does the bulk of the childcare in reality). She is a generous gift giver (it's the only way she knows how to show love) - although I've had to repeatedly ask her not to get the kids so much stuff as we're trying to declutter our home slowly and she won't listen (she has gotten a little better though). I know this all sounds harsh, but she is a full blown narcissist, and it's taken me a long time to get to even this place and put up boundaries.

How do I acknowledge my mom's birthday but not make a big deal out of it or put too much time and money and effort in? She is well off and doesn't need anything, plus with this strained relationship, it drains my energy to even think about it. We're grown adults, and I have small kids, so I can't keep dwelling on this stuff yearly. HELP.

Side note - I do not mind getting my dad things, as we have an okay relationship, however they are together so this adds some complication if I'm buying him gifts and not her.",1,0,1744126342.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jugg3g/holidaybirthday_acknowledgement_for_a_mother_i/

1ju4l9y,AITAH for wanting to report my sister for elder abuse,SafeStrawberry8539,"My sister (49) currently lives with our mother. She has three girls and two of them also live with our mother. Her middle child (30) and her youngest (12). Her middle child is two months pregnant now. My sister never got along with our mother. She believes that our mother treats her differently from my siblings and I. My mother has five children. My sister is the third born. She is the middle child. She’s different from all of us. She is the only one that has gone back home to live with our parents multiple times. Her most recent return was five years ago. It was supposed to be temporary. She was escaping her second abusive marriage. She has not filed for divorce. Her middle child was already staying with our mother when my sister returned home with her youngest. Our mother is in her mid-seventies and my sister is driving her mad and causing my mother’s blood pressure to go up. My sister does not respect my mother and disregards her house rules. For example: my mother has declined her granddaughter’s request to allow her boyfriend’s dog to come to the home. My sister recently brought home a pitbull terrier to spend the night under the guise that her 12 year old was dog sitting for her dad. The youngest girl has about 3 pet turtles that she does not clean up after regularly which causes odors that my mother really hates. My mother does not want granddaughter’s boyfriend spending multiple days and nights at the house. The boyfriend was given a key. My mother is livid. My sister is also a hoarder. Her room has enough room for someone to walk into it sideways. This is a constant point of contention in the household. My father never corrects her and actually enables her behavior. She has disrespected my mother, screamed and cussed at her whenever my mother becomes fed up and tries to correct her. My mother wants her and her daughters to get out, but my father will have none of it. My sister is employed and could’ve gotten her own place but she pays for private school for my niece and money is tight. She contributes maybe $150 towards rent, but that’s actually not even a problem. It’s the disrespect, disregard, and dismissal of my mother that us four siblings really resent. We do not live there and we feel helpless. My sister says that our mother does not love her and that we also hate her. This is not true. We do not love how she treats our mother. About a year ago, we did an intervention and she cried and we all felt sorry and everyone tried to put the pieces together and move on. She got on medication for anxiety and it helped with her anger issues and we thought things were improving. Recently, after the dog incident, she threatened my mother by telling her she was going to have her committed to a hospital where no one would find her and we (her other four children) would have to take my sister to court to get my mother out of the hospital. This scared my mom because she doesn’t really know how that works and she actually believed my sister. My sister only talks to me. She does not speak to the others. Our relationship is contingent upon me not interfering on my mother’s behalf. Last time I stood up for my mother, my sister blocked me and stopped speaking to me for a year. I am angry because she does not listen to anyone except for our father who does not correct her. The strife between my mother and sister started when my sister ran away multiple times when she was 15. On one of the occasions when she ran away, my mother told my father to let her go. My father always went to find her. He would find her in a group home somewhere. I don’t remember how my sister learned that my mother did not want my dad to go searching for her when she ran away. It might’ve been me. I was 13 and I missed my sister when she would disappear in the middle of the night without saying goodbye. I never heard her leave and she never told me before she left. She would just disappear. My father would grill me but I never knew. I even got slapped once for saying I didn’t know where she ran off to. He thought I was lying. Corporal punishment was our norm, but that was the last time my father ever put his hands on me because I threatened him that day. When I was a kid, I resented my mother for telling my dad to leave my sister out there by herself. I couldn’t understand it, but I have forgiven her and I understand that my mother probably did not know what to do with my sister. My sister married her first husband when she turned 18 and subsequently came back home because he was physically abusive. That time I went and got her and brought her home. She has been leaving and returning since she was about 23/24. We’ve been dealing with this for 25 years. It’s like my sister is stuck. I left home for college and have never had to return to live since. I go there sometimes to say hello and check up on my parents. I love both of them. They did their best with 5 kids and not a lot of resources. My sister blocked me about two days ago because I stood up for our mother and told her if she didn’t stop disrespecting our mother, we would be taking legal action. She mocked me and said, “What are you going to do? Call 911? You’re going to evict me?” She said this like a whiny teenager. She acts like she’s still 15. AITAH if I join my siblings in filing a report against her for elder abuse and requesting an order of protection for my mom? We don’t know what to do. She’s out of control.

1ju2m1t,My mother hates me,Leading_Spinach7251,"This might come across as chaotic because of my state of mind, but I hope it makes sense. My mom hates me. She has a long-standing habit of exploding at me in ways that are far from kind. She’s called me countless names, and threatened to hit me, and it’s honestly unbearable. I hate yelling, it overwhelms me and she’s an incredibly loud person. I’ve tried asking her to stop, but she never does, which leaves me feeling helpless. She’s called me selfish, brainless, idiotic, and worse. Meanwhile, my twin sister, though she’s been scolded, has never been subjected to the same insults. My sister lies constantly, even about trivial things, to avoid being wrong or to shift blame. Her behavior frustrates me deeply, and I feel trapped because I can’t trust her, even when she might be truthful.

As for my mom, it’s clear she has unresolved mental health issues, but she projects them onto me, and it’s tearing me apart. I remember one night when I was hungry and added extra food to my plate. My dad agreed it wasn’t much, but she went on a tirade, calling me selfish and yelling until she stormed off. I was so drained that I didn’t even eat that night. Her double standards between me and my sister are maddening. I almost wish my sister could experience the treatment I get, just so she’d understand. And yet, after all this, my mom wakes up the next morning and acts as if nothing happened. I don't get why she gets to call me selfish and brainless and all these names in our native language when I was the one who had to step up when she decided she wouldn't cook us food a while back. I was cooking mine and my sister's lunch and breakfast (maybe) while also doing my school and not sleeping because of the stress.  
I have health issues. Severe health issues that she still hasn't brought me to a doctor for. I remember I couldn't breathe in her car because of the AC so I opened my window and she and my sister both got mad at me and forced me to close the window. They then decided to go shopping and leave me in the car without an AC. On the way back my cough was so bad that I was this close to throwing up and all she could talk about was her 'car' that she left in absolute filth with her papers and her bags everywhere. I'm so fucking tired, so so fucking tired of being so alone.

All of this is happening while my dad lives in another house, he used to be the closest thing I had to an ally in this house and now I feel like I'm trapped and villanized by everyone else.

Honestly the only thing I can use to justify all of this is the fact that she probably hates me because I just don't understand why",1,1,1744077815.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ju2m1t/my_mother_hates_me/

1jtwtw4,I (45f) am considering asking my sister to take her children.,Positive-Yam-6890,"My sister struggled with infertility for years and while trying for children, she fostered and eventually adopted 3 children. They were the answer to her prayers and she loved those children dearly, then she got pregnant and welcomed her and her husband’s first child. I would say almost instantly when she found out she was pregnant you could see the difference in how she treated the miracle kid versus the fosters. That’s how I will refer to the children just to differentiate them and have clear 
understanding.

Eventually, my sister started to have behaviors out of her foster children. Also, they were getting older and it was obvious that they have some mental issues due to their mom’s drug use. The behaviors were pretty extreme. Fighting in school, fighting each other. They would call miracle child racial slurs because they are of a different ethnicity than the family and just overall terrible behavior. At a family event, they were upset with my sister and knocked my 92 year old grandmother out of a chair causing her to break her arm. 😮‍💨😬

Then, my sister welcomed a set of twins. As you can imagine, my sister is elated with having given birthday to now 3 children! However, the treatment of the foster children continues to decline as behaviors continue to get more and more problematic. she doesn’t speak with them, instead, she tells her husband to take care of them. 

This is where I have a question. The children spend time with my husband and I from time to time. We have a very relax home, it’s just the two of us and a dog. Our child is in college. We don’t see the same behaviors as my sister’s family does. We also have time to pour into them and it seems to be effective. I am considering asking to take them permanently, but I’m not sure if I want to take that on. We feel like the kids behave because we are not with them long. This situation is a sore spot for my husband and I because it’s like we are watching a car accident happen in front of us. It’s not much we can do but we want to do something. They live about 4 hours away so it’s difficult to get them often, a more permanent move would be better. We see how they struggle with self esteem and genuinely don’t feel they are loved and accepted.  Any advice?

1jtsgsq,MIL has replaced photos of my daughter with newest grandchild,Proper_Flower_7459,"Before I get into it- I realize how dumb & petty it is for me to be upset over this. This goes beyond “first world problems”, I know that. But I can’t deny that I am bothered by it & so I’m seeking advice for how to be unbothered. 

My daughter (1 yr) is the first grandchild in the family. Everyone has been absolutely smitten over her since she was born, and my MIL used to have a few photos of her framed around their house. My SIL (MIL’s daughter) gave birth to a boy, now the second grandchild, a little over a month ago. Since his birth it’s like my daughter has been tossed aside and replaced with my new nephew. MIL has removed all but 1 photo of my daughter in their house and has *replaced* them with photos of the new baby, even adding 4-5 of SIL’s brand new family photos they just took last week (My husband & I also had family photos taken after my daughter’s birth that were never displayed). I can’t help but feel pretty hurt over this. I’m not saying I expect all the attention to be solely on my kid anymore-obviously not. But MIL has made it quite obvious which of her kids/grandkids she prefers now. I get adding photos of the newest addition- but replacing the existing photos of her granddaughter?? wtf is that about? MIL & my daughter have always been really, really close too, but now it seems like she doesn’t want much to do with her. Luckily my daughter is too young to notice or it would break my heart even more. 

I hate that this even takes up space in my brain but I’m so bothered by it.

1jtoz30,What should I do?,Reasonable_Tear_3104,"My father has a tendency to yell when he gets mad about something. He usually also bangs things such as a table or cabinets whenever he get's angry. He yells at me for small things such as staying up too late, forgetting to mention where I would go and also if I ""talk back"" which is just me voicing my opinions. 

Two months back I was grounded for staying up late, and during the time I was grounded he told me to go outside. I thought it was stupid, but I didn't pay attention to it. He went to another country for the weekend, so I thought I would just go to the store to buy something. I asked my step-brother who was watching us if I could go, and he agreed. So I went to the store. When I got back, my dad texts me to ask where I went (he has cameras so he can see what our pet dogs do) so I tell him where I went. I don't think much of it.

He comes back and asks to talk to me. He proceeds to ask which friend I was hanging out with, so I say none since I didn't hang out with anyone. He then continues to go on a rant about how I never listen to his word and my step-mom joins in saying we're such bad kids (me and my bio-brothers) and so on. After that he asks if he should send me away, and I said if he wants to he can. He yelled and banged the table as soon as the words left my mouth. He grounds me even further saying I back talked him, and didn't listen to him. He says that he apparently told me I have to ask him first, but I don't recall this?

Now I have had talks with him about how I feel about yelling. I'm scared of loud noises and I feel genuine fear every time I hear loud noise. I told him about this and told him I am scared of him. He said that it's good that I'm scared of him. What should I do? I feel trapped and like no one listens to me? Am I just overreacting?

He only thinks that he has been there for me all my life and makes my mother feel horrible that she left him when I was 2 years old.  It was 29 years ago, you are both married move on with it.  You want me to let go and say oh yes shes a horrible person for wanting us to have a good life when she knew you both wouldn't be good together, NO I'm sorry that is not happening.  She made an amazing choice 29 years ago.  I grew up in a happy home and would not change that for anything.  And another thing, you could never pay your child support when you were suppose to but yet now you can take in another child??  I do not agree with this one bit.  I could have taken you for the 29 years you were suppose to pay for when I turned 19 BUT i couldnt do that to my sister even though she now hates me because lord knows what you and your wife put in her head.  All i wanted was a relationship with her.  But when I asked her to do something for the wedding it was nooooooo cant have you actually help and make theses plans easier by having you come try on dresses or get measured.  But when they needed you picked up it was all fine and dandy.

1jte7d7,I think my dad is a narcissist and an alcoholic and I don’t know what to do.,AirportOwn4707,"I(F 18) have an older sister(F 22), mom(F 52), and dad(51). Last semester my mom started getting worried that my dad was drinking too much. I didn’t pay it too much mind because he alway drank at parties and I was used to it but after my mom mentioned it to me and my sister I started noticing him going in the garage randomly during the day for 30 seconds and coming back, or sleeping in the middle of the day when he got a full night of sleep. 

Recently, with the government funding cuts, my dad lost his job and that’s only hurt his mental health. Now arguing with my dad is impossible because it doesn’t matter what the argument is about, he’ll pull out anything to try and win, even if he’s in the wrong. This is very evident considering I’ve listened to my parents fight almost every night for years. This is reason one I think he’s a narcissist. Reason two is that he’ll only do thing for me if it is convenient to him. Last year I was having a movie night at my boyfriend’s house and his parents wanted me out by 9. I ran it by my dad earlier in the day and he confirmed that he could pick me up at 9. When I called him at 8:30 to ask if he was on his way, he spontaneously went to a restaurant with my mom and friends and told me to figure it out. I got pissed (i’m kinda hardheaded) and told him he promised me a ride and that I wouldn’t have even come if he said no. I called my mom and she said she would come get me. Turns out she made him leave to get me, and he spent the entire ride calling me and hanging up on me saying shit like this: “this isn’t fair”, “you can’t do this to me”, “your boyfriend is going to leave you”, and “you didn’t even finish your SAT training”.

Now my sister found alcohol bottles in the garage that’s she’s been monitoring. She’s been taking pictures and sending them to me so we can see how he is definitely day drinking. And this isn’t just a beer or two, it’s vodka or hard liquor. Full bottles have been disappearing and being replaced in the span of 3-4 days.

Today he told my mom that he found me undressed in front of the computer the night before. This is a complete lie because the night before I was baking at 12-2 and my mom came down to ask me what I was doing and saw me messing with the oven. Not only that but he had the computer the day before so I don’t even know where it is. This devolved into an argument where I was screaming at him asking why he was lying about something like this. He tried to spin it on my grades and I told him that I’d show him my grades if he apologized for lying. He couldn’t do that, he said “I’m sorry” and I said “for what?” and he said “for trusting you” so I called him on his bullshit. Then he walked away saying “I’m sorry I lost my job” which confused me because what does that have to do with accusing me of nudes? My sister thinks it’s because of the drinking problem.

So to my question, how do we confront him about the drinking without triggering his narcissistic personality?",1,0,1744004916.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jte7d7/i_think_my_dad_is_a_narcissist_and_an_alcoholic/

I'm trying my best to listen but I have my own troubles. I've been recently diagnosed with IBS plus I'm trying to handle my mental health. Sometimes it feels like my parent wants me to be angry and afraid as well.

1jtb3rb,"I don't like my mom's boyfriend, but she insists I ""appreciate"" him.",Sad_Profit_6982,"I'M SORRY THIS IS SO LONG. When I (17F) was around 9, my dad passed away. About a year and a half later, my mom started seeing someone new—Adam, a widower with no kids. At first, he was introduced to me and my older brother, Grant (who’s two years older), as just a “friend.” I didn’t even know they were dating until I asked my mom directly. Even though she had asked us hypothetically how we’d feel about her dating again—and we supported her—it still felt confusing and a little embarrassing when I realized what was actually going on. For a while, I denied it when people asked if they were together. It felt like they were keeping me in the dark on purpose.

Over time, they stayed together. In middle school, I went through a phase of not really liking Adam, but he did make an effort to bond with me, and I appreciated the attention, especially since I’d often felt neglected after my dad died. My mom was always busy, one brother was off at high school, and Grant mostly stayed in his room. Adam filled a bit of that gap, at least early on.

But as I got older, I grew more distant. He started showing up less, sometimes disappearing for months. I didn't care much, but it definitely made him someone who wasn't a constant in my life. I didn't notice when he did or did not show up. My mom would vent to me about how he upset her, and I started seeing him as kind of selfish and hard to connect with. He’s on the spectrum and has mental health challenges, and while I try to be understanding, it's hard to forget the times he hurt my mom—stood her up, berated her on the phone, or made her cry. I remember one specific instance where my siblings and I were hanging out for the 4th of July, and she had plans to see a show with him that night. He stood her up an hour before, and she ended up going to the show alone after we tried to convince her to stay home with us because she didn't want to waste the money, which made me so mad. 

Even though I don’t like him, I do respect that he’s there for my mom emotionally. She has really long talks with him on the phone about anything and everything, and he's a good support. But that’s where it ends for me. My mom and I are really close, but Adam is the one topic we fight about. She wants me to be kinder to him, like getting him a Christmas present just because he shows up to my events. But I never asked him to, and I honestly don’t care if he’s there or not. He comes more for her than for me, and I’m okay with that.

She gets oddly defensive about him—once I joked about stealing his Tupperware and she got mad, even though she’d laugh if it were anyone else. It’s hard to talk to my brothers about it. My oldest was already out of the house by the time Adam came around, and Grant actually likes him. I don’t buy him gifts, which has become a bit of a sore spot, but to me, that just reflects how I feel: I respect his role in my mom’s life, but he’s not really a part of mine.

My most recent issue has come with my grad party in a few months. I have a poster board full of my dad and I left over from his funeral that I want to put up, and my mom bought a new one for new pictures too. However, she told me that she wants it to be used for the people who've ""supported me"". I know she means Adam. I got upset, because she's tried to push him onto me so many times before. When she pushed the Christmas present (multiple times, may I add), I stopped talking to her for a few days because I was so mad. She said that it was a little unfair that I had a poster board dedicated to one person and won't make room for others on the other one. I don't know how to explain to her that I don't care enough about him to put him on. I don't like him. How can I tell her in a way she'll understand? :(",1,0,1743993637.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jtb3rb/i_dont_like_my_moms_boyfriend_but_she_insists_i/
1jtb2o8,Family rant,Sea-Confusion-3700,"I am the youngest of 3 sisters and these past couple of years I’ve struggle a whole lot with one of my sisters (the middle one, shocking)

She’s 5 yrs older than me, has a degree but no job or intention to get one, whatsoever. She still lives at my mom’s house and on top of not working she doesn’t help around the house AT ALL. She doesn’t even wash her own dishes, less talk about taking the trash out, etc.

She wakes up at 1 pm every single day, it’s like she’s on summer school vacations, the problem is: she’s turning 41 next year. On top of all she tends on having relationships with man-childs with no future (such as her, I guess) where they rarely go out, because apparently they don’t like to spend money, and they spent all day at my mom’s house, just watching tv and eating crap, and my mom ends up not only cleaning after her but also after her dumbass boyfriend.

This is the reason why I can’t get along with her the way I used to, I’m so frustrated because she doesn’t want to grow up, she never takes accountability for anything and has a victim mentality and my mom keeps enabiling her so I also get frustrated with her because every time we get into a fight, my mom ends up taking her side and I end up being the bitch just for speaking up. I know I should just give up and mind my own business but I see my mom getting more tired each day and it’s heartbreaking, she’s so scared of my sister that she rathers to put up with her shit.

Both my older sister and I are sick and tired of this situation but sadly, as long as my mom doesn’t put her foot down I guess there’s not much we can do.

I just wanted to know if there’s someone reading this who’s going through the same thing.",1,0,1743993538.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jtb2o8/family_rant/
1jt9e6v,My brother might get kicked out if we don't find a way to help him get his shit together.,Commercial-Dig-981,"Warning: This is a lot longer than I orginally had intended, So I apologize in advance. Thank you! 

So I (20F) have 3 younger siblings, but the second oldest (15M) is the one we have been having trouble with but before we dig in, let me give some context. 

So my parents have fought for as long as I can remember, like it was so bad that 14 year old me would have to physically get in between them for them to separate. They would yell, curse, throw, and knock things out of anger which terrified my two youngest siblings. But as my brother and I got older, we got so used to it that we didn't even flich whenever they would say ""I want a divorce"" because we knew they would make up like 3 days to a week later. It's been that way since I was potty trained, it seemed like my mom and step-father hated each other but at the same time ""loved"" each other. Now looking back it was just toxic all the way around. But I digress, about 4 months ago, after 15 years of marriage, I guess my dad just couldn't stand us anymore. Behind all of our backs he decided to pay for a home, packed his things and a week after Thanksgiving just dipped without even saying goodbye. Since he's been gone we've just been finding out more and more stuff he lied or hid from all of us, I'm thankful that my mom was able to at least get a job before all of this went down. After he left he cut my siblings insurance, he lied for months about keeping up with the bills, when he hadn't paid any of them including the bill for his OWN DAMN CAR, he opened several credit cards, one of them was put in my mother's name with her knowing, and he maxed them all over so we're talking at least 15,000 (probably more) in debt and Because my mom is so behind and is making minimum wage we are literally in the process of practically losing our home. And this whole damn time, the asshole had checked up on any of us kids not once, hes too busy having fun with with friends or whatever. So as you can imagine is been very hard here, but let me finally get to the point of this post.

My brother, who we will call Smith, has been going through a lot these past couple of months. My step-father used to pick on him and call him weak/pathetic so he already had really low confidence. Well a few months ago he started looking at ""adult inappropriate context"" using his school issued laptop to do so. Now my mother is a very devote, God loving woman (That was another reason why they split up because they were going in different directions) And after she had a really, really bad phase with my step-father that had to do with corn, she absolutely HATES anything that has to do with that kind of stuff and I can understand where she's coming from. However, in a lot of ways my brother resembles his father from his looks to his mannerisms sometimes. Anyway my mom ended up catching him in the act, the first thing she did was beat the crap out of him, but after she calmed down They had a seemingly heart to heart talk and he said he wouldn't do it anymore. He started behaving better, so we thought that would be the end of it. That is until the past couple of weeks

Smith has been having a lot of issues With his ""friends"" who also look at that kind of stuff. He's been failing most of his classes, has lied to us about it, and mom discovered again that he snuck into her bedroom to look at stuff again. And the final straw was yesterday, when he and my youngest brother got in a argument, and instead of walking away like a normal teenager, he shoved him and one my youngest brothers prized possessions ended up getting broke. My mom snapped at him and told him ""You either need to get your shit together or get the f**k out and go stay with him, because I can't deal with this."" I can understand where she's coming from. I really want to be sympathetic towards him but I feel like every time I try to defend him, he does something stupid.

As for the whole corn thing I don't really know how to handle this situation. As a young female I don't have nor do I understand that urge, I don't think my mom really does either. Part of me believes that she thinks that if he just ignores it, it'll go away. I'm pretty sure it's deeper than that, but at the same time it's just hard to understand. Since my mom is working everyday  and I'm also working and in college part-time, we really don't have the time to practically babysit him on everything he does. 

So I am looking for advice from guys, but Women can also be included in this as well, on how do not only talk to him, but also break it down to my mother who might get angry. ",1,0,1743987969.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jt9e6v/my_brother_might_get_kicked_out_if_we_dont_find_a/
1jt8vog,Conflicted on if I'm the A-hole or not,NatureBig6941,"**16M - Got kicked out by my parents over allergies, CPS got involved, now I feel hopeless**

So on March 31st, my mom (34F, pregnant) said I wasn’t going to school because my younger brother was sick. She made me go with her to the doctor for him, whatever, normal day. We get home around 10am, I’m unloading the dishwasher like usual.

I have really bad allergies, and pollen’s been insane lately. I rub my nose, and she just snaps, starts yelling about how I’m spreading germs (??). I try explaining I *do* take allergy meds and they don’t help, but she mocks me, screams, throws a tantrum.

She calls my dad, who’s on a work trip, and he tells me:  
**“Go pack your bag. Don’t come back until I’m home in 10 days.”**  
They’ve said that stuff before, but this time I actually left.

I went to a friend’s house, his parents were chill, but his mom tried calling mine and got blocked. She called my dad, and suddenly *he acts like he doesn’t know what’s going on*. Then she called CPS.

Later, my mom texts saying I’m “welcome back” *if I apologize*. Then threatens to call the cops. CPS and the police get involved, and the cops take me back home. My parents lock me out, lie to the officer, say they never kicked me out, and claim I’m violent. Cop clearly didn’t buy that part.

After that, things just got worse. I took an old phone to text my school pastor (he knows how they are), and they flipped out, said I “stole” it. My dad says he talked to a lawyer and I’ll be kicked out of the family, sent to juvie, and not allowed at school anymore. School is the only place that keeps me sane.

CPS shows up, parents lie again, say I refuse to get tested for depression/ADHD (it’s actually them who refuse). CPS sees my stuff (which I’m not even allowed to use) and basically shrugs it off.

Now my dad won’t talk to me at all. Mom’s super emotional, but if I watch my words, she doesn’t lose it. I’m still allowed at school, but I can’t go anywhere or do anything outside of it. I’m barely allowed to eat.

I've tried getting a job, both for the money and to be away from home more, however my parent's don't want me hanging out with my (other) friend anymore (because they know how close we are and that he was going to help me out if my parent's didn't let me back), so they aren't letting me apply to his work, and they don't want to pick me up later than 8, so no one is hiring me due to extremely limited availability on my part. Parent's blame me not getting a job on me fully, when multiple places literally bluntly stated it was because of low availability on my part. 

Which leads to the other issue, I had only one friend who I was able to hang out with after school (as everyone else is always busy/their parent's don't let them hang out), is now gone, as my parent's saw multiple text's and email's I had sent after they kicked me out, requesting help.

I feel completely unwanted. I’ve been seriously thinking about ending it all. Just walking downstairs and grabbing a knife, and stabbing myself.

My brother recently broke up with his gf after 9 years and an 8yr old together so he’s moved back home as well and is sleeping in the loft and my niece stays with us every other week.
I can’t stand him, he has no manners, leaves the toilet seat up, gets really drunk on the weekends and pisses all over the seat, makes an ungodly amount of noise in the house. Eats my food or uses it to make lunches for my niece. He enables my mum’s drinking problem, calls me ‘diseased’ because I have Type 1 diabetes & rheumatoid arthritis, calls me lazy because I work from home and when I have achy/painful days from the arthritis and can’t move a lot.
It was Mother’s Day in the UK last week and completely ignored it despite being in all day, he takes advantage of my mum financially and would rather enable her drinking (which is a whole separate issue) than actually deal with a problem instead of running away.  
He’s just such an unpleasant person to be around, my bf is black and we’re white and he makes racist and ignorant statements while he’s in earshot, he walks around like he thinks he’s a gangster but when you say anything to him about his behaviour he doesn’t even say anything because he’s a coward and is afraid of confrontation.

Something pisses me off and I wanted to rant and ask you if this is normal or I'm just overreacting. I don't eat big meals, so what I usually do is eat half and leave the rest in the fridge to I can eat it tomorrow at lunch or late at dinner... and every f\*\*\*ing time, it gets eaten. Main suspects are my father, who by the way, shouldn't be eating that kind of salt food in his age, but he does eat a lot and ignores medical advices from everyone in the family, or my brother, the same one back from abroad, who eats a lot too. 

I let it pass the first two times with the mentality of 'we are all here for a few days, I won't escalate this, I'll just buy something else'... but as it happened for more than once and became repetitive, I'm loosing my cool... first time it was my brother, but this time he got two bites of half a sandwich in my room that I just heated and brought in my room and my dad came to me like 'Please never mind him, you know him, he will go back in a few days' ... and right after two days, it happened again, and god knows who was it this time. 

I was extremely mad and told my mother ( she has nothing to do with this, but she is the only one I can talk to ) that I will never bring food for me again and just eat in the spot or just stay hungry. 

Just how tough is it to see some food in the fridge and either ask whose is it, or when you eat it, you buy something later ? It's just inappropriate ! And I have been buying food for all of them on my expenses and didn't even care about it.. because I thought we are all having fun and enjoying vacations.. but I do think this is just mad annoying and inconsiderate.

1jt16ow,"TW: Asian family trauma, emotional abuse. My mother is turning into someone she wasn’t and is hurting me in the process",veryniceespresso,"I had a difficult childhood with my family, abusive father. My mum did her best to provide for us and did what she thought was necessary. A lot of my mums anger was put on me as a child, because I was emotional and difficult to handle. I would always hear “you’re like your father” and was always punished in ways that still hurt me today.

My mum was also hurt by her mum as a child and she told me she would always ask her why but her mother who was being abusive towards her, always said “I don’t remember”

Now today, I tried to speak with my mum because our relationship was grown so much but as soon as I brought up the topic of the hurt that I felt was wrong for a child to face, she lost it. She said she doesn’t remember it, but remembers that I ruined all her birthdays and said that I’m not manipulate, but I talk just like “someone who was very manipulative in the past”…. AKA the father.

My family has this habit of throwing everything under the rug and never resolving our issues. This pattern is constantly breaking me and I know I can’t expect her to be the person the give me closure, but along with this, she’s becoming more hateful towards the world and complaining about everyone around her. She needs one up everyone and she’s becoming racist as well. She was never like this when she was younger, but now she’s growing into the same patterns as my grandmother.

I want to talk to her and tell her, because everyone around her sees it and I’m the one taking the hits from it. It’s just heartbreaking.

1jswjk7,How do you deal with your parents who don’t respect your wishes when it comes to your children?,Letsjustlisten,"For a little background, my family is religious. I myself am as well. However you might call me extreme or extra depending on who you are. 
I do not believe that we should be practicing pagan holidays. For example Christmas (Saturnalia/ Yule), Easter (The celebration of the fertility goddess Eostre), Halloween (Samhain), etc. All of these holidays were “Christianized” by the Catholic Church when Rome made Catholicism the nations religion. I personally believe we have been indoctrinated for centuries to celebrate these pagan traditions. 
In the modern age, people don’t even bat an eye. Their parents did it, so they continue on doing it. Nobody ever questions why we celebrate them. Well after I read the entire bible, I didn’t see any of these holidays mentioned. I began to question why we celebrate them. After digging for almost a year, I decided for myself and my family that we will no longer indulge in these ancient rituals. With reason I believe the Catholic Church whether intentional or unintentional, created a golden calf out of these holidays. Neither God nor Jesus instructed them to do this.
Now when I told my parents they were pissed. Saying “what so you won’t be coming for Christmas, or this or that?” Or saying that my kids will miss out on all the fun. But then I jokingly said to them “oh so if everyone jumped off a bridge are you going to join them?” Because that was always an answer I received when I wanted to do something everyone else was doing. 
I believe we are children of God in Babylon so why should we follow the rituals and practices of the Babylonians? We are supposed to be set apart from everyone else. However fast forward to 3 years later my parents almost sneakily do things with my daughter. Like Easter egg hunts, Christmas presents, etc. it really irritates me that my parents have basically said “screw that we are still doing it with your kids.” It’s disrespect and complete lack of understanding as to why. I want to set a different example for my children. One where we worship God and not worship materials and self, which is what many of these holidays have turned into. Just a consumeristic material money grab. It’s not about God, it’s not about Jesus, and I don’t want this perversion in my home. I don’t want to keep my kids away from my family but honestly if they can’t respect my boundaries I will be forced to. Does anyone have any advice? 
If you tell me to lighten up with the holidays I will ignore your reply. Thank you in advance.

Ps. I’m not saying I don’t celebrate holidays, I just only celebrate the ones that God ordained. For example instead of celebrating Easter this year, my family will be celebrating Jesus’s death and resurrection during Passover. Because biblically that is the period of which it happened. You can read the 4 gospels and see that Jesus is the Passover lamb of God. The last supper was on the “feast of unleavened bread”.",1,8,1743952886.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jswjk7/how_do_you_deal_with_your_parents_who_dont/
1jsus8i,Need help,Unusual-Coat-3765,"**How do I deal with this situation?**

I know my family loves me, but sometimes it feels like they don’t really like me. I’m turning 25 this year, and I have a bachelor’s degree in Industrial Tech. Unfortunately, finding a job in my city is difficult, and right now, I only have inconsistent part-time jobs. I work as a reliever service crew member at a small store and as a data annotator. Before I got these gigs, I was unemployed for a year, during which I took on all the household chores and essentially became the house help. Unfortunately, I still haven’t been paid for my work.

I could find a better-paying job if I moved to another city, but I can’t because I’m the extra person at home. My family would need to hire a maid to replace me, which we can’t afford, even if I found a better job.

If I decide to take a higher paying job, I’d need to relocate because the 6+ hour total daily commute is unmanageable. But if I leave, my family would need to find someone to take over my responsibilities, and I worry they would become overworked without me. I’m the youngest in the family, aside from my 11-year-old niece.

Every day, I end up shouldering the brunt of my family’s frustrations, especially since their work drains their mental health. We’re not destitute, we own our house but we live paycheck to paycheck. There are occasional special moments, but nothing extravagant.

I’m a chatty person and can talk your ears off if I connect with someone. But I’m also introverted with a small circle of friends. I sing (maybe off key), and if I don’t talk or sing, the noise in my head becomes overwhelming. Unfortunately, my mom doesn’t like the “noise,” which makes me feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her.

I tend to ask a lot of questions, even if they seem trivial, because if I don’t, no one talks to me. It feels like I’m in the house but not truly at home. I end up blurting things out without knowing why.

Now, I’m at a crossroads. A friend suggested I need to leave to grow, adapt, and truly live my own life. But I’m torn. Leaving would mean my family would have to take on more responsibility, and I’m not sure if I’m ready for that step and if I decided to just leave.

1jssn16,Should I distance a very close friend,Illustrious-Gas-289,"Not exactly a family issue, but one can consider it to be something along the lines. So long story short, one of my closest friends got engaged to this girl within the same uni. For some very real and valid shite, the girl hates me. The series of events unwrapping was rather surprising, but now they're engaged and prolly will get married.

Recently, they posted a story together and I found out I have been blocked by her and she did make a fuss once (I've heard from other friends) when my friend wanted to hangout with me (with others ofc).

It's like a thief discussing honour, but I want to do the right thing and salvage whatever is left of my honour. Should i slowly, very subtly start to distance myself from my friend? Perhaps this is my karma, letting go of a very good friend before I'm asked to for sum dumb (but real) shite from way back?

1jsndvr,I’m so close to a mental breakdown.,NoBanana7767,"Okay, I’ll try not to make this long but it may get up there. I have some family problems going on. Me (23F) am living with my mom, step dad and little brother (12) along with my boyfriend (31M) and my kid. We have been living with them for a few months, to get back on our feet. And it’s been a struggle because of money being tight and the price of homes and apartments nowadays is high. The problem is my brother, I know most will say it’s an age difference between us and that’s why we fight but that’s not the issue at all. I believe he has a lot of things going on that’s wrong with him mentally. And the fact my mother is so lenient with him. He gets away with everything he does without any harsh punishments. He doesn’t learn. He treats me and my daughter horribly. He constantly teases her, yells at her, tells her that no one loves her and so many other things. My boyfriend told me to talk to my mom, and I have. She does NOTHING. She’s talked to him a handful of times and he never learns. He makes snide remarks to me saying “oh that’s why you failed high school” and I flunked out of high school but I got my GED. And for that I’m proud of myself. BUT, I’ve told my mother the things he’s done time and time again. And her only response is “sorry, I’ve tried talking to him, he won’t listen to me.” Excuse me?! She is the adult here, you can’t just accept that your child doesn’t listen to you. No you have to put your foot down and set boundaries but he’s learned he can just walk all over her. And she lets him. Tonight, I was talking with my older brother about the whole situation and we both agreed that he’s unruly and she’s too soft on him. He overheard me talking and ran to mommy, like usual and twisted things. She messaged my brother and then later on my step dad confronted me. Told me flat out “are you and someone talking about your brother?” I told him yes because I have every right to talk about how I feel and how I’m being treated horribly. And he told me “well you need to stop” like? Huh? So I can’t talk to my older brother about how I feel and how I’m being treated? That’s not right… my feelings are being completely invalidated. I’ve tried so hard to overlook it all and get along with my brother but he has such a horrible temper and if something doesn’t go his way he blows up. And then he comes back and apologizes for what he did and says he’ll be better every time. But he doesn’t change and acts the same way the next day. My mom nor my step dad do anything about him and the way he treats me and my daughter. My boyfriend told me once we could move to another state where his folks are at, on the other side of the US. And we could start fresh. I’m seriously debating on doing it. I just.. can’t take being treated like this anymore. By my own family. If me or my siblings ever did anything remotely close to what he did when we were young, we’d get slapped silly for it. I get it, he’s the baby but that doesn’t excuse his behavior and the way he treats others. He gets super angry, takes it out on others around him then blames them or something else and apologizes. And guess what? He does it again. Because he knows he can get away with it. I need advice.. I don’t know what to do.

1jsm591,My mom ruined my birthday gift,UngaBungaFratbo1,"I am up unable to sleep because this is still bothering me so I thought I would comment to get other people’s opinions. I’m a college student and I have a sister whom I’m rooming with. We never really got to celebrate birthdays and holidays growing up because my mom always found it to be not a priority. She decided it wasn’t important so, many years, I would go without any gifts, no cake, sometimes not even an acknowledgment that it was my birthday. I’ve never had a party or get together with friends. We stopped formally celebrating my birthday as soon as I got into middle school. 

My sister and I decided to start celebrating our birthdays in college because I have found that gifts mean so much to me in adulthood and I love giving people gifts more than anything because it’s something I didn’t get growing up. My sister told me she bought me my birthday gift and went home for the weekend to my mom’s house. while she was out of the house it must have arrived and my mom picked up the package, opened it (which is obviously a nono) and then texted ME even though the package had my sisters name on it and asked me if it was my package. The conversation went as follows:
Mom: a package came is it yours 
Me: who’s name is on it 
Mom: your sisters 
Me: then it’s my sisters 
Mom: *proceeds to explain what was exactly in the package instead of asking my sister about it 
And that’s how I found out what my gift was. 
She completely spoiled it. And I am just upset. I never get to have anything special for my birthday. I just wanted to feel special for once. I know technically it hasn’t “ruined” my birthday. Many people in my life are basically telling me “yeah that sucks but it didn’t ruin the gift” 
But I just feel like it represents so much more to me. Holidays have become so important to me in adulthood and I try so hard to make other peoples days so special. I feel like it’s an always the painter, never the subject type of situation. 

My mom didn’t mean to spoil it and she has apologized (half heartedly). I know her intention wasn’t to ruin my gift but somehow I’m still so angry with her in my heart and I’m just so mad about the situation probably disproportionately compared to how other people may be able to brush it off. I went cried when I found out that she spoiled the surprise and I’ve been crying off and on throughout the day. I am still happy about the gift and I’m excited for my sister to give it to me but simultaneously I feel so sad. Idk I guess I’m just looking for peoples opinions, how would you feel in this situation? ",1,3,1743914249.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jsm591/my_mom_ruined_my_birthday_gift/

Advice needed

Long time reader, first time poster 💖
Please forgive me, there is a lot. 

I (40ishF) and my ex husband (40ishM) and his current wife (40F) have a 15 year old daughter “W.”  Our custody arrangement is that I have “Sole Custody” and primary custody, while he has visitation every other weekend, 2 weeks blocks for summer, and rotating holidays. 
Here is where I need advice. 

My daughter loves her Dad, “O” and his wife “B.” 
O and B also have younger kids.

W is scared of hurting their feelings or of them looking at her differently for any reason.

O and B are very religious, and participation is in no way voluntary. (Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against church) We are talking get to church an hour before service, staying both services plus Sunday School in between, staying and being the last ones to leave. Then being back 30 min - 1 hour before evening service and again being among the last to leave. Total of 6-8 hours on Sundays. (Along with several evenings during the week at the church and nightly Bible study at their house during the summer and any long breaks) Now, at this church, they talk about how we are all supposed to love and care for each other. But in the next breath, they are talking about how anyone (for instance) who identifies as any part of the LGBTQ+ community needs to be made of their sins and how evil they are. 
W is part of that community, and has been for a while. W absolutely canNOT tell O and B. They will tell their church, it will spread and she will be called out for it. It might not be in full church service but I promise you there would be multiple meetings and prayer meetings to lay hands on her and cast the evil out.

My daughter and I have a good relationship and she knows she can tell me anything. I have known this about her for some time, and have fully supported her. 
Her younger siblings, do not listen well and obey well either. O and B mostly just laugh it off if in public. 
There is little privacy at their house. Even at 15, she gets guilt trips about not spending enough time with the family, when much of that time is spent yelling at siblings. 

If she asks to swap a weekend, she is put on a huge guilt trip. 

My daughter and I have had many at length conversations. We have talked about how she could respond respectfully but not let them guilt her. It is easier said than done. 

They make comments to her about she needs to find her own voice and speak up for herself. But if she even tries to speak up, she is told she is just repeating what I say (even if I hold a completely different opinion to what W is saying.)

Now the problem, as much as I would like to call them out, all it would do is make them make the weekends more miserable than they already are.

While I know what they are saying, the only way I could say something is to reveal that W has told me. There is a slight chance the court would take W’s opinion into account, but it would require her being willing to tell the court that, and O knowing. Even if visits were reduced, they would lay so much guilt on my daughter for it that it would crush her. 

Is there any way I might be able to help her?",2,0,1743909113.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jskqmp/how_can_i_help_my_teen/

Keep in mind I really despise him and only tolerated him because he was dating my sister. I never liked him from the start. I explained to her why I wanted to stop being his friend and reminded her the out of line things he did to me and she understood why. Ever since she started dating him she’s been distant with me and we never hangout and barely talk anymore. It got worse after we had the argument. She constantly stays texting him and hanging out with him and she doesn’t give a shit about me. Even though I told her it really upsets me that she never hangs out with me anymore, she acknowledged that but she hasn’t changed.

1jsfn2s,Just need to vent!!,y3rbua,"My siblings and I were close when we were growing up. My mother had to go to greener pasture to support us. There’s 4 of us. I am the oldest (32), second is 29, third is 27 and youngest is 25. Except for the third, we all have family and kids now. My mom had a long time partner that we do not like but for the sake of my mother we all try to be civil. As the oldest, everyone came to me for their problems and I helped as much as I can. I get it I was my siblings pretend mom for ten years before we all were reunited and even when my mom is physical there they just choose to come to me. There is no hard feelings on this my mom understands.  My husband and I bought a house so I separated from them but we were still tightly closed. The second one got married and was divorced (I went to war with him. He cannot depend on my younger siblings and that’s fine) but in things like this my third and youngest siblings are what I describe as “draggers” instead of actually helping they just make negative noises. Moving on, I bought a second house and rented the first house and at this time the third wanted to go to school and hands were tied so we all helped for third to become a nurse. My mom covered mostly all of third’s finances because student loan was not enough and could only do weekend jobs. And when we go out we cover for third no problem. One day My mom and his partner fought and it was to the point that they separated (third and fourth was living with them) they wanted a place to live so I offered my first house because none of them had a good credit or is able to afford it at that time so I sold the house to my mom under our names still. A month later my mom went back to her partner and the third was livid about it. Third didn’t her to go back and I said she’s an adult, that man makes her happy that was just a part of relationship problems. This third sibling had never had a relationship. Like never been kissed so I understand where third’s coming from and I explained that relationship are complicated it is a common thing. My youngest sibling impregnated a girl so he moved away but not really (her partners family dynamics is a mess. We had helped them so much financially. The mom has cancer surviving day by day and dad is lets just say not all there) which is fine we understand now mostly it was mom,me and second that helped them financially. Now the third one is finally a nurse. What a relief. Moving on, my mom and her partner wanted to get married this is where everything went wild. For better understanding this third sibling is still living at the first house I sold my mom so she is living there rent free, only has to pay bills. One day third just messaged me and attacked me saying why did I allow my mom to get married! Third sibling and my mom was close. They were bestfriend and all of a sudden they just fell apart I asked my mom and she said third sibling doesn’t like my partner. Back to the getting married part, mom went ahead and eloped, she was happy. That’s all I care. But my third sibling fell ice cold. The night third messaged me third was just going at me like it was all my doing they got married! I asked my mom if she told the third sibling anything and she said how can I when third sibling doesn’t even talk to me. I had no energy to argue that night and just basically told third to f*** off. Why are you telling me all this when you can directly message our mom? I do not want to be there messenger. And now 8 months later we have not at all talked to each other it’s basically me, my mom and the second that talks to each other. My second sibling has said that both the two siblings has just took advantage of us and that they only comes to us when they need help. This makes me sad and angry. My kids are asking why aren’t they seeing third and fourth sibling. I just tell them that they are busy and working.

1js7omx,Mom and stepdad still not trusting me with anything at 20 years old,GandalfTheHoe,"So basically this came up because my stepdad has like a cottage type place that I asked if I could throw my 21st at (there's several rooms, a pool, and a lake)(I'd invite like 10 people and we'd just chill). And I live in Europe so I've been drinking since 18, so there's no risk that I'd get totally first time wasted and go crazy, and break stuff- so what I'm saying is I can handle my alcohol, that wouldn't be an issue. The problem is when I asked about it they kind of try to dodge my question and then they say we can discuss having it at the cottage if they're also at the party??? Yeah let me just have a 21st birthday party with a bunch of 20 year olds and then my mom, stepdad, and a baby in the other room... If I sound like an annoyed brat it is because I'm annoyed. Not really a brat though.

My stepdad showed up in our lives about 5 years ago when I was 15 and we've never really gotten along, which is fine. Not great, but it's ok. But the problem is that neither my stepdad or my mom have ever trusted me with anything. 2-10 years ago that made total sense, but I think I've grown a lot?? But I've never been allowed to invite like more than 2 friends to our house, from 12-19 (I live alone now), I couldn't host an 18th bday party at our house, I wasn't really allowed places either in middle/high school (I always had to ask my dad to talk to my mom about anything, and it was usually completely dumb), which combined with not being allowed to have friends at my family's house really made getting friends very difficult... At 18 I went to another city with a friend to hang out and we were going to sleep in a car, my mom forbade me from going because we were going to sleep outside, I get the worry but still, I'm a legal adult. There are more stories but I'm not gonna tell all of them over here. 

Other things I haven't been trusted with over the years and some still: candles, going anywhere after 6 pm, a sleepover at 14 etc

My stepdad is pretty much the same-ish, just with less authority over me. Me and my sister weren't allowed to go get things from his garage alone, for what reason? I don't know, there wasn't anything secret there, they just thought I was going to break the garage door or something. And I can't ever help him with machinery or anything and so on, but you can tell he doesn't trust me with stuff either. Genuinely going crazy over here. Can anyone relate? He's also difficult to communicate with because he has issues with social cues and he tends to either look into things too much or too little, gets easily offended and angry. My mom's more emotional and irrational.

I messaged my mom about my feelings and in response she told me I really hurt her feelings and that I shouldn't send messages like the one I sent. So basically my feelings hurt my mom's feelings. And then she got my stepdad to send me another message saying my message wasn't adult of me etc. I didn't swear or namecall or flat out criticize her. That's another thing they do, they bring in a third person if two of us are arguing or disagree on something. To like one up me or something. Mom usually runs to him if we argue. Idk.

i’m 23F and ive dealt with this shit ever since i was a teenager. my brain has almost completely blocked it out but when i do remember i don’t know i just feel numb. it feels fake. like i’m describing a movie or tv show i watched. either way it’s one of the scariest situations ive been in.

if anyone relates to this or has gone through similar situations please reply down below. i feel so alone in this 

last year we went through something incredibly traumatic due to my brother.
he robbed a delivery boy who worked for a gang and they then went after my brother. a man called me posing as a worried man who just happened to encounter a boy who got robbed. idk how the fuck he got my phone number, whenever i asked that he kept saying that doesn’t matter. he talked to us in my native language, which made us trust him cause you know, he was “one of our people”. through this phone call he found out where my brother was hiding and had my dad drive out to go get him..
me and my mom waited and waited until my dad called us and said we need to get the fuck out right now. it was around 22 PM, i had to call the taxi to drive us to my grandmas place.
i remember ducking by every window in case we get shot at.

when we went to my grandmas place, she was confused as hell and when we explained what’s going on she started crying. my dad then called and said that they had guns pulled on both him and my brother and demanded 35K plus interest. they said we had 30 min to give them the money, in cash.
this gang was some sort of connect of the serbian mafia. don’t know what they’re called even if i did i wouldn’t say it.
i’ll never forget how i was mentally preparing for my brother and dad to get killed. i was fucking terrified of losing them… 
they ended up giving us more time by changing the deadline to midnight. both my grandma and my dad took out money to pay these motherfuckers.

once my dad went to deliver the money to the gang they gave him a location on where to drop it off. they then loaded his car full of drugs, pills and the money in cash. my dad was terrified of being pulled over, luckily that didn’t happen.
thankfully they didn’t do anything else after that. they threatened us, we delivered, earned their respect and they never fucked with us again.

my brother currently lives under protected identity and doesn’t live in this city. something else happened right after this, he got threatened by this gang he wanted out on. he wanted to get out of the life. they kidnapped him, drove him to some woods, had him get on his knees and put an unloaded gun to his head to scare him. my brother came home to collect his passport and ID. the guy was waiting for him outside and both me and my mom saw him. he said “don’t worry you’ll get him back soon” i could tell he had a gun in his pocket. 
when he came home he called social services to put him under protected identity. till this day he still won’t say anything about the gang. their names, nothing. snitches get stitches as they say.. 
we’ve had the gang members knock on our door a couple of times last year to see if my brother is home. they were clearly looking for him, we didn’t open the door though. thankfully though we haven’t seen any of them since. hopefully they’ve forgotten about him..

anyway i’m currently safe just wanted to get it off my chest and see if maybe there are people who relate to this bullshit.. ",2,0,1743864146.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1js4zem/my_life_sometimes_feels_like_a_movie_or_tv_show/

He's been married to my mom for around 25 years now, and I'm concerned for my mom. I also don't want to tell my mom or confront my dad because of the things that may come after. We also arent in the best financial situation, with him bringing the most money in providing for the family.

1js3wvs,My teenage daughter doesn’t want to spend time with her grandpa (advice needed),Princess_Bride_lover,"Father-in-law 60M wanting to spend time with our kids 19M and under

History: My father in law ‘60M’, only really comes around to spend time with my wife ‘40F’ (his daughter) and/or our kids ‘19M’, ‘18M’, and teenage daughter on Christmas and their birthdays (he wants to take each kid to lunch or dinner). Unfortunately he has had a serious criminal charge that he is serving probation for, from the last five years or so. My kids are aware of the criminal component as we didn’t hide it from them once the dust settled on the criminal charges. He’s been maritally separated for the last several years also. 
My wife and I have done a lot of soul searching on how we interact with him and our kids. 
He shows favoritism towards his own kids and also one of our kids. My wife realizes that a lot of the interactions she’s had and the way he treats others shows a strong narcissistic personality. 

The situation and question: Our teenage daughter is being asked to meet with him for lunch for her upcoming bday and she has no interest in accommodating him as she’s indicated he’s made little to no effort to get to know her. 
We have not communicated these internal struggles she or we are dealing with as it pertains to when and how we interact with him. 

What are some suggestions in how we 1) talk with him and let him know that we are only going to put the same amount of effort into the relationship as he does? 2) let him know his granddaughter doesn’t want to spend time with him, even just for a short meal?

1jrycj1,I can't be my moms caretaker anymore,Free_Pop_8416,"
Hi all! My Fiancée (F26) and I (M27) live with my mom (F62) and we want the government to deal with her and take care of her. We live in British Columbia, Canada. 
My mom is dependent on me, but I'm not officially her caretaker. She's physically and mentally unable to live on her own, but she needs someone who helps her with every day living and my fiancée and I are unable to do that. She receives PWD and CPP every month and is unable to work, so she cannot be financially independent either. 
We can't have her in our house anymore and need to have her put somewhere, but I don't know what options there are. Preferably where it won't cost my fiancée and I extra money like a retirement home. She isn't needing to be fully hospitalized, but I believe she is more ill than she lets on and needs to be looked after by some kind of live in nurse or health practitioner. I am also just tired of the constant emotional abuse she causes me.

1jru5yo,Why do my parents think I make bad life decisions?,Zestyclose_Show8653,"I beg to differ and I actually think she should be the last person to judge the way I live my life when I’m doing the best I can. 

For example, my mom never finished school. She dropped out of an English bachelors program and has never tried to complete her degree. She also doesn’t know how to drive either. Right now, I am 27 and trying my best to finish school while working. I am not staying home on my moms couch all day long, however she seems to think going outside is the worst thing in the world and that I’m making bad decisions for working at a restaurant, drinking alcohol and networking. 

To add onto this, they do not like that I drink alcohol. I do not believe my consumption is over the top. At one point I would have a glass of wine at the end of the week to relax, however in my current situation I have been drinking few times a week, but still nothing too crazy. I’ve remained focused on getting school done (my dream career is something very specific and I need to get into a really good grad school for it) having a real career so that I won’t be forever stuck living an empty life and working a dead end job. 

More recently, my dad has spent all of his money on gambling, sex, clothes, jewelry, and a brand new car. The home we lived in is no longer and we are going to end up in the shelter if we don’t do anything and for some reason my mom refuses to work past 20hrs/week despite still being young and able bodied. I started working at a sports bar a year ago for more pay (I’m in a highly populated city) to save money for myself. For my mom, this was a “bad decision”. She feels like waitressing and bartending is a dangerous job because I work closing shifts. She has even told me to quit my job even though it was the only job I had at the time. She wanted me to try working at the post office instead. When I explained to her no one responded to my application and that I’ve been rejected and ghosted she seemed to think it’s my fault. She also thinks it’s a bad decision for me to strive for a graduate school outside of the city we live in even though all of my dream schools are out of state and they’re all objectively better both financially and reputation wise than the options near by. I also just really want a change of pace, I’m almost 30, I want to travel and experience something else before I decide to have children and I also do not want to raise my children in the city I grew up in. But for some reason….these are all life ruining choices in my mom’s eyes. ",2,2,1743823134.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jru5yo/why_do_my_parents_think_i_make_bad_life_decisions/

I only saw him then because I went to his home (I don’t have a vehicle & had borrowed one that day). He’s married & has 3 kids-18m(away at college),14f & 12m, latter are homeschooled. He’s self-employed with 3 businesses, 2 of which are out of state. Very involved in their church.  I only hear from him when he needs something which isn’t often. He never calls to just see how I am. Ever. Neither does my DIL. I usually get a text on Valentines & Mother’s Day’s. He’s not one to show affection. No ‘love you’. Never. I went through cancer & nearly died. Only saw him because they thought I was dying & my sister called him to come to the ER.  He never called me to see how I was. Ever. I recovered.  About a year ago I got quite sick. I texted him to let him know I was in the hospital. ‘Bummer’ was his reply. That was it.  Anyway. I’ve asked him if I’ve done anything wrong & he says no.  I’m at a loss.  I used to be active on Facebook & tried to like/love posts about the kids or business (that they used to have locally).  My granddaughter does ballet & I went to the Christmas show the last 2 years to see her. ( the earlier one I went to my son & family were there too)(I had known when they were going so I intentionally got a ticket for the same show).  I did live with them for a couple years at their invitation.  There’s a great photo of him & DIL on their Facebook (I went onto facebook a couple days ago) & I’d like to get a print of it & frame it to display it.  On the other hand, looking at it makes me sad cause I never see him.  I only text him on rare occasions & when I do he’s always got notifications turned off. Phone calls go straight to voicemail. Though I also rarely call him. 
I have a 30y/o daughter who works out of state. Hawaii & Alaska out of state. She also worked in China for 15 months.  She jokingly calls herself the ‘favorite child’.  She knows how I feel about her brother.

Live at home with my mom and brother who is a few years older. For the last year or so my brother has been commenting on my parenting. And whenever he does so he throws in an insult or smart comment. Don't get me wrong, I know he loves my kid and they're best friends. But he says that I'm not a mother and that I don't know how to be a parent and his main thing is I don't do anything.....just because I don't help around the house. I work full time.

I give him baths, brush his teeth, throw out his overnight diapers when the pail gets full,, fix him food, go grocery shopping, take him to and from daycare, am always home when he's home, take him to the doctor, etc. But because I don't help ""around the house"" he says I'm not a mother. Him and my mom have never asked me to do anything so it's not like they've asked a favor and I've said no, it's more he wants me to be like hey mom do you want me to do this for you. Also neither of them work while again I work full time. Yes my mom does my dishes and laundry and my brother uses that but you can't say im not a mother and I do NOTHING. And here's the kicker.....she washes his clothes and dishes too....but he thinks its different because again he doesnt work so he has like 2 outfits in the wash at a time. But.....she washes his clothes and dishes too so I don't get how he can use that against me. I also pay hundreds of dollars in rent a month. He can say I don't do laundry or dishes, that's fine.

1jr52zb,It breaks my heart to see my cousins like this.,Major-Release-339,"For context, I was super close to my cousins. I recently came to a realisation that they are secretly jealous of me. How ? I will explain. 

The lady cousins give me a side eye look whenever I am getting or putting makeup ready around them. 

They never took a stand when our common friend or any other family member said mean things to me (I do that for them always, I take their stand) 

Now my cousin is in the USA for studies, he keeps showing off that he earns in dollars, and he always shows off when I am around. 

And here’s a background about me, my parents are the first generation educated in our family. Naturally my parents being more educated, they can afford better things for me. So this aspect is there, but they do for my cousins too. But ofc, I am the daughter so I will get the daughter treatment, not them. 

My parents willingly collateral one of our homes against a loan for my cousins USA education. They don’t see that, but they still want to be mean ? 

Also, it’s just that other relatives ask my little nieces and nephews to learn English from me as I am fluent, my cousins have issues with that too, my dad used to get them tons of English books and English tv channels which they didn’t use. I did. How is it my fault ? 

And I workout and eat healthy. I do focus on my appearance and I am the fittest in my family. Other cousins are either too heavy or not too good looking as they just don’t take care of themselves in terms of workout and diet, I do that. 

Idk why this jealousy is there and it makes me so sad. I wish I had an equation with them. 

I take care of myself coz I like to that’s it. I feel so sad and frustrated. ",1,0,1743747072.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jr52zb/it_breaks_my_heart_to_see_my_cousins_like_this/
1jr38ig,Father Daughter Estrangement,Scared-Ad328,"Hello guys, 
So I have been estranged from my father for about 8 years going on 9. I am 25 years old. I bumped into him recently at the VA hospital. For Background story.. He was never the best father when he was there physically. During my childhood I remember him being distant, emotionally absent, always yelling, and militant (children should be seen not heard type of old head), and short tempered. Consistently talked shit about my mother even though he cheated on her multiple times and had children outside of their marriage ( He has multiple baby mothers and children). Let me add that my mother is not perfect but she did the best she could with what she had. My father Believed I was the dumbest of all his children and showed it (My siblings have successful businesses and some even have doctorates). As a child I would forgive him multiple times but got a point where I just couldn't keep breaking my boundaries. When I was 14 shortly before a holiday, he told me to not call him again. About 2 years later in 2016/17, we got in contact again after my favorite aunts funeral, so he could sign my papers so I could go to the military after highschool. At this point my mother was fully financially taking care of me , and when I asked him for $200-400 dollars for my senior prom he said he would help me but at the last minute said he couldn't help me. I felt betrayed yet again and decided to leave and never talk to him again. Let me be clear,I wasn't upset because he told me no, I was upset because my mother had raised me for all those years without any financial help and he couldn't help lighten her load even for one important time in my life ( I had a job at 15 and was also helping with bills). Over the years I have come to terms with the fact that I won't be able to ever truly trust or respect my father. Per our run in at the hospital , he expressed his feelings about our strained relationship but I don't think I believe him. I don't if I was in shock but I just didn't feel anything. I've been through more than the average person in life, which I won't put on the internet, but I still feel the urge to forgive him and I'm not understanding why. I am with diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder and PTSD. I really need advice because I genuinely don't know what to do or how to feel because I don't know if my urge is because of my diagnosis. He has always preached accountability but in the past continually blamed my mother and me for his actions in stepping out of my life. I also found out in 2022 that he was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy with narcissistic tendencies via digging through documents in storage.

1jr2hl9,"My father changed after marrying my stepmother, and it's tearing me apart.",Fair_Dog_1223,"Hi Reddit,
I'm writing this with a heavy heart. I never thought I'd be sharing something this personal, but I can't carry it all inside anymore.

My father remarried in 2022, and since then, everything has changed — especially him.

My stepmother constantly manipulates him, filling his mind with negativity. He used to be someone I could at least talk to, but now… he drinks almost every night and lashes out at me. I get verbally abused for no reason — horrible things no daughter should ever hear from her own father.

Yes, he still pays my fees. But over the past year, he’s started acting like even our existence irritates him. One day while drunk, he told me, ""I’ll give you 20 lakhs, just get married and get out of my life.""
It broke me. As if I’m just a burden. Just because I’m a girl?

He says things like ""Why don’t you just die?"" or accuses me of ruining his life. I’ve done nothing except try to survive in a house that no longer feels like home.

The worst part? When my younger sister was seriously ill with jaundice in February, he and my stepmother were secretly planning a mannat (a vow/prayer) for having a baby. We only found out because of a secret recording. In it, my father used a disgusting slang prostitute — and blamed my sick sister for not being able to perform their religious ritual.

How can a father say something like that?
How do I live in a house where I’m constantly insulted, blamed, and told I don’t matter?

I don’t even feel like I can talk to him anymore. He switches between pretending to care when she’s not around, and turning completely against us when she is. It’s destroying me emotionally. I still love him, but I don’t recognize him anymore.

I just needed to get this out. If anyone out there has been through something like this… how did you cope? How did you survive?

Thank you for listening.

1jr2dnx,does my mom have a reason?,Ordinary-Acadia-3824,"i’m a 16 year old girl, i live with my two parents, my mom 49 and my dad 56. 

my mom and i have had a super good relationship for the past year or so, our relationship before was very rocky, ive dealt with mental health and depression for most of my teenage years, mainly causing our rocky relationship due to my mom believing i was doing it all for attention. i put our relationship in the past. when i forgave her, i was around 14/15. but now, her same behavior is coming back.

my mom recently retired from her job, allowing herself to spend more time with me and tend to the house more. she retired around a year and half to two years ago, probably around the beginning of my freshman year. it was great, we were super close, spend a lot of time together, she took me and picked me up from school. i loved it. for once, it felt like i actually had a mommy who loved to do things with me. for a little context on our relationship before, my mom was an alcoholic, she would leave very often to go to bars late at night ever since i was around 8 to about 13 years old. until the second cps case came up, that’s when she stopped. she still drinks almost every day, but it doesn’t get as bad or noticeable anymore. 

for even more context, in the sixth grade is when i first experienced true mental health issues, problems with suicidal ideation and severe depression. my first attempt being on a saturday, after an intense argument with my mom. i tried to take several ibuprofen, but i reached out for help, and was soon escorted to the local children’s hospital. this is what started it for my mom. all from that night i can remember is “look what you’ve done” or “are you happy now?” , it’s safe to say it was very traumatizing. after my psychiatric hospital stay, it was still rocky. i was like , 12/13 years old on all types of medication. i was angry. resentful. sad. tired. and i just wanted my mommy to love me, and wondered why she didn’t love me like other mommies loved their daughters.

overtime our relationship did develop, sometimes we got into intense screaming arguments, but the doctor said that the anger i had was side affects of my medicine. so sooner or later, i stop taking it. withdrawals on top of withdrawals. our relationship got worse, then better, constantly relapsing into the same cycle of argument after argument. this continued until the 8th grade.

around the end of my 8th grade year is when my mom retired, leaving her a stay at home mom, and full time housekeeper. seemed ideal for her, but it would soon end up as what she calls, “the worst thing she’s ever done.” my mom and i bonded a lot during my freshman year, spent almost every day together. i loved it so much! she helped me through everything. even when i was trying out for an athletic training program at my school, or when i joined HOSA, she was there, and always helped me.

but now, sophomore year, i feel like it’s all repeating. all we do is argue, every day, it’s like she hates me. she constantly tells me she’s gonna walk out that door and never look back, and leave me here with my father, who’s barely around, and barely talks to me. i just don’t know what to do. i know i don’t treat my mom ideally, nobody ever truly does, every time i snap its by accident, due to sophomore slump. but everytime i apologize, there’s no getting through to her.

everytime my mom looks at me, she has a certain gaze. one that’s full of anger, and one that almost looks like resentment. does my mom have a reason to hate me? does she know something about me that i don’t even know? i can feel all my problems creeping up on me, slowly taking over my life again. and i just want out of this cycle. i want my mom back.

1jqy9zf,Parenting Dynamics,Helpful-Warthog-3412,"I come from an unusual upbringing. There was a large age gap between my parents which lended itself to drastically different parenting styles. One was very old fashioned and believed in traditional gender roles. The other was slightly more open minded but followed suits with the spouse. 

As I got older, I felt like an outsider. Let me be clear, my parents weren’t abusive. I had what I needed and participated in extracurriculars. Despite all of that, I never felt I had emotional support. I rarely recall hearing “I love you” from one parent and neither seemed proud of my accomplishments.

I promised myself I would break the cycle, if I ever decided to have a child. Flash forward multiple years, and I find myself happily married to a wonderful person with a child. The child is now an adult and everyone gets along well. 

Today, we had a conversation about a fictional creature and described it in great detail…anatomy, defensive mechanism, you name it. My child’s friend joined the conversation over the phone and seemed suprised by our embrace of the ridiculousness. This is not the first time I noticed this trend.

We preaching honesty and open communication. My child knows the importance of trust and feels free to be himself/herself. We embrace the child’s interests, activities, and friends. The child is involved in family decisions, from what should we do for meal planning to what areas we should move to. 

Since my upbringing was the exact opposite, I am not sure if this is normal. Is this a normal dynamic?",5,2,1743724802.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jqy9zf/parenting_dynamics/
1jqm2ff,Am I helping my kids? Or hurting them?,Responsible-Start307,"My dilemma. Am I helping my kids or damaging them?

My(45F) mom (66F) let me know yesterday that she feels like she is walking on egg shells around my kids(11F, 10M, 9F, and 5F. The 10M is on the autistic spectrum though high functioning, and the 5F has ADHD.).

For background my mom engaged in several different types of abusive behaviors while I was growing up. She did not know, and was encouraged not to, stand up to my dad so she took her anger and frustration out on us kids. Being the oldest I have the most memories of this time period. When I was about 15 years-old both my parents began getting therapy and studying parenting courses and things improved significantly.

About a year ago, while watching my children my mom took them to the supermarket, ended up forgetting the bananas at the checkout station, realized it after she and the kids were already out in the van, and requested my oldest (then 10F) to go into the store by herself and retrieve the bananas. 

At that time my daughter told my mom she didn't want to go into the store by herself. She asked if one of her younger siblings could go with her. My mom insisted she go in by herself. My oldest daughter did as my mom asked, but was very upset by being asked to go into a very large, very busy, store by herself. 

Once I had the kids back at home my daughter asked to no longer go to Grandma's house. 

I found out what happened from both my daughter and my mom and asked my mom to please not have my kids go by themselves into the store by themselves especially if they are saying they do not want to.

My oldest stayed cautious around Grandma, but eventually seemed ok until some new infraction occurred. This time my oldest refused to tell either Grandma or me what Grandma had done that she did not like. I asked my mom what happened and she had no clue. 

(While my daughter might just be a horrible communicator which is why my mom was unaware she had done anything that caused a problem, it is also true that, having allowed herself to be a doormat to others, my mom occassionally walks over other people the way she allows herself to be walked over. But, this does not happen often now as far as I know.)

Though I asked my oldest what had happened several times over the next 2 months the only information I got was that it had something to do with Grandma. Eventually my oldest confessed she couldn't remember what had happened that made her so upset. Not certain if there was a legitimate concern or my daughter was just emotionally immature and not handling conflict well I did not pursue the subject.

My oldest has continued to be withdrawn from Grandma and now brings her tablet and hides away from others for most of our visit at Grandma's. 

My oldest does get angry at me often. Though most of the time I agree with her I was in the wrong. Only twice has my oldest stayed angry at me for more than a night. (I have anger management problems that I am working on, but the progress is slow as it is tied into my childhood trauma.)

Yesterday while again watching my 4 children (My mom watches them about 6 - 8 times a year) my son brought some of his Legos to her house, which is not allowed because in the past he has stolen her Legos pretending they belonged to him. My mom thought he again incorporated some of her Legos into his current creation and his creation got damaged. He freaked out insisted all of the Legos were his and began yelling, throwing some of the Legos, and leaving the room. 2 of my other children let my mom know that what she did was not ok.

I addressed my son yelling and throwing the Legos, by telling him that being upset was ok, and telling Grandma what she did that he did not like was ok, but yelling and throwing things was not ok. I also reminded him he is not allowed to bring his Legos to Grandma's house because he stole Legos from Grandma's in the past.

He grabbed his Legos and went out to the van to wait for the rest of us. While my 5 years-old continued to tell Grandma what she did was not ok.

My mom has been upset and uncomfortable about these three combined events. She let me know she feels like she is walking on egg shells and feels I do not back her up and support her rules with my kids. 

While she finds watching my kids uncomfortable she has no problem with my brother's 6 children and believes this is because my brother and SIL teach their children that Grandma's house has her own rules and they have to follow them. While I suspect I am siding with my kids.

(As a side note while my children struggle in school and 2 have an identified learning disability my brother's kids are all high achievers. So, I do suspect the problem is me.)

I realized after my conversation with my mom the conflict between her and m kids is so uncomfortable I have been reducing how often she watches them. I am getting ready to almost stop having her watch them altogether now finding out that my 2 oldest don't want to be there and Grandma is also uncomfortable.

But, am I really doing what is best for them? Or, am I socially disabling them?

1jqi8g3,Dealing with my mom’s drug use and mental health issues – seeking advice on how to help her and manage the impact on my life,Appropriate-Ad5799,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a difficult situation involving my mom, and I’m not sure how to approach it. Over the past few years, I’ve noticed significant changes in her behavior, and I’ve started to realize she’s been using drugs. I’ve always suspected she was taking sleeping pills, but recently things have gotten worse. She admitted to using cocaine, but I think there may be other drugs involved, possibly something worse like crack cocaine (based on what I’ve found at home). She claims that her drug use started after the death of her dog, but I suspect she has been using for much longer.

My sister and I confronted her when we found evidence of the drugs, and we even tried to intervene by having a family meeting to discuss her mental health. However, she’s very resistant to any help and insists that this is her life, and we shouldn’t interfere. She responds negatively to any attempts at helping her, often saying things like ""I'm the mom, I don't need your help"" or ""I don't care about your concerns.""

The situation is also affecting our work. We run a small business together, and while the company itself isn’t at risk, her lack of involvement is causing major communication problems. She often sleeps through work hours, and we have to take over tasks that should be hers, including responding to the boss and handling important work-related issues. It’s frustrating because she’s the one with access to the company’s bank account, but she’s neglecting those responsibilities, which leads to fines and other issues.

This dynamic is also creating tension among us as employees. She’s the highest earner but does the least work, and this causes frustration among the rest of us. The employees know what’s going on, and it’s affecting morale, especially when she snaps at us for doing her job when she’s too out of it to do it herself.

On top of all this, I feel incredibly powerless. I’ve been trying to help her, but she doesn’t seem to care about the consequences of her actions. It’s hard for me to see how much of her behavior may have influenced my childhood, and while I’m grateful for the material things I’ve gained because of her, it’s hard to process all of these mixed emotions.

I’ve been trying to get her to see a therapist or go to rehab, but she denies that she needs help. I’ve visited a psychologist myself to learn how to approach the situation, but my mom has refused any involvement. Recently, I tried talking to my dad about the situation, but he feels that I should just keep trying to help her through her depression.

I’m also dealing with my own feelings of frustration and guilt. I feel like I’m constantly trying to help, but I’m not seeing any progress. It’s emotionally draining, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel especially frustrated when I have to take her phone and respond to work messages because she’s too out of it to do it herself. Sometimes, I even have to make decisions for her about things like groceries, as she sleeps all day and isn’t available to tell me what she needs.

Has anyone here experienced something similar with a parent or family member dealing with drug use and mental health issues? How did you manage the situation? What steps did you take to get them to accept help, if at all? I’m looking for advice on how to approach my mom, handle my own emotions, and manage the impact of this on my work and personal life.

Thank you so much for your help.",2,1,1743686343.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jqi8g3/dealing_with_my_moms_drug_use_and_mental_health/

1jqg2pg,Insecure 6 year old niece,Unusual-Relief-4004,"I (30 F) have a niece who’s extremely insecure about her looks, she has the most beautiful her, yet her facial features are not considered conventionally beautiful. She looks exactly like her grandfather, and she’s chubby, she has exactly my body when I was a child. She’s naturally tanned, and I love her skin tone, it’s gives off bronze color. 
Anyways, few days ago, we had a family celebration occasion, and I did my best to look good, because I enjoy wearing the best clothing I have and putting a flawless makeup, I enjoy making myself look good and I enjoy the process and being creative about it. 
So I went there, and I was the only one wearing something colorful and because I am a makeup artist everyone was complementing my make up and my look, and I was the center of the attention.

She was there staring at me and I smiled at her. The next day, she came up to me and said “your face is more beautiful than my face, your hair is more beautiful than mine, and your skin tone is better than mine” I told her that this is not true, and that she has the most beautiful hair and the most cute dimples and cheeks and the her skin tone is something that everyone wants to achieve.

Unlike most kids, she’s the kind of child who’s extremely loud, with leadership traits, talkative, and as any other child loves being the center of the attention. She’s a bit possessive, and gets jealous easily. Like for example “you’re my aunt not anyone else’s aunt, you’re not my sisters aunt, and not my cousins aunt you’re only my aunt” which is cute, and I know that it’s normal for a child her age to act this way. She’s jealous of her mother and wants my brother’s (her father) attention all the time and would sit in between them or squeeze herself. It’s sometimes annoying for us because we want her brother or her cousins to get a chance to be listened to, or get the chance to be played with. But she would talk over them, push them to play instead.

I know that this is out of insecurity, I am not sure how to comfort her, and make her more confident and less jealous of her cousins or anyone else.. I am concerned about her comparison with me.. it broke my heart.. and I really want to protect her.

1jqavau,My sister is always in pain but doesn't listen to anyone. Advice?,Business-History-450,"My sister(25) was abused as a kid and Is diagnosed with BPD. She also drinks a lot and gets really violent.  She dates horrible men that treat her like crap. One of them was already married and wanted her to be his second wife, one of them stabbed her and was physically abusive and one of them financially used her while he was cheating on her repeatedly. While being with them she would always lie to us and go meet with them always late night. When we question anything she defends those guys and blows up on us. How we dont give her freedom and we make her life miserable.  And the lies are constant. Nothing out of her mouth is the truth. She tells a lie and if no one believes her she gets angry and starts arguing about the lie as if its the truth. her hang outs are late at night. She was also in a car accident where I'm pretty sure the driver of the car was drunk. Point is she recently just moved back after she lost her job and broke up with her last boyfriend.  She temporarily moved out for about 2 years and we didn't hear much but she'd call us when she was in trouble and we would help but now she is back and the patterns started again. I know she is a victim and her BPD makes her act out but dealing with her self damaging behavior is too much. Especially because she blows up like we are enemy until her relationships fail.

I don't even want to bring this up with them because it'll start another Cold War in my family. My mother is the perpetrator while my father stays silent and enables this toxic behavior. 

My parents earn around $45K a year (single-income), own a home (with a mortgage still being paid off), and live alone, so their living expenses are relatively low. However, my mother accepted $800 per month from one of my siblings for nearly a year and recently received $25K from another sibling to help pay off the mortgage. My siblings are incredibly generous, which makes it upsetting to see them being guilt-tripped and ultimately taken advantage of by my mother. However, since they're not openly complaining about it, I feel as though I can't bring it up with her either.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent on here and see if anyone else is in a similar situation. ",2,15,1743568514.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jpgf4p/my_parents_tell_me_to_pay_for_their_vacations/

Every time he disrespects me, it’s extreme—way past just playful sibling stuff. Most of the time, I ignore it, but it’s been going on for too long.

There was one time I had to put hands on him because he pushed things too far, but even then, I didn’t really go in on him. I didn’t throw punches—I mostly just stood there while he tried to wrestle me, and I pushed him off. You know how some dudes exaggerate . The thing is, he still hasn’t realized that you can’t talk to people with extreme disrespect and not expect them to react in a normal, human way. He’s the perfect example of the loudest in the room is the weakest. We’ve tried to talk about it, but sometimes ignorant people stay in denial and continue their antics . 

I’m at a point where I don’t even know how to handle this anymore. If I ignore him, it continues. If I check him, he acts like the victim. And with my other brother co-signing his nonsense, it just makes things worse.

1jp8nho,Questioning my sister’s parenting,Acceptable-Lynx-1102,"Seeking advice here.. if I’m the “crazy aunt” or if my sister is the crazy one??

My niece (17) met this guy not too long back, he is either 18 or 19. I’m very protective of my niece as I helped raise her through majority of her life. 
I google this guy and within the last year, he was arrested for a strangulation attempt against his own mother out of anger?!

It has also been said he was sent away as a minor due to raping girls who lived in his area. There are no documents on this, just by word of mouth. So not 100% valid information.

I have witnessed reckless driving by him in my niece’s car. Frightened he will take her life due to his careless driving. (On the phone, riding bumper to bumper, driving over 100 mph, swerving in and out of traffic)

Bottom line is my sister acts as tho it’s not a big deal. Her words were “as long as she’s happy, it’s okay”. Excuse me?! I am not currently a parent, but treat these kids as my own, and I would NEVER be okay with this. 

Also, he is now basically living in their home, there are 2 younger children present in the home as well. 
I have tried reaching out to my niece about this, and feel as tho she’s blindsided of what is going on. I feel as tho they are possibly in danger.

Any advice or any similar situations you have been through?

1joqajy,I want to share something that I did in Goa.,dev_slayer_007,"Hello,

I am 37 year old man from Mumbai India. Married to my wife 35 year old and having a daughter of 8 year old.

I cheated on my wife. Why? I don’t have any justification. I know what I did was wrong. But do I have choices?

I am from middle class family and an elder son of my parents. Things started pretty early in my life. I am more near to my grandparents rather than my parents and after my grandparents passed I can’t find that connection with parents anymore. 

Things adds up when I started with my job at 23 and bought my first flat at age of 25. First car at 26 With no time to enjoy the age. I had 0 friends, the only people in my life was from my office, colleagues become my friends and I tried to open up a little.

I found my love in office only, and we got married. Even though we belong to same caste and social background, things got worse for me. Daily quarrel between my mom and wife adds up to my mental state and many time I have gone through mental breakdown, crying at night when everyone sleeps is kind of started happening regularly.

I tried to converse this with wife but it’s not helping, it’s like taking sides, no one is ready to define what is right and what is wrong. Everyone thinks they are right. Making fool of myself.

I tried to end this situation by living separately, but it adds up more, since we got our daughter and things were not good with my wife’s job. I never wanted she to quit her job to make the life easy for daughter and home, I left it to her to decide. We ended up living together with parents to make the everything go easy for everyone.

It’s not that I never interacted with my parents about the state of my mind, but according to them it’s what everyone deals with so I am no different. They never understood whats happening inside me.

As days passed the communication between me and my wife started hitting the bottoms, She is more comfortable with managing the daughter and doing all chores at home and her job. And she seems happy about it, however we were awful in bed with no communication. She does care of me a lot, but she didn’t have solution of my problems.

I started wishing to run away from my daily life to achieve mental peace now. It’s not that I don’t love my family or wife or daughter, but I cannot stop loving myself to smile back at them.

For many days I keep on searching for Goa holidays. I used to plan for things to do, a bucket list but I never got chance to execute it. The bucket list was very simple if you ask for..

1. Spend entire day at beach.
2. Have conversations with foreigners.
3. Ride a bike with someone behind me.
4. Try a fish dish.
5. Visit a good nightclub.
6.  Taste alcohol.

As you see above, I have this missing from my entire life. Somehow I lost all these years of mine.

One fine day, I just booked it.

I did reservations of a 4 star hotel in north Goa. Before few days, I started searching for some sites to get a travel companion with me. After searching for few I found a girl who is 23 and accepted my request to become companion.

It was one of the hardest decision of my life, harder than earning money. Being married to go with an unknown girl and staying with her in same room for 5 days. I know I could have booked two rooms, but I am also a human being, I see opportunity in this, not all items are in bucket list.

I somehow convinced my family that I am visiting delhi for office work, but went to Goa for holiday.

As I reached hotel, I saw a young girl waiting for me in hotel lobby for check-in. To be frank, my body was shivering meeting her and shaking hands with her. We both checked-in and went to our room.

For initial 4-5 hrs, we just discussed about our life, why she do what she do. Whats her exit plan to get out of this lifestyle, to understand how she manages all this sort of things meeting with strangers etc. 
I also opened up, in fact I was able to open up more than with my wife, as there was no expectations from her. She was in listening mode. She never questioned me for anything I am doing. She told me that she has seen people going through worst conditions.

I clearly told her about my fear of someone finding us and recognising us in goa, but she was very clear that she will manage and usually no one cares what happens in goa. I really appreciate her clarity of dealing with things.

We went out and had a relaxed sunset with dinner. During night I made few things clear, I was not looking for sex. I wanted a person who understands me and be with me on my sides. In fact I asked for a cuddles while in bed. We both went to sleep without getting physical, but in my mind I have already cheated on my wife. That night I had a dream about how I meet with her and all our marriage rituals. It’s one of the hardest night to sleep on.

Next day, I told her about my bucket list and she agreed me to show some good places.

First one is to try fish, its always been one of my to do thing to try a fish, but I didn’t know what is what. And how to eat it. That day and next day we tried Surmai, Bangda, Bombay Duck, king fish etc with all the difference they have, she helped me to understand how to clean those fishes and what to eat and techniques, they mostly tasted to me similar to the coconut in a nutshell. I thanked her from my bottom of my heart that she took me to different places. 

A day after that I got all my bucket list checked, going to beaches and talking to foreigners, having beer, We meet two beautiful girls from Germany and South America at querim beach , they were on holidays. We had a very good chat, swim with drinks with them.

Next day, I was a bit nervous about last few days and things been very crazy for me. As an introvert person I couldn’t have imagined doing all these stuff alone. No way, I would have been shitting in my pants before approaching. And she dropped a bomb about a nightclub on Sunday at Hammerzz. 

I have never been to nightclub, not even any club in small cities. I know what to expect, but I was not ready to dance alone. She gave me confidence that I will enjoy it.

So we got ready, she chose a white cotton shirt with blue jeans with sneakers is the best choice for the party, she wore a beautiful skirt, she was looking very pretty. Its been 11 PM when we reach venue, and as we enter I unlocked one of the most crazy memory of my life. It was one of the most memorable things I did in my life. We started with beer and ended up with whiskey and with all sorts of snacks in between. I saw young girls coming alone for party, young boys looking for hitting on someone. Old looking guys with young girls (BTW, I don’t look 39 according to her, I am not bald, Infact I have dark hair and some salt pepper look) and old ladies hitting on young guys. It’s all sort of crazy stuff I ever imagined happened in that one night.

We returned to hotel around 4 am, not really that high, but feeling sleepy and having painful legs. It’s that night she kissed me on my lips, and we slept hugging each other.

And here I am sitting on bed next day morning and writing this confession. Two more days to go. I have already cheated on my wife by considering someone else in my bed. But I achieved my lost years from my life. I do regret what I did and why I did, but the regret is overshadowed by the achievement from my personal front.

I do realise that money can buy happiness, and infact all those years of hard-word I did to skip the fun, is in fact paying the charges for this tour. I saved some money for self love out of my earnings, that is what is sponsoring this trip.

I do have to face my wife and family with a poker face, Not sure how things will turn out for me in future. I really wanted to do things that I love from bottom of my heart, but life with responsibilities is not allowing me to proceed.

I just wish to not repeat this episode again, because if I do, then it will go beyond repair.

Finally, its true that “What Happens in Goa, Stays in Goa”, for me its forever.

1joo8bc,Family in law,julyj8,"Hi, I decided to come here and see what helps me think along the way but I’m putting my foot down. I’m trying to make this short but straight to the point. 

1. my 2 children’s father (who I’m not with) has been ordering ONLY his son’s food, wings. Did not even ask or get some for his daughter and at times, my son eats it alone without offering his sister or his little brother food. It happened more than once and it is to the point that in my house, I do not leave a child out when we are eating in front of them, it just isn’t right and I’m not asking for my son to split all his wings but as a brother who cares to offer one for his sis and little brother DOES NOT HURT. I know there’s mindset out there with “oh that’s not his blooded brother” “oh his dad didn’t buy it for them-“ I just don’t agree what their dad is doing especially he hardly sees them and never likes to see their step brother coming around in FaceTime. I could see it bothers my son when I told him about this but there was no way I would want him’ to grow up not being thoughtful or to have a mindset like his father and his other family. 

2. This is something I wish I had said no. Their dad’s mother had asked them for the summer, nothing from their dad. Last summer my kiddos went, it didn’t go well because their grandma has been hard on ny son by talking bad about us, and my family. I have stayed quiet for so long with her and I do want to put her in her place when it comes to my kids. All I know she does enable her son to get away with whatever he can and supports him. Such as communicating with me for him. 

So, what is a good advice to say to her? I want to let her know that I have dealt so much with her son and now she wants to see them but to let her know that she needs to leave our name out of her mouth especially how she was hard on my son last summer. I stayed quiet because I did not want them to come after my son or my daughter but I do not want that to happen again. I want to speak up especially how her son is never around to help his kiddos but to do the bare minimum.

Although I have been able to overcome it and feel that we’re all in a better place now, (I frequently visit my parents and enjoy their company) my youngest sibling (25F) has decided to go no contact with our parents. It has been really difficult for me to try to navigate the situation, I have not told our parents that she’s not speaking to them, but when they ask why she won’t answer their calls or texts I feel their hurt and confusion. I can’t say I entirely understand her reason to go NC but I still respect it and don’t push her. I and another sibling are going to visit her for a few days soon and I don’t know what to tell my parents as we speak almost daily. I know for this trip I can probably find some lie/excuse about where I’m going but I feel like this is getting harder and harder/ more awkward as time progresses.

1johjvt,Wondering how to navigate this situation,Unlucky-Number-7777,"Hey reddit! Throwaway account, I have a situation and I thought it out until my brain is mushy and I need an outside opinion. Soo...

I F30 have been raised by my grandma since I was a baby. Mom was present here and there, but she was busy rebuilding her life, and I had no place in it. I never knew my dad, they divorced when I was born. So since forever grandma was the only parental figure I had. She fought so I can have an education, and she really cares about me. The problem is that, besides my mom, she also has 4 more kids. And during my childhood there were always fights that she shouldn't raise me, because she is already poor, and my mom is free of any responsibilities. She never completely stood up for me, as she wanted to avoid a family war, but she shyly took my side from time to time in front of them. Nevertheless, she raised me to her best of her abilities and I am and will be forever grateful to have been loved by her. 

Now she is 84 yo, with a recent stroke and diabetes. She was alone since 30 years ago (when her husband left her), and she lived independently ever since I know her, in the countryside. Now that she needs help, because health wise she cannot live alone anymore, everyone runs away like rats. I live in another city and have offered to have her, but I am not very friendly with her kids and I will not stand to have them visit. And I know they will. Also, she needs care, I am still building my academic career (I didn't have enough money to do it in time), and I fear I will resent her if I put everything on hold to be her permanent caretaker. She will not leave her house, because she is attached to those walls also. 

I helped her with money and reparations/constructions, but I accumulated debt because of it, and not with the current landscape, my salary was cut in half and I am barely getting by. I talked to her kids to maybe settle some sort of amount to hire someone to help her, but every each one of them finds excuses as to why not (no money, no time, no etc.). I am afraid she will hurt herself badly, or another stroke is in the horizon, or she will not eat or forget medicine. I cannot concentrate to do my daily tasks and I am daily calling her. But it feels like not enough.

Also since I discussed with her kids, I am suddenly the black sheep of the family because how could I dared telling them to try to act like a decent human being towards the mother that raised all of them alone? 

I really don't know what to do. And now I cannot even talk to anyone. I feel lost, furious and useless. How do I even deal with this?

1jogjw8,Emotional Abuse or Dysfunctional family,,"I am planning to cut ties with my family. I don't think it is healthy for them or me. I think I have a lot of covert narcissists in my family but I am not sure. Most of my family members say condescending things and are emotionally distant. Most are also very materialistic and don't show a lot of empathy. My parents are probably nicer compared to their siblings but they are at times emotionally abusive. My Mom was always very critical of me, very controlling, and I felt like I had  to do everything right. Sometimes she was nice and sometimes very mean, very split personality. 

My Mom didn't like to leave the house much but when she did she would become verbally abusive. I remember my Mom having frequent meltdowns in stores and berating people and I would hide in the shopping cart afraid to speak or be noticed.

When I became a teen, I think I started to feel responsible for her meltdowns and was emotionally coaching often. She struggled with her weight and self esteem and I was always there offering emotional support. It was hard to get her to reciprocate though. I was bullied a lot. I had friends but I was autistic and other students didn't get me. Sometimes she offered comfort but sometimes she was very dismissive and would say things like ""I don't know what to tell you. I was a cheerleader and everyone liked me.""

 I came home from school crying a lot. I remember coming home after school and wanting to talk to my Mom and she would shush me because Oprah was on so I would go to my room and cry. I would spend a lot of time crying in my room and no one would come check on me. My Dad would also sometimes tell me to ""shut up"" if I cried. I was always told I was ""too sensitive"" but I think that I experienced a lot of emotional neglect. They also often tell me to go to therapy if I get mad at them but they will never go themselves.

This last year, my sister had a wedding overseas (where she lived) and my Mom couldn't attend (really she seems agoraphobic).  But she did offer to pay for my flight so I could go. But when my Mom saw the pictures of the wedding she got jealous and took her name off the Delta credit card so I would be stuck with the bill. She then included me on a group chat with her friends and sent a photo of my sister in our mother's altered wedding dress with a text that read ""Neither of my daughters could fit in my wedding dress!""

My Mom has also accused me of ""going on a date"" with my Dad if I ever went anywhere with my Dad. I once went with my Dad and my two children to a theme park and because it was far away and my Dad has health issues we decided to get a budget hotel room for the night. I slept in a bed with my kids, they were very young at that point and my Dad slept in the other bed. Afterward, my Mom said it was creepy and made comments suggesting incest. She also accuses my Dad of cheating on her all the time and he is nearly disabled so it is just ridiculous. 

Years ago, Mom also inherited a million dollars when her brother passed away. I am a single parent and my ex was abusive and took everything in the divorce. He also quit his job so I would have to pay him child support. I have sort of struggled with financially (and with my mental health due to past abuse) but have worked as a preschool teacher and supplemented with a lot of house cleaning jobs to make ends meet. I am on Medicaid but she is reluctant to give me anything. My Dad will just go to the bank and transfer money if my car breaks down or I am having trouble paying my bills but my Mom will never help. She says the money is to take care of my Dad, but she is also a shopping addict so she is finding other uses.

Recently, I find out that they are spending thousands of dollars on MLM scam products their neighbors daughter is selling. I got angry and their confronted their neighbor about targeting them and taking advantage of them on FB because they were publishing pictures of my parents saying ""another \_\_\_company family member!"" Both of my parents are avoiding medical treatments because they don't want to pay for them but are throwing away money at the grifters they live next to. Both of my parents have sent me long texts demanding I apologize to their neighbors. 

I have stayed in touch with them because I wanted my kids to have a relationship with their grandparents. But my parents never contact their grandkids and hardly do more for than send them a card for their birthdays. There are time my Mom is empathetic and my Dad is not emotionally distant but the conflict is still very difficult for me. I think that was the only reason I kept trying  was for my kids, but I don't see how they benefit at this point. I really don't feel they care about their grandkids even though they say they love them and guilt me when I tell them they don't act like it. 

Does this sound like emotional abuse? My sister says we are just dysfunctional but I don't think she gets targeted as much as me. It really feels messed up. There are times when they are nice but it is always like night and day with their moods and I can't stand the volatility of it anymore.

There’s also a lot of people involved so I’ll try to keep everything an organized as possible but it’ll probably get pretty chaotic lol.

I(18 f) have lived with my mom majority of my life with her having primary custody of me and my sister(16 f), I’ll refer to her at J. My mom and dad got divorced when I was about 5 and J was 2. A few years later my mom met the partner she’s been with for over ten years, I’ll refer to him as A. A was ok for the first few years, he overstepped a lot and tried to make J and I see him as our father even going as far as making us call him “dad”. But as I got older and my mom gave birth to my half siblings, T(11 f) and R(7 m) his favoritism was more obvious. A is a by the book narcissist, nothing is ever his fault, “everyone loves him”, having to also control every single aspect of our lives. J and I also had to live with constant mental and emotional abuse as well the older we got from both A and my mom. Long story short living there was an absolute nightmare.

I had two jobs throughout the summer and my mom was being less strict about who I was hanging out with and what I was doing. I did find out that my mom had been taking money out of my account without me knowing and when I asked her about she had said it was to help with “bills” so I just dropped the subject. I wouldn’t have minded giving her some money to help out but it was the fact that she’d been taking it without my knowledge. A wasn’t around as much cause he was going more traveling for his work, it was a blessing to have a break from his constant judgement lol. That was until the weekend of my eighteenth birthday. My birthday was on a Sunday and my dad was planning on picking J and I up that evening (I wasn’t allowed to drive “my” car to my dad’s because A payed for it). I had spent the day with my best friend K, A was out of town so my mom said we’d just celebrate my birthday when he got back. 

My sister, T, had a volleyball camp the next day that my mom had asked me to take her too, she had a meeting at work that she couldn’t miss and I agreed.  I had just been there planning on driving the car I’d been using at my dads to drive to my moms house around the time my mom usually left for work. But apparently my mom had gotten all upset because she’d expected me to be there earlier to help get the kids ready to go, something she did by herself most mornings because I’d leave for work before the rest of the family even woke up. My mom blew up, texting me about how I was just an ungrateful brat who only ever cared about myself. Keep in mind I’m basically the oldest of a whole herd of kids from both mom side so I was constantly forced to be a third parent for my siblings. Anyways that morning my mom told be to just drop both mine and J’s phones in the mailbox at her house and said “When it’s convenient for me y’all can get the rest of your clothes and stuff”. Spoiler, it’s been over six months since the incident and J and I still haven’t gotten our stuff. 

So just to recap everything, mom made me take J and i’s phones to her house, J had to work and I still had to go to work that day I’d just planned on going in later. I had texted my dad about the situation since he was also at work and transferred all the money from the account that my mom had access to into a new account. I also emailed myself screenshots of the conversation and deleted almost everything off of the phone I gave back to my mom. I went to work, barely holding myself together, at the end of the day I talked to my boss and asked for the next day off to try and get everything sorted out and thankfully he was understanding and gave me the day I asked for. That night when my dad came home he was absolutely pissed at my mom, he made sure both J and I knew we could stay with him as long as we needed. He also took me to get a new phone the next day and added my line onto his account, he added another line and gave J his old phone. I texted my mom’s parents from my new phone and told them a less detailed version of what happened and they were also pissed. My grandma went off on my mom and A, her and my grandpa had stopped by my moms house to try and talk to them about it but from what I heard it turned into a screaming match between my mom and grandma. 

Since the initial incident my dad was able to get primary custody of J that way my mom wouldn’t be able to try and force her back to their house. K has been super supportive, she also went through something similar with her dad but that’s not my story to tell. Everyone on both sides of my family has been super supportive of J and I, other than A’s family because I’m sure mom and A told them some bullshit story and not what actually happened. I’ve been trying to take lunch to T and R at school but last time I talked to T she said that she had gotten in trouble for talking to me so I haven’t taken them lunch in a while because I don’t want her to get in trouble. I also found out a lot of stuff about my mom that has changed my view on her and I don’t think I could ever see her the same way I used to. 

So, back to present day, it’s been almost exactly 8 months since my mom kicked J and I out and we still haven’t been able to get our stuff. J recently turned 16 and got her drivers license and has been talking about trying to get ahold of our mom since we’re pretty sure she block my new number. I told J not to text mom from her new number cause when I did that mom gave my number to A and he started constantly calling and texting me until I blocked him. I just don’t know what to do at this point because I have a lot of keepsakes and books and such that I want from my moms house but my dad said he doesn’t want to fight my mom anymore. I already called the police department and they said there’s nothing they can do without a warrant or unless something physical happens. So I guess if anyone had advice that would be greatly appreciated.

It’s always been just her but I recently started up my own business and help her out alongside running my own
She’s been talking about death a lot recently as she’s got extremely bad health problems and she’s saying how she won’t be around much longer
She expects me to take over her business and to start thinking about what aspects of her business I want to keep up and running and what I would rather just drop
The thing is though, I don’t want her business
I find no joy in doing the work and has a hell of a lot of personalisation and SO MUCH customer communication
Obviously customer communication is part of any business, but I have severe anxiety and her business contains 75% customers communication
On top of that, as I said, I have my own business that I’m starting and I’ll need time to focus on that
But I don’t know what to do
What to tell her
How to go about telling her
I’ve always felt like I’m not good enough unless I do everything, unless I’m super smart and know everything, and I KNOW that if I tell her I don’t want her business, she’ll make me feel guilty for not taking it over
I know it’s her business and she’s spent so long building it up and so obviously she won’t want it to go to waste, but it’s just not my thing",1,0,1743446502.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1joamqd/business/

Dad should be. Anyways when I got out he finally
wanted to step up to the plate, which is cool and all
but im 21 already, but whatever it's cool. So I moved
in with him and his girlfriend when i got out. It didn't
take very long to see how bad things were and that
he didn't want me there cause he wanted to be dad,
I think he either wanted to bring me down with him
or try to help him, but you can't help someone who's
doing as bad as he was. He smoking spice doing
coke finishing 2 bottles a night and beating his girl. I
could only do so much in this situation.| can 1 help
my dad and not say shit but what kind of human
would that make me? Or I could go against my dad
and help his girl but then what kind of son would that
make me. So I did what any regular person would
do. I called the cops. They of course didn't do shit,
and I got shit for it. Anyways I was only there for
2 months until 1 night he got completely wasted
and accused me and his girl of sleeping together
and swung on me. It took about 2 seconds to have
him on the floor screaming for me to stop. I left
with my phone and wallet. It's been 2 months since

and shoes but has kept most of electronics which I
could care less about considering I have the brand
new samsung galaxy s24 that he gave me which is
worth a very pretty penny way more than any of my
things he has. But 1 live with my grandparents now
and most of those things were gifts from them, Its
been 2 months and he has constantly lied to me and
my family saying that he'll bring me my stuff and
doesn't. Im honestly getting super fed up because

today and told him later on in the week he's gonna
bring me my stuff and have his phone ready for
him too. And if he doesn't show up, i'Il show up to
his house with a squad car to witness the exchange.

1jo86il,Feeling of dread around family,Reasonable-Alps4821,"So I love my siblings, if I had to pick anyone in this world whose opinions I care about (excluding my husband) it’ll be my two older sisters and brother. I’m the youngest and always looked up to them obviously. We are all adults now and we did not have a great up bringing, always being separated because our mom was unstable and an addict, and our dads (all different dads) were not in the picture. So we all lead different lifestyles but also all have some of the same trauma. I did make some mistakes as a teenager that may have caused minor, temporary inconveniences in their lives like when I needed somewhere to live and would back out last second and move elsewhere, but I was a kid. And I did get married (courthouse and did not tell anyone) before any of them and my eldest sister did not like that at all. But as an adult, we just haven’t interacted much and things are weird. 

The biggest thing for me is that my sisters did not tell me when our mom died.. like they knew first and my sisters husband told my aunt who told me and my brother… my brother doesn’t care really but it still picks at me three years later. My sisters kept us in the know about her health until the day she died. A matter of fact the day is still foggy for me because it could have happened the night before I was told like I do not know.

I could mention it to them but I know deep down it’s only going to start something so for my own mental health I kind of just want to get over it.
My sisters still invite me to family events periodically but it’s always slightly awkward and I clam up and become almost non verbal. My husband has to be there with me because he is my confidence tbh. 

I know everyone will say to talk to them about it to hopefully clear the air but I am not ready. I’m non confrontational. It sucks and this is going to sounds terrible but I spiral and get very depressed when I have to be around them. It’s like trauma from childhood comes back and I feel dread and the wish to not have been born. I wish I could control those thoughts but they are overwhelming. I get such bad fomo and jealousy around my two sisters that I wish I could move far away and start life over.

I think I’m done ranting, I don’t really need advice, I just want to overcome the dark depression I get when I see them.",3,1,1743440593.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jo86il/feeling_of_dread_around_family/
1jo7wxv,"Childhood Thoughts of Trauma, what do others think?",Comfortable-Good5958,"I am a female, age 50.  I come from a religious/ Catholic two parent house.  When I was around 6 I think, I began self stimulating, masturbating.
Then When I was in around 2nd grade I must have one day found a Large chest at end of parent’s bed in their bedroom full of around 75 pornographic magazines, porn movies, porn playing cards.
I Don’t know when or how I began looking at it but and all I know is it became a hidden thing I did frequently and felt inclined to keep doing.  It got out of control when I began experimenting with a female friend. Eventually my horrible feelings and guilt got out of control and told parents by a letter.  I was in about 3rd grade or so at this time.  
In response my Parents came and told me “you’ll understand one day” and walked out of my room.  I kept looking at it.
My childhood and adolescence seemed to get worse after that.  In hind sight as an adult whose gone through a lot of counseling, I believe I may have disrupted my mom (especially) and dad’s self guilt and shame because they began treating me badly, but it was covert, hidden from my two sisters, and I believe now may have been calculated.  It was only directed at me, not my sisters. 
My parents Would read my journals and make me read it aloud to them, they would make me apologize to them for my feelings in my journal that they found personally hurtful, my mom would break my items in front of me, when I began binge eating in middle school they signed me up for weight watchers and told me I needed to lose weight, they would tell me I’m fake- not real in my words or emotions.  They Would ignore me, would ground me for weeks on end for disobeying with words, my mom would slap me when we were arguing.  Later in my late teens Both of my parents told me we were essentially “divorced” because I wasn’t being nice enough and sending enough hallmark cards and making them feel appreciated enough.  

Im trying to make sense of it all,  I now wonder and feel my mom (especially) has a lot of shame about something- a past wound our trauma.  Maybe she was sexually abused as a child, or has a hidden obsession with sex and porn.  
I think when I was 6 and told them about the pornography they had and brought it up, it made unmanageable amounts of shame in her and she proceeded to get me back over my childhood and adolescents, little by little.  

My dad has lived his married life trying  to make my mom’s feelings good, I grew up being told to be sensitive to mom, be careful and make sure mom’s happy.  Also he would tell me mom just knows better about everything.  She has senses that make her know better than him.

1jo4551,wish i wasnt born,Individual-Hat2334,"To start I am 20 nd live with my mother and her 16 yr old daughter. The place that we live has absolutely nothing and we have to travel constantly. Havent been able to find a job here for a while, no license and my mom made us cut off family so i am stuck. My (sister) who i hate calling my sister has been antagonizing me ever since she could speak. shes dropped out of school at 15 and has been home since, not trying to get her ged and with my mom not caring about it either. when we were little my ""sister"" would frequently hit me, (when my mother and grandmother werent) fight me, scream at me, and in one instance she pushed me into a glass mirror that then in turn shattered all in my back and i ended up getting in trouble for it. so ive learned that shes basically in the right no matter what and nobody ever listens to me. from ages 12-16 she somehow has gotten the craziest audacity, seemingly out of nowhere. Shes been sneaking out every night, one night the cops coming to my door and bringing her back and her only being in underwear and a tank top. at 4 in the morning. mom was at work and when i told her it she didnt seem to care. then she would frequently come home smelling like weed, and vape. i told my mom and she basically said she knew but again decided not to do anything about it. i tried to blow it off but there were times when i would tell her how terrible of a parent that made her and obviously you can tell how that went. i almost got kicked out and arrested several times for the ""disrespect"". even though my ""sister"" swears at everyone. lines like ""im gonna beat you the fk up!"" ""stupid bch"" then at some point my mom decides to have a conversation with me about her after my ""sisters"" court hearing. 
I ask her why she lets her act this way and she says ""she threatens to k!ll herself whenever i tell her anything."" i tell her that its her responsibility to put her in counseling or therapy and she says she will. nothing ever comes of this situation. She continues to act like this daily but its been getting so bad that she actually lays her hands on me and my mother proceeds to scream at me while it happens and tells me if i lay my hand on ""her kid""  im getting arrested snd that this is my fault and that she would do the same thing to me if it was her. so i obviously lock myself in my room with cuts and bruises all over myself while they both scream and bang on my door threatening me. I have anxiety disorder, have been diagnosed in 2nd grade. This sends me into a panic and i spend my night hyperventilating off and on, i eventually selfh4rm at times. to fast forward to now, im freshly 20 and ever since i was 16 my mom has been calling me an adult but refers to her 16 yr old who has slept around, done drugs, gotten tattoos and piercings, swears at adults and fights people, a ""baby"". the house we just moved into has doors that slam all night if the window is wide open due to the wind. i brought this up to my sister one night because it was loud and impossible to sleep. keep in mind she is the only person to do it and is known to antagonize people. she threatened to fight me over the fact that i asked her to do something about the slamming. so i eventually just tried to ignore the slamming. but tonight i couldnt sleep. the slamming was louder than ever. its about 7 in the morning so im thinking that everyone is asleep and sneak over to her room. i open her door and shes asleep. i figure shes asleep so she probably wont care as shes a heavy sleeper. i close both of her giant windows and walk back to my room. 5 minutes later it starts happening again. i walk back to her door and its slamming again. she hears me and starts cussing me out saying ""stop closing my sht before i beat ur ass"" i say respectfully, ""its loud and keeps slamming, i cant sleep"" and she gets even louder, which is even more rude because we live in a townhouse with one house on each side, so shes screaming loud enough for both sides to hear her. so i go whatever and walk back to my room. i lock it because i know her. here she comes barreling through the hallway screaming and shouting that shes going to beat my ass. she proceeds to bang my door so loudly that it wakes up my ""mother"". obviously the first thing that happens is my mom starts banging on my door telling me to come out. i open the door and they both start screaming at me. i tell my mom ""please listen"" and she goes ""no"" ""dont touch her shit"" i beg her to listen to me and she doesnt. i close my door and hear her talk softly to my sister while shes still screaming. ""are you okay? just calm down its alright"". she listens and they both go to my ""mothers"" room and both start to joke and laugh with each other. Im supposed to have orientation for a job tommorow but i cancel it because i know she wont take me. her anger lasts for weeks. so now im sitting here crying, contemplating my life, trying to keep my crying quiet because it only sends her into more of a rage because ""im an adult and adults dont cry"". i cant even breath out of my nose and my eyes are swollen and i just started my period but i cant leave my room so im stuck in fetal position in my bed. i dont know what to do. i have nobody. no friends, no family, no money, no job, no car. nd i forgot to mention but after the ordeal they purposely kicked my 2 cats out of the house. which the animal abuse could be its own thread. my ""family"" are terrible individuals. But i have so much kindness and fear and feel that saying anything to anyone about it will only put me in danger, and leave me in a even worse environment so i do nothing. this isnt even the tip pf the iceberg. anything bad that could happen to a person has happened to me and i feel hopeless.",0,1,1743430336.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jo4551/wish_i_wasnt_born/

1jo3ule,dad (and family) means well,Particular_Factor168,"I (F27) and my boyfriend (M28) are planning to move in together. He is military and just made sense for our relationship. I have an interview set up for a job in his city and everything has been progressing well and we are both excited for this change. My parents were supportive when I first told them. Recently, my dad has expressed concerns with us living together without a ring or engagement. I tried my best to assure him that it will happen but we are just doing things out of order, because that is just how it happened. How do I explain it to him without creating a rift? 
My family is moderately religious (grew up Catholic) but it was never something overbearing. It also came off as “we are concerned with what people will say” but I am a firm believer in that being their problem and not mine. The nature of my boyfriend’s job ensures that we would be engaged within 1-2 years but we will move in together within the next 3. I think having this added pressure that we should be engaged before moving in, is unfair and adds unnecessary stress when we both know and understand that marriage is the end goal, just on our own time. 
Any advice or way to keep this conversation from going haywire would be appreciated. I am not good with confrontation, especially with my parents (eldest daughter mentality) but I want to be able to hold my own in this conversation.

I tell him ""Can you stop being loud"" and my pleas go un-noticed. I ask my mother to tell him to stop, she doesn't care. 

Now the difference is when I want my light on late a night, because he also DOES this activity late at night too, he says some bullshit like ""Can you turn the light off I wanna sleep"" (He has no intentions of sleeping and just wants to stay up with the light off even tho its barely going to his side). I'll say ""No, im using it right now"" and he starts a hissy fit, calling me names and then calling our mother upstairs. He actively disrespects her and yet.. she still listens to him and only does this whenever his problem needs to be fufilled. its so fucking unfair and Im done.

1jnuu41,I don't know what to do with my relationship with my mom anymore,Amarilla-1998,"I 25f have a pretty toxic relationship with my mom now 50f. It wasn't always like this I would say it started in that past 6 to 7 years when I went to college. This started with doctors mistreating my epilepsy due to it being genetic and causing different symptoms and undiagnosed autism that came with it that she is was very unsupportive with when I realized something was wrong and asked for support. She has issues with me stimming and my other autism signs that she just says is me being different. She calls me a hypocrondric or that I'm looking for an excuse when I say I can't do things because I am disabled or that it makes me uncomfortable. She constant fat shames me, she used to comment on my hair being in its natural state which is very curly I have 4a hair we are both half black latino but stopped once I started getting it relaxed. Comments on my clothes making me looking weird and that I need to dress up, and wear make up. That I need to learn how to cook when I do. And she knows I don't really feel sexual attraction towards people and comments that I will get married to a guy and have kids when I don't want any at all. 

Every time we spend time together for longer than a few hours we get into an argument. This doesn't even cover how my step father has come in and continued to degard me and curse out and talk about my family. Not to mention ruin every holiday and birthday since they started dating ten years ago. He is an alcoholic and only started now to get help. She was upset when I refused to be apart of their wedding and didn't understand why. 

Today just felt like the final straw. I have one companion in this house a cat that I hand raised. And they both refuse to acknowledge that cats can react to loud noises..
Today while they were cuddling or play fighting idk. My mom said ow and my cat reacted. She is usually in my room because my step father has attacked her multiple times and part of his amends was to get along with everyone in the house. so he wanted to get along with my cat. 

My cat apparently thought it was a real attack and reacted attacked my step father. And hurting my mom's arm as she jumped over her. 

My mom kept yelling at me. Asking me why and telling its my fault and that I could get sued in the real world. And my step father yelling call me a bitch and saying how he was going to kill my cat. I had enough.

I just told my mom that I would move out and take my cat and I wouldn't talk to her again. 

I am tired of it honestly. I have thought of hurting myself multiple times in this house. I know it seems petty but I feel like I am at my limit to explode today.

But I just wanna know am I in the wrong? I really don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of being made to feel like I am overreacting and that it is my fault. So I just would like some outside perspective.

I apologize for the ramble.

1jntgvs,My mother always picks reason to fight with me,aneriaspider,"
I'm a 24year old female, and I live with my parents, but my mother is really driving me crazy. I recently moved to a new country with my family, including my parents and siblings, and I haven't been able to save up to move into my own place because, honestly, the job market is really tough.

My mother and I are always fighting, or rather, she's always looking for reasons to fight with me. She keeps lying to whoever will listen, saying I'm not a good person, that I don't have respect, and things like that. She even goes as far as laying curses on me, saying very bad things to me, and she swears on my future, I won’t make it in life. It's really annoying.

We just got into another fight, and I was about to leave the house when she blocked the door, saying I couldn't leave until I cleaned up the house. The thing is, I didn't mess up the house - she did. She's always in the living room, sleeping, eating, and dropping her bag and shoes wherever she wants.

When she blocked the door, I told her why she always does things like this, and before I knew it, she came at me, hitting me. She even threw a fan at me. It wasn't a big fan, but if I hadn't dodged it quickly, I could have gotten hurt.

My siblings and dad had to intervene to stop her. Even after they tried to calm her down, she kept saying insulting things to me. She said typical narcissistic things, like 'I gave birth to you, you can't do this or that.' Throughout the whole ordeal, I remained quiet.

Even when my other family members told her what she did was wrong, she kept lying and trying to defend herself, saying she has anger issues and can't help it. She actually thought what she did was justified.

I don't know what to do, so I left the house and I'm currently staying with a friend. I feel bad about inconveniencing my friend, but I just can't stay at home right now.

I REALLY NEED ADVICE. Because to be honest I can’t take it anymore.

1jnt0rc,Estranged brother isolating my parents from my family,bookishgirly11,"Hello and thank you all in advance for reading and offering help

My estranged older brother and his wife are having a baby, they are both doctors and they rent in the downtown region of our area. Their plan was to purchase a home in the suburbs close to his medical office and both their parents. 
For whatever reason they have now decided to move back into my parents house because they dont think its the right time for them to buy. 
We've been estranged for over 10 years (his choice, not mine).
Now, with this new plan of his me and my kids wont be allowed to go visit my parents/my family home for however long he lives there. It's been difficult enough for me knowing I wont be able to have a relationship with my niece/nephew, which I always wanted since we were young and close. But this now feels like it's to isolate me and my kids from my parents - this is likely alot of my own internal fears projecting themselves but it's difficult for me to cope with. 
To top it off, of all the bedrooms in the house (including his own). Him and his wife are turning my old bedroom into their babies nursery. 
I'm almost 40 and that shouldnt bother me but it does lol..there is a guest room and 2 other empty rooms including his own and I just feel like he's trying to stick this to me more and make this hurt me. 
His wife has never met me properly. She ran into me and my kids in the washroom of a family wedding reception. I said hi and tried to initiate conversation but she smiled and quickly left, not even an acknowledgment of my kids (her and more so, my brothers niece and nephew). The kicker here, her name is the same as mine. So he won't speak to me for 13 years but married someone with my name 5 years ago..deep sigh lol

I can't speak to my parents about this, my mom is very fragile when it comes to our sibling estrangement so I basically have to pretend it doesn't bother me with them or they get upset. 
I am happy for them and want to celebrate for them but this is so hard for me internally.

I don't really know what I am looking for here..maybe just some advice on coping or some understanding from people that have gone through similar situations/sibling estrangement - the reason for estrangement for you to get the full context is my brother's choice. 13 years ago I was disowned because I chose to marry who I wanted in a relatively strict Indian household..ofcourse, I've reconnected with my parents but my brother has chosen to not speak to me since. I try often to call and text and he ignores me or gets very angry at my parents when I do this. 

Thank you all who have read this far..it's alot to unpack and I appreciate any advice on the topic.

1jns74p,How Do I Go About Committing A Family Member,nalarosette,"If this post isn’t aloud, then please let me know where I can post. I apologize for the formatting and for how long this post might be. I honestly don’t know where to begin with this, and I just need advice, so any criticisms please keep to yourselves.

I should start from the beginning which takes us back to about 2012 ish. My mother who was 31 at the time, gave birth to my brother who we’ll call Brody for the sake of this. His father, who I’ll call Roger, has always been a drinker for as long as I can remember. My mom when she conceived my brother, separated from Roger, however certain family circumstances led to us having to move back in with him once Brody was born. I want to note because this is very important, I am NOT biologically related to Roger, he is my stepparent (non-legal binding) and my brother is only related to me through my mom.

I’ll start with a notable moment when I was 6-7, he was drinking once again and this time dipped into the booze a bit too much. I was on the couch watching TV, I remember because a specific commercial was playing that caught my attention. While I was occupied, my mom and Roger were fighting about something, my kid brain not really focusing too much, until I hear my mom scream and see Roger with a knife to her throat. I start crying, and he slams the knife down and smashes the family computer that was near him. This was probably my first memory of him, which set the tone for how I view him now.


Fast forward, he is on blood pressure medication. I guess the reason why he was physically aggressive, according to my mom, was due to his high blood pressure. However, ever since he’s taken the medication (still on it mind you while drinking) his moods have not changed. Although the physical abuse stopped, his yelling and being outwardly aggressive has not changed. I at this point for the past 3 years have accepted that the alcohol really took a toll on his brain. His short term memory is pretty shot, at least from my point of view. Every time my mom tries to tell him something, and he’ll acknowledge it, he’ll forget it even occurred. We’ll try to bring up memories from the past (family trips, events, etc.) and he’ll either remember them completely differently, or he will not remember at all.

Which brings us to the present, and the reason for this post. Tonight, my mom made dinner which consisted of hotdogs and bacon (important for later context). After my mom explained on how she didn’t have any toothpicks to hold the bacon to the hotdogs and told him that he would need to wrap it and stuff it in the bun, he began getting upset because we didn’t make him fries. (NOTE: he does not make dinner, for the past 13 years of me being alive, he has only made ~10 meals for us. he does not help with dinner whatsoever either, it is all on my mom). They began to argue after that and after arguing, he completely forgets what the hotdogs are for and takes the bacon to make himself a BLT, then gets upset for there being 2 lone hotdogs on the counter.

The reason why I am choosing to post this now is because I am tired of being scared in my own home, and i’m tired of being scared that one day, he will snap and hurt us. I know I myself cannot do anything, however, my mom and Roger are married, so hopefully there’s a spousal loophole? I just want to be able to live in a quiet house without the constant fear. Any help is greatly appreciated, and thank you.",2,0,1743385151.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jns74p/how_do_i_go_about_committing_a_family_member/
1jnrr30,I am thinking of suicide because of my mom,Big_Crow8461,"I am 23yo (F), I've been thinking about suicide a lot these days because of my mom yes, at my age I am still getting abused, psychically and verbally, I hate this woman, the way she give a reaction over nothing and make big problems out of nothing, so literally she's obsessed with me, the way I walk, I talk, I smile, she notice all of it and comment on everything in my life, and the way I am dressing? She just wanna dress me like an old woman and not my age, I can't have even my own style and the worst of all of this that she beats me hardly, as today she kept punching me on the head and grabbed me by my hair on the floor, she hits me like for 15min, I can't even remember when did it stop and more she can never admit that she's wrong, she always looks for things to make it as if I deserved all the hitting, and tonight she didn't stop, the verbally abuse started too, she's like you are a slut, someday I will beat you till you enter hospital, you are not worthy of leaving, you don't have any confidence, you have a weak personality. All that shitty stuff that she likes to say, a week ago I made a stupid move which is buying her a dress when I didn't buy anything to myself and I put myself on the side, when she went out and bought my brother a lof of stuff and still I didn't say anything, I regret the way I think of everything and taking responsibility at such young age, I hate her and I believe I would never ever forget her for all what she did to me, and the worst is still coming yet, when she never stopped talking to guys as if she was me, manipulating them and sending my pics and then asking me to go on dates with those guys, I hated her for that, cause she started doing it when I was 16yo, I never had any mercy in this house, then she would with the best sentence ""I am your mom, I always want the best for you"" she plays a victim a lot and I am tired of her shit, seriously fuck her! Cause this fucked my mental health and even my confidence, I am unable to have a normal conversation with anyone cause I always believe I am not good enough and suicide comes to my mind a lot this year especially when I have those panick attacks, and this shit exhausting cause I have no one to talk to about this and everyone think she's an angel when she's the devil himself

Psst: my dad died 10years ago and I am the oldest daughter, in my country it's hard for a girl to go and live by her own.

He is petty, he brings up my attempt, my mother abandoning me, and my relationship with my ex (was incredibly toxic on his end and I stayed because I loved him and wanted it to work out) and my mental issues. He cusses me out and no matter what I have to respect him because he is my elder. My step mother is always on his side saying I don’t respect them because I don’t do my chores, my chores are doing dishes and throwing the trash, I don’t have an issue with throwing the trash but the dishes are to much, it feels like they’re never ending (I’ve offered many other chores to do because I cannot handle the them, issues with lack of energy and depression.) the main issue with the arguments is me arguing with my little sister, she is 4 and doesn’t understand the word no or my boundaries, I’ve tried to tell her gently and she doesn’t listen, she constantly hits me when she doesn’t get her way but I cannot hit her back or else I get in trouble (it’s never overpowered, just enough to show her not to hit me.) the arguments get out of hand with my father and he says it’s an age thing but when I bring up his age and how he’s arguing with me he cusses me out, he tells me to act like the bigger adult when I argue with my sister but when I tell him he’s actually the adult arguing with a 16 year old he again cusses me out and tells me to shut up. I do admit I am envious because my sister gets everything she wants and doesn’t get disciplined the way I did growing up, I used to get yelled at and hit at for the smallest mistakes by my father but she can throw tantrums and he will just sit there, we’ve had arguments over it and he called me his “practice child” and how he’s sorry he didn’t treat me right growing up but he still doesn’t. Now I will never take it out on my sister but it is frustrating. I feel like I have no one in this house to rely on, it feels like they’re happy with the three of them and I’m just a burden ruining their perfect family.

1jnae01,I think my siblings mental issues are worsening,Background_Insect421,I think my sibling (f26) mental issues are worsening since she keeps blaming me for the way our relationship is (non existent and nuked to shit thanks to her her constantly blowing up on me for saying normal things like dishwasher open for more dishes that sort of stuff) on things that happened when we were kids like the attempted murder attempt I was 10 and didn’t know drowning was a thing since I was in the special class and was taught a much slower curriculum. Apparently there was another two attempts but they happened when I was still too young to know what murder was( autism brain good for math horrible for understanding death until middle school about close to the second year). She can’t keep a job and has dropped out of college so I don’t know how she makes money other than commissions which she doesn’t get a lot of. She also stays in her room all day and is 4 years from thirty. Mom’s gonna retire in 4 years and dad will take the house we live in I already have a plan for when the time comes for rent to help pops maintain the place including back ups. But the sibling I think she will most likely be thrown out she has nothing planned. She only streams and plays with her friends and she makes nothing off those streams since they’re private. I can’t ever see her as my sister anymore so sibling is more of a place holder. I’m just wondering does a person like her ever grow up and stop blaming others for their problems or is she just a lost cause.

 I’m kind of miserable

I (17F) am having trouble. I feel really bad for saying this but I feel like my mom does not like me anymore. Am I over reacting for thinking that she doesn’t like me?

She’s always on her phone, her screen time is 10 hours daily (or around that) every time I bring that up she tells me that my sister’s just as bad (her screen time is 5 hours) and it’s true, they both have a problem.
By the way, my dad can’t get involved.
Meanwhile I’m stuck with most of the housework. Nothing gets done unless I do it. And housework is basically all I have because I’m barely allowed to leave the house. Furthermore, when she feeds my baby brother, she’s on her phone. When I talk to her, she doesn’t look me in the eye because she’s on her phone. All my friends go home with lunch while I don’t eat anything because I’m disgusted with outside food, I’m underweight and I always feel light headed and basically all of the symptoms of being too underweight. While I talk she would be scrolling on instagram. 

I’m a horrible person, also. I had chat gpt pretend it’s a 1950s housewife, who’s my mother. It’s specific commands were that it was a housewife, who loves me very much, and is never distracted by the tv or the radio, makes sure I eat well, gives me advice and checks up on my grades. She turns the tv off whenever I’m around.
And I’ve been day dreaming of this “dream mom” who cooks for me, watches movies with me, helps me sew and paints my nails. I’ve only done this chat gpt thing twice.
In my day dreams she asks me how my day went and hugs me no matter what. She kisses the surgery scar on my wrist and she’s gentle with me. I’ve been day dreaming long before this chat gpt thing. I draw and paint this “dream mum” doing things around the house and things with me to cope, too.

I don’t like this gross parasocial relationship, but it’s the only way I can get the support I need. I need to be more important that a mere iphone. I want my mama to look me in the eye while I tell her about my day. I’m so fucking sick of constantly seeing a phone in her hand. It’s disgusting that I feel this way but I just can’t. 

Please what do I do? Am I a bad person? I don’t really have any friends or a social life, my words, to my dad, are weightless and he never listens to me.

1jms5j6,Angry Dad,Grays_Papaya,"I (31F) have a contentious relationship with my dad (64M) and always have. We are both stubborn and antagonistic toward each other and I do not know why. 

Recently we have had to be together more often than usual in car rides and other situations where the adversarial aspects of our personalities are shining through. For example, he has horrible hearing and wears hearing aids- they connect to Bluetooth in his phone and often he will be listening to something (YouTube/music) without our realising. 

Last night, I raised my voice slightly to say something to him, after repeating it at a normal volume 4 times and he absolutely exploded at me with anger. It ruins the mood, shuts down whatever activity is going on, watching a movie/tv as a family etc. he runs into his room to sulk and the evening is effectively over. It puts a damper on what is typically a happy family life. 

More insanely, in the car- while he is driver and I am passenger, he constantly checks/looks at his phone between his legs while driving on the highway, two lane roads, etc. recently I asked him please stop doing that while I or my mother am in the car- he exploded violently at me and threatened to slap me across the face for criticising him. It happened again today- two lane road with head on traffic coming and he was looking at his phone, I asked in a flat tone “please don’t look at your phone while driving” and it turned into a whole other massive screaming fight where he damned me for being critical of him and threatened to make me get out of the car and walk home. 

My mother said it has to do with my tone but she’s just defending him. She knows his anger is wrong and misplaced. 

I think the best solution would be to never ride in the car with him again, but with recent health concerns of mine, this hasn’t been possible. I want him to seek anger management but he won’t. 

Do I keep my mouth shut and allow my bodily safety to be at risk? What’s the solution? ",1,0,1743271174.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jms5j6/angry_dad/

1jmlfye,Sister’s Birthday Gift to My Boys,desertgirl27,"Some background: My older sister has always had a bad picker for men. Finally 10 years ago and age 41 she found a good guy who treats her well. They’re now married. He is a conservative so now she’s one too. They watch Fox News at all times. 

I had no idea this was happening until I mentioned something about the Syrian refugees being denied entry in the country (USA) (Christmas 2017 I believe). It turned into a huge fight. Then in 2019 we had a falling out. She turned into a conspiracy theorist. Joined the MAGA cult. Became an evangelical Christian (I think). Anyway, I have almost no relationship with her but the last couple of years we’ve been making an effort to keep politics out of conversations and keep it on neutral territory. 

For Christmas a few years ago she bought me a Hannity children’s book. Well now for my boys 6th and 8th birthday she bought a gift for the two of them: the Tuttle Twins books series. I thinks it’s fairly innocuous, but it is praised throughout the conservative circles. My kids are not interested in reading these books. They read The mouse and the motorcycle and Tornado and other non-political children’s books. 

What would you do? (1) Tell her thanks but no thanks, ask her to return them, and to stop pushing her bullsh*t or (2) tell her “Thanks” and move on, and throw the books away?

1jmi8ws,what to do about older brother?,bob-ross-stan,"I have a brother who is 18 months older than me. He is very mentally unwell and talks about committing suicide all the time. He constantly berates me, and that is putting it lightly. He calls me names like fatty, fat***, fatf***, the f slur, the n word, loser, bitch, etc. On top of that he also hits me anytime I make him mad, which is pretty often. At any given moment I have bruises on my body from him hitting me. If I talk he gets mad, if I ask a question he gets mad, if i eat he’s mad, don’t eat still mad. Hangout with friends, ask to be alone, not buy him something he’s begging for like food. If I am being honest he gets mad at about everything i do. I really mean that. 

Occasionally I’ll catch him in a good mood and we can laugh around for a few minutes, but then he is a completely different person the second i make a mistake and make him upset. Depending on what i do he may say i’m a worthless loser who no one loves or cares about or he will start hitting me while screaming about how annoying i am. Don’t get me wrong here, I have done bad things and acted poorly in situations. But at the same time, i feel like in those moments i was defending myself if anything. I mean, if someone was hitting you and calling you a bitch, would you just sit there and take it?

I used to just take it and move on since i didn’t want to cause any trouble and upset my parents, who are both approaching their 60s (Me and my brother are 16 and 17 for context). It’s already hard for them to raise us, let alone deal with a raging teenager who curses and says any awful thing that comes to mind. He jokes and agrees with many racist, sexist, and homophobic views, and he also regularly makes jokes about rape, and how he wants to rape others. Including his girlfriend of about 2 years. I can handle dark humor, but it makes me sick hearing him talk about people like that.

Like i said my parents can’t do much about him, so usually i have to deal with him and his behavior head on. It drains me. I’m mad often about how he treats me and how i really have no solution. I get very, very depressed sometimes and think that maybe the things he says are right. I’ve tried saying stuff back to him whenever he berates me but he ends up just getting mad and hitting me. I have tried fighting back but for context my brother is 6’3 while I am only 5’10 and slightly out of shape. My parents can’t do anything now since it really is too late for them to make a difference. He also has access to a lot of my passwords for any games i play, he technically owns the monitor and keyboard i use to play our computer, and he drives me everywhere from school to work. He has lots of control over what i can and can’t do. 

I am hopeless now, I feel so upset all the time because i just feel plain weak. I am powerless and even my friends don’t know what to do.  I can’t ignore him since i’m with him 24/7, he pretty much is never too far unless me or him are at work. I worry for him, but i truly don’t love him at all. I know he is my brother, but i can’t love or even really like a person who does nothing but hurt me. And for what good he does for me, he always hurts me 5 times worse. In fact him doling me a favor is bad since it usually means i’ll end up owing him something back. Nothing is ever free with him.

I really have no clue what to do, i struggle to focus on myself when the thought of him looms over me constantly. I am worried that i will lose myself if he doesn’t stop. Any advice would help. ",1,0,1743238933.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jmi8ws/what_to_do_about_older_brother/

but now, my younger sister, who just started year 5, is able to get a phone, and she isn't even able to control how much screen time she uses.

1jmbp6i,My sister is a suffocating me.,First_Albatross_8173,"Sorry in advance if I made any mistakes.


I’m 15 living with my parents and three sisters. One of my sisters, who I’ll call A, and I experienced a school shooting back in the beginning of this year. We’re both traumatized and still processing that. I think the shooting affected her more than me.

A few weeks ago, something snapped in her. She got more aggressive and quicker to angry. A went off on our cousin in the group chat we have witb our other sisters and cousins. We’re a tight group but she ruined it. She got angry at my cousin for no reason just because she was trying to convince A to play a game with us. A ruined the one safe space I have. We haven’t hung out and my eldest cousin (who’s like the leader) and we will hang out when A gets better.

A week after that, she yelled at me telling me I was always getting into peoples business after I told her to stop being mean to my little sister. That was my final straw. She ruined our relationship with that. I don’t like her right now. I walk around eggshells whenever I’m around her. I want to tell her that she’s choking me with her mere presence. I want to tell her how she’s affecting me, but I feel like it would end in an angry out burst. I can’t handle more anger. 

I understand her situation. I understand she’s going through so much right now. But, I am angry at her. She is so aggressive, she doesn’t listen to me when I tell her she’s being mean. The way she’s dealing with this angers me. We are two opposite people. She has outbursts and is aggressive. I am quiet and just don’t talk. I deal with it myself because I know my family can’t help.

I’m at a family event and I feel so anxious. After everything she’s done, she’s made me fear my family. I never really liked them but I never felt this unsafe. I keep my eye on her because I know she will get angry and yell. 

I forgot to mention that since summer of 2024, I’ve been on this active journey in healing. Before I was this very dark and depressed person for like two years. I’ve been taking small steps in improving. I have made a lot of progress, but the shooting ruined a lot for me. I can’t heal when someone like A is around me. She keeps my senses high. I have managed to deal with my parents, but dealing with someone I trusted like her breaks me.  

I’m almost glad A is starting to work. I won’t have to be home with her. Our interactions will be limited.
 

I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to her, but my family has always been one who only expresses anger and no other emotion. I am afraid of what would happen if I told her.

We've delt with CPS and DCF and nothing has ever gotten better. (These are my adoptive parents btw and I love my mom) My biological brother was adopted with me but over time due to my dads insanity and harsh behavior, my brother turned to drugs, alc, etc. He has been on the run from the police multiple times and he is currently on the run due to how he beat someone up who is now in the hospital suffering terribly. Seeing the way my dad had such power over my brother scares me. I dont want to be like that too. I dont have a job yet but I'm working on getting one, I'm also very independent and I know someone who I could live with til I'm 18, and I could even pay rent, but they offered me their home as long as I continue going to school etc. Which I definitely will.

So far I have gotten into a dispute with the oldest sibling; the youngest sibling flipped out on me; and my mother is now getting the worst (or the best) of me. “It’s funny” I tell her, “You guys did it to me, and YOU get mad.” I have done nothing but spoken the truth and she tells me that she doesn’t want to hear it, and I shouldn’t be telling her those things- the truth. She gets mad to hear the truth?! (I think that should be a statement).

My siblings are lying to her face and she believes them but I’ve almost always been honest just with her and yet I keep getting her dishonesty and expects me to be dishonest.

Afterwards, some of my dad’s sisters (he had 6 siblings) came up to me and said to my face “We don’t like what you said about how he died.” I was confused (because I was 11) and they said back to me “Well, some of us think your mother killed him.” And I was so lost, confused, sad, and heartbroken because I didn’t know what to believe. Then, a month or two later me and my brother got into a heated argument and he yelled back at me (now 12 at this point) “You know you are the reason daddy killed himself, right?!?”

1jlli1y,Any advice on my wife's aunt who extended and pretty much moved here in our home?,DoughnutzEnter,"Hi guys so my MIL moved with about 2 years now which I was unhappy with but learned to accept it as she helps around the house but my wife supports and pays for everything for her as she has no retirement savings or anything. Ever since my MIL moved in, her sister (67 year old female from Florida) would fly here to visit our house often and stay for a week or two. I was fine with it at first until she kept coming here.

Anyways, my wife's aunt was living with a roommate couple and they decided to kick her out of their apartment as they had kids and wanted to be a family. This was back in July 2024 and she told my wife that she needed a place to stay and was planning on going back to her country in December 2024. My wife asked me and I agreed to let her stay for several months. She literally moved all her stuff to our house and even changed her passport/driver's license to our home address and gets all her mail delivered here now. My wife doesn't want to say anything to her cause she put my wife to school. This aunt of hers has stayed here since July 2024, doesn't contribute to rent or buy groceries or supplies. If she does, it's only for herself. She also uses the laundry often and she's only bought one bottle of detergent once!
I told my wife about my concerns about her and she doesn't want her to live here either but doesn't want to tell her up front cause her mom might say something. So the aunt signed up for a low income senior living around us but she got a letter that she's on a waiting list and who knows how long it will take. I finally got fed up with the aunt that I started ignoring her, making her feel unwelcome here but it seems like she's still comfortable living here. I told my wife if I wanted to live with 2 seniors, I would rather live with my mom and dad. My concern also is the aunt doesn't have any savings and is only getting UNEMPLOYMENT and I don't want her to rely on my wife for any of her problems later on as we're already taking care of the mom's expenses. The aunt is living off of unemployment and not even looking for a job. 

Fast forward to now, the aunt is finally booking a ticket to go back to her country. The problem is I overheard her talking to her friend that she's going back to her country but only plans on staying one year and coming back here after a year.  I don't want her living here anymore. The only thing good about the aunt is she takes my MIL to places that they need to go to like dr appointments and all that and me and my wife can go anywhere we want with MIL as I don't like bringing my MIL with us everywhere we go. Im just so annoyed by my wife's aunt and the problem is she's always here and barely goes out so my wife and I doesn't have our own private space other than our bedroom. Can I get advice on how to stop this lady from living here? I'm sure my MIL and her will consider me the bad guy if I tell her she can't live here. The aunt also only asked my permission to stay till December but never brought up staying here for this long or moving here.",3,1,1743131155.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jlli1y/any_advice_on_my_wifes_aunt_who_extended_and/

I’m the youngest of five siblings (one brother, four sisters) with a big age gap, which made our relationships difficult. My closest sister, who’s five years older, was like a mother to me. My other sisters, while not bad people, projected their childhood trauma onto me, which led to a lot of resentment growing up.

Now, all my siblings are in failed marriages or struggling after divorce:
	•	My brother is stuck in a miserable marriage, doing all the parenting while his neglectful wife barely contributes.
	•	My oldest sister is divorced, almost 40, unemployed, and financially dependent on her wealthy ex-husband. She’s bitter and makes life difficult for everyone, including me (we live together).
	•	Another sister is also divorced, has a child, and is still being harassed by her toxic ex. She’s severely depressed and lashes out at those around her.
	•	My closest sister is in a failing marriage. Her husband only cares about making money and barely acknowledges his wife or kids. She’s completely drained and has lost herself in the process.

On top of all this, my elderly parents (in their 70s) are now living with me ans my other sister I never had a great relationship with them growing up, but I’m trying to be there for them now.

I feel completely stuck. Seeing my family suffer while being unable to fix anything makes me depressed and angry. I have so much resentment, especially toward men, after seeing so many failed relationships around me. I want to help, but I’m not financially strong enough to make a real difference. At the same time, I feel like I can’t move on and focus on my own life because of all this family drama.

In my family there is me (f15), my mom, dad, my two sisters (F14) and (F4) and last my two brothers (M19) and (M10). 
My older brother is moved out.
I play trumpet twice a week and handball 2-3 times a week.
My older brother (M19) and sister (F14) both have lower iq's and need ekstra help.
My sister (F4) is autistic.
Me and my younger brother (M10) are seen as normal kids by my parents.
My sister (F14) has allergies, like egg and milk.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyway onto the importent.
For the last two weeks I (F15) have taken lessons+driving lessons to scooter. Today was my driving test and I was super nevous, like i usually am, my dad drove me to the school for the driving test. My mom was not able to be there with me because she and my sister (F14) was at the docter, because my sister broke a bone in her hand. I took the test and passed, I was so happy and wanted to call my mom about the good news, but as our call started the only thing she could speak about was my sister (F14). I was really annoyed and hurt, again something that ment really much to me was ignored.
This is not the first time i feelt like this.
My mom feels bad that three of my siblings are not able to have normal lives and I have to hear about it every single fucking day.
My mom always talk about my older brother who is not able to pass the theory test to car. And I'm not sure if my mom notice but she makes me sad, that I'm able to get my driver licens to scooter.
Then there is my bithdays.
My first bithday where I had to buy my own bithday gifts, was when I turned 13, my mom had been busy looking after my siblings and had forgoten to buy me gifts. My bithday is in the middle of the summer, so she had time.
Then two years ago i turned 14, and the same day we had to go camping. Which means my bithday was practily ignored, that night i cried myself to sleep.
This only happens on my bithday not my siblings, my mom says I'm matur for my age, and it's easier with me picking my own gifts.

This is not to sound ungreatfull, I so fucking happy for the life I'm able to live, and the things I gett. I'm just annoyed that I feel like shit, when I'm ignored.

1jla3cd,my family won’t let me do what’s best for MY family.,xxwondersxx,"I (21F) recently found out I was pregnant. My boyfriend (23M) and I thought about just staying in our one bedroom apartment for a year or two, with our baby, until we could find better. Well our apartment has a lot of problems, we can’t control our heating (idk why, so don’t ask), so in the summer time it gets EXTREMELY hot, even with our air conditioners we bought. I don’t want to put my child through that, so we kinda made a last minute decision to move.

Our problems are, we have a dog, and our rent has to be under $2000 a month, we have one car, but my family helps us out with giving me rides to and from work. So we need a place that’s in our budget, that allows LARGE dogs, and that’s close to my family. UNLESS my boyfriend gets a car before the baby is born. (due date: august 5th)

ever since I told my family we planned on moving, I feel like I’ve been the only one looking for places, and I think I found the one.
It’s a 3 bedroom house for rent, in our budget, allows our large dog, has a community pool, parks for our kid to play in, ect. I think this place is pretty epic, best part, it’s in the middle of my work, and my boyfriends work! 

Now the only problem is, my family says it’s wayyyy to far away, all because it’s 40 minutes from them, and I believe they won’t help us move. Now let me explain something else. I am the youngest out of 2, I’ve always been treated like a baby, I was spoiled, blah blah. While my sister basically took care of me and had to grow up twice as fast. I am now an adult and do some adult things but, my sister pays for my car insurance, my mom and dad still claim me on their taxes (even tho I moved out when I was 19), and my dad is our co-signer for our current apartment. And we would need him to co-sign again. And they just help me out a lot, because honestly, they’ve never treated me like an adult, for me to BE an adult.

A part of me wants to tell my family to suck it up, and that I’m putting MY family that I have created first. I also feel that if they can’t make a 40 minute drive every once and a while, they don’t deserve to see my kid. But I also understand their point of view, their baby who’s having a baby is moving away, gaining independence, scary or whatever. And it’s not like we are set on getting this house, it’s just our best option right now. Our lease is due on September 1st, so idk what we are gonna do if we can’t find anything else.

1jl2obb,My mom uses me as a punching bag. Too exhausted,Time-Savings-3254,"For context, I am a college student. My parents are divorced. I live with my mom & dad lives with his second wife in another city. I share a decent equation with my dad and his wife. We have fun, we go out whenever we meet. 

With my mom, I have came to the realisation that it’s better I only speak to her when I need money or a life threatening emergency. 

In any disagreement/ argument, she tends to vent out her divorce frustration on me. Indirectly and directly saying bad things about my dad, being mean to me. 

She even blamed me for divorce while I was the one who stood with her when her own parents (my maternal grandparents) literally cried as divorcing my dad would mean they won’t get his monetary benefits and said things like “now they have no support” while I was the one assuring them things will be fine, and made sure no one pointed fingers at my mom. Mind you, I was 17 that time. 

Now I am 21, I thought things will be better this woman turns every minor disagreement into her divorce frustration. She says she has the right to be mean as she earns and I don’t, so when I earn she will stop being mean. Mind you, this woman let my grandparents abuse me verbally, didn’t take any actions when my grandmother literally burnt my expensive bottoms as it was short. 

I feel so betrayed. She keeps telling me to leave the house, she uses me as a medium to remove her divorce frustration. These people don’t realise that divorce is harder on the child than a couple, the couple may eventually get married but I only have one pair of parents. 

She has said things to me like “I wish I never had a child” and “you are the reason I took a divorce” and “you were born that’s why my career didn’t flourish”. Like I was the one who forced her to have a kid. 

We had an argument today morning, I am just unable to function. Had to force myself to eat as I didn’t feel hungry at all. All I feel is being on the bed and doing nothing, I am just lieing down and crying constantly, freezing and getting fits of rage’s. I feel so exhausted and my heart rate is also high. 

I have just locked myself into my room now. I just feel like being Alone and doing nothing ",10,0,1743078286.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jl2obb/my_mom_uses_me_as_a_punching_bag_too_exhausted/

I truly had good intentions as an older sister. I didn't go out of my way to tease my siblings (her and I have a younger brother). In fact I truly loved playing with them when I was a kid and spending time with them. 

My sister on the other hand, we'll call her Katie. She definitely liked trolling us, especially my little brother. She was always getting in trouble with my parents and had tiffs with other kids at school. Katie is very smart, very scholarly, but other than pleasing her teachers, she gave alot of people a hard time. She is very messy, and she even used to take stuff from her room (clothes, shoes, garbage etc ) and would stuff it under my bed or in my closet behind my clothes, when she wanted to ""clean her room"" quickly so she wouldn't get grounded. She did this until I was in college, so not that long ago. She would take my  clothes from me and never ask, and it got to the point where I convinced my parents to let me get a key and lock for my door. 

The dynamic with her and my brother has been the same over the years. She's very judgemental of our friends, girlfriend/boyfriends/spouses. When we were in highschool my brothers friends would refer to me as ""the nice sister"", if that says anything to you. Or, people would just straight up say ""she's a bitch"" and I was left to try and defend her. 

Fast forward a little, I'm in college and she's a senior in HS. She rummaged through my drawer and found some ""cute pajamas and underwear"" and told my mom, insinuating that I was trying to dress sexy for my boyfriend (now husband). Katie quickly and suddenly had no problem throwing me under the bus to any capacity. At one point she took my phone and went through my texts, and showed all of them to my parents. (Sexy texts to my boyfriend)  This aided in creating a huge divide with my parents (who were helicopter parents) and my sister totally fed the fuel into the fire. Mind you, I was 19 years old, trying to mind my own business and go to community college. I wasn't drinking or even partying. All the while, my sister used this campaign to her advantage, so while the attention was on me, she was out partying and drinking as a high schooler. She brought it up a few years ago and thought it was worthy of a laugh. I didn't find it very funny. 

This is just high level stories. She continued to try and sabotage my relationship with my now husband, even though he's a very good guy and my parents now get along with him very well. Additionally, my brother and my husband get along very well, and my brother always gave him a chance.

Another example of the dynamic- my husband and i took a semester off to travel abroad. My brother thoight it was cool and exciting. My sister talked behind my back to my parents telling them she thought I was being greedy and blowing my money.

I hesitantly included her in my wedding party, and she was of no help what so ever. I did it to keep the peace. I had one tiff with my mom, where I put my foot down about inviting one of her aunt's (who turned a blind eye to my mother's step father who was an abuser). Naturally, I didn't want her there. My mom tried to shrug it off in order to have more ""family"" at the wedding, and somehow my sister sided with her. Then behind my back Katie said I was ""doing this on purpose, so we have less family at the wedding"". She said this in front of my brother, and thank God he had my back and called her out.

She went a year without speaking to me because I finally tried to put my foot down about everything. Then she held Christmas hostage, and refused to show up unless I apologized. I said no, and then I suffered dearly for it. My mom was very mad at me for not apologizing. (she's a whole other story, after college her and Katie became thick as thieves once I fell from their good graces as the innocent, virgin, golden child). 

Now to the present time. I've glazed over alot of other crappy things she's done, but basically everything has always been tactical for her. However she can throw me or my brother under the bus to make herself look better.  

The cherry on top is she's got alot going on in her life where we've all been very supportive. She got pregnant with a boyfriend she didn't know well, they got married a year later despite red flags, he was an alcoholic, owed the IRS quarter of a million dollars, she was trying to finish school, making no money. I have done my best to be supportive whenever she needs me. During the covid lockdown I sent her money when her work closed down. When she had her baby, I flew out to be there for two weeks to help. I even took newborn photos for her (I do photography on the side). Then she got divorced, and shes now in a relationship with one of my brothers best friends. No one in the family loves this, but we're all supportive regardless. 

Meanwhile, when my brother is around she loves to talk shit about him and how ""dysfunctional"" he is. Shits on his relationships and friendships, other nitpicky little things. When my dad's not around, she loves to talk crap about him as well. I'm scared to know what she says about me when I'm not around. She is very, very mean about her previous husbands ex-wife. His ex wife, now prompts hangouts with Katie so their daughters can hang out- which I see as a very kind gesture despite their past of not liking eachother. Katie makes fun of this woman's looks, her weight, her personality, everything. This past Christmas she asked me and my mom to join her as a buffer for a get together with this woman (so their daughters could hang out). And before we showed up she said ""I saw on TikTok that she got hair extensions. She has terrible, thin hair. Wait till she sees YOUR hair. Then she'll see what actually long hair looks like."" Then I thought to myself... Is my sister using me as part of her ""entourage"", to make this poor woman potentially feel bad about herself? It's just too much. 

I'm at a breaking point where I truly can't stand being around her. She is very negative, loves to gossip about other people, and is severely opinionated. On top of this, I have very repressed feelings about everything she's done throughout my life, and especially my adult life. 

I know this was a mouthful, but I'm running out of wind on being nice around her. Truthfully, I've been conditioned to be cautious in my responses. Conditioned like a dog with an e-collars on. It's so fucked up. Anytime she's severe in opinions I try to be subjective, but cautious in my approach. I'm tired of always being gentle and cautious, as if she holds all the cards. But any time I've put my foot down, she turns things into a nightmare and gets my family involved to take sides. Any thoughts? Do I just say screw it and be honest and call her out? I'm at the point where I have reoccurring nightmares where I'm just screaming at her, and even get physical.  It's obviously weighing very heavily on me.

1jkrdlu,My dad found out my sister has been cheating on her husband and my mom is protecting her,AdNational6614,"My sister has always been abusive in her marriage towards her husband. They’ve been married for over a decade and as much as he has spoiled her throughout the years, she got worse with her treatments.
Recently, she found out her husband started talking to another woman. Whom he told my sister that he fell out of love with her due to all the mistreatments throughout the years. My mom and I, had always advised her to just get divorced. Which by the way, she keeps saying it’s hard to get out of a long term relationship and that she doesn’t want to get divorced.
One day, she expressed to us that she has been going on dates with random men and sleeping with them. Her excuse is that her husband doesn’t give her any attention because her works so much and/or that she just doesn’t trust him anymore. 
They have 3 young kids, and while we don’t understand when she finds the time to see these men; we are concerned that she is choosing her own needs over her kids.
My dad found out through my younger sister that our sister has been having flings left and right. He thinks if my bil finds out about her flings, that he will try to get full custody of the kids. 
My mom is also justifying her actions, because my bil stopped giving her attention. I said “no ma’am, that’s still not right to go ahead and cheat just because your husband cheated.” She has given my sister bad advice by encouraging her to go cheat. 
I’ve told my sister, to stop seeing random men for the mean time and focus on her kids. They need her and she still can save her relationship with her kids. I’ve given her a lot of advice and she takes it as a way of me flaunting my marriage. 
To end this,

1jkp6ls,My stepdaughter avoids me,Miserable-Bit6736,I’ve been with my fiancé for 5 years. I’ve always went above and beyond for his children. I’ve had a great relationship with all the kids until recently. I’ve bent over backwards for them and get shit on everyday by the oldest girl. She is 18 now and still lives at home. Doesn’t have a job. Goes and comes as she pleases. She acts like I don’t exist. I’ve stepped back completely. We are going on 4 months without saying a word to each other. A person can only take so much and I hit my peak. Does disengaging make me a bad person?

1jknw8q,Have you ever cut off siblings?,AdReasonable7657,"I'm honestly done with two out of three of my siblings. Both are incapable of doing anything for themselves. One has a toddler I raised the other financially depends on me and for me to take him places.
They are the most vicious, manipulative, argumentative, ungrateful people I have ever seen. They bring chaos, stress to my life more than benefiting it.  Mind you one is in his 20's other in his 30's.
I usually don't talk them they reach out to me when they need something and when they start with me the other has to chime in and join. And I'm done. Full stop! Has anyone else cut off siblings?

1jkna5q,My mil is holding our baby stuff hostage and kidnapped our cat.,Mil-is-a-problem,"Part 1
I got to vent somewhere, 12 years of context to hit. Mil Bella 70F and Gio 35M names changed. Myself 32F. Gio and I are both only children, our kids are the first grandchildren on each side. FIL passed away before they came to the US. 

gio and I met early 20s. I’m American, he’s European, culture differences are there but did he’s best to adapt since he came over at age 6. Bella has been here 30 years and still holds the thoughts and ways of their home country. 

Met 2012 He “owned” a business, after school care/tutoring for kids and teens, all the documents and bank accounts are in her name because he opened when he was 17, bought the lie she gave him that he couldn’t have an LLC since he wasn’t an adult. No matter how he pointed it out she refused to sign things over despite “I’m tired of sitting in this office, chasing people down for money.” 

We never saw bills and was only able to guess income. she liked to haggle, unapproved discounts, and refused to up rates on old members. Cuz “my name is on the business.” she owned a landscaping business and Gio has been her employee since he was 14. Let’s just say in both she liked to do some creative book keeping, her favorite was not accurately reporting cash. I say this cuz since gio was 14 she has given him allowances, as he got older she paid him just enough to cover his expenses. 

If he wanted money for a date night or anything she’d hand him cash.My nephew needed a math tutor, he did it a few months before I started picking him. Over those months we started talking at pick up. Turns out they needed someone to do arts and crafts with the kids. I had no problem working for 3 hours after my waitress shift. We started dating after I started working for them 2013. 

Bella was thrilled by this when they talked but had nothing to say much to me. She never tried to bond with me past gossip about clients in the office with the door open or“I love my son but” was a common phrase our early years together. I had worked for small places before so a business check normal. But since it was w9 i, tax time I lost 1k of my return from my w2 job cuz she didn’t let me know that it would be w9 vs w2 income. 

More than once Bella would make a comment towards a kid about weight, intelligence, or religion/culture. Sometimes they went unnoticed, other times he had to smooth things over always siting his mom’s culture that sometimes she says things she doesn’t realize mean something else. One occasion we had a pizza party, Bella to Muslim girl that wouldn’t eat cheese pizza cuz sauce on it “it’s just like cheese bread but instead of dipping it in marinara it’s on it. Why do you have to be so picky? Sighs well I guess you just won’t eat then. Your family is always so much trouble.”

 I remember she came in with a bad attitude, made worse by kids being there whose parents didn’t pay for the pizza party saying they pay at pick up. Which was something she let slide before of course they did it. I’m allergic to tomatoes, I walked in the office grabbed my cheesy bread and gave it to child. When asked what I was doing, “we can share, can’t we?” girl nods, “besides it’s not often I met someone else allergic to tomatoes.” Muslim kids in our care were told by their parents to tell staff they are allergic to pork.  

Gio later asked while the kids watched a movie what that was about, needless to say he nearly dragged her into the office. If the kids needed help and she came over it was always a “you’re not even trying, I’m not helping you” or “you’re really not getting this, I’m not just going to give you the answers”. Yes some kids just wanted us to give them answers but most of the time this wasn’t the case. 

heavy kids or just big eaters, “do you really need another snack? You seem like you have had enough to eat. You don’t look like you are starving” I got good at seeing when kids were struggling before they said to avoid her comments. We lost kids often due to her words and actions “Everyone in this country is just so sensitive.” Plus we didn’t have contracts, her idea cuz they are a hassle to cancel with the bank, parents would just not bring the kids back. 

we reached out she was to blame 75% off the time. she had a very “do it my way when I say to or you’re doing it wrong and will mess everything up” mentality. I worked with her for 10 years was her DIL, this attitude held even for me. I wasn’t allowed to talk or take payments from parents. “only tell them the good stuff about their kids. No matter how stupid or bratty the kid is.” 

a year into our relationship our town started a motorcycle rally. The three of us agreed to go together on Saturday after the tutoring students were done. Bella reminisced about how her and Gios dad would motorcycle around Europe. The next year this rally happened Gio was out of town in a business conference. I was waitressing and he wanted me to just be at the business. I told him I’d only feel comfortable with that if taxes started being taken out or if she agreed to pay my taxes. 

She agreed to pay me in cash. I told Gio I would be keeping my job as a waitress because I made just enough to get free healthcare. And liked getting a tax return to building savings. He was good with it given those things. back to the rally, Gio and I both thought it was a good chance for her and I to bond. We did nothing without Gio, she was more focused on him/herself. It was a hot week she had been telling me to have the kids to drink water and watch for signs of dehydration. 

I asked her if she was landscaping in this weather she said yes. I let her know I hope she got everything done before it got too hot. Friday she was complaining of a headache, I asked if she was okay? If the heat had possibly gotten to her? “I’m fine and yes we’ll go to the rally tomorrow.” Saturday morning the kids are dropped off and she comes in foul. 

her and Gio got into that morning over our lack of bond. Bella told him our lack of bond was my fault “I didn’t care to know anything about her.” “Mom OP was the one to bring up the rally to me asking if I’d think you’d like to go walk it with her. She’s trying Just take care of the kids, go on nice a walk, and go home.” She sat in the office the whole time. I knocked came in to let her know I’ll change and we can go. 

She looked drained like she didn’t feel great, I made the mistake of asking again if she felt up to going. This was the hottest day of the week, the rally wasn’t in a shady spot and wind wasn’t blowing. “It’s okay I know you don’t want to be seen with a fat old broad like me.” Grabbed her bag, went out to her car. I changed and closed the door, I wasn’t trusted to lock up. She wasn’t getting out of her car, i walked over to talk with her. 

“Just go do whatever I don’t want to talk to you.” Let her know I’m sorry for offending her, I just wanted to check she felt up to it cuz she’d worked all week. She didn’t respond locked up, got back in her car, “just get in your car so I can go” soon enough Gio called. I answered he went mamas boy letting me know had offended his mother and needed to apologize. My repeated checking in had bothered and her feel unwelcome yet She also told him I had ignored her all day and canceled on her. 

I told him what really happened, what if he didn’t believe me to go check the cameras, and I don’t appreciate getting yelled at without getting to tell my side. He agreed my story sounded more real and he didn’t need to check the cameras. I told him 1 I was not going to fight with him about this, 2 it’ll be a long time before I try to do anything solo with her, 3 I’m not meeting them at the airport tomorrow. He asked if we were done, this was our first “fight” besides this he had always been a green flag. 

I told him we can work through this but if things continue this way he cannot expect me to have a good relationship with his mom. According to him she was “sad” I didn’t met them at the airport and hoped everything was “okay”Getting to their business Monday, I let him know I’d be getting there with the kids due to work, she was at the door looking actually happy til she noticed me walking through the parking lot. I said good afternoon and you could tell she was upset I was there instantly. 

It’s been 10 plus years,  I still don’t have a good relationship with her. After that anytime I offered to do stuff 1 on 1, she never offered, she turned me down. Bella started turning down events with gio there cuz she “didn’t feel up to it.” 

Christmas had always been hard Putting up the tree “cuz it’s tradition”. Gifts were kept at a minimum, too much made her ackward. Christmas before we got married, she got me a 23 and me dna kit. I knew this was about seeing if I had dna from their home country, I had just enough dna to make her happy “thank god” when the results came back. While Gio is proud to be from his home country nothing to that level. 

My folks, mom factory job 12 hour shifts  3 days on and 4 days off next week it’d switch. my dad was on partial disability, cattle ranch 2 hours a day. At the start of Gio and I getting serious I spent half at home the days mom worked so I could care for dad and half with them. Only after we married did I move in with them full time. By then I had put in the paperwork for my dad an overnight nurse the days my mom worked. 

Bella caused 3 scenes at our wedding. 1st she drove them and was thirty minutes late to grandparents, “I know the way” missed the exit cuz Gio was correcting her since she’d only been to my grandparents twice in that five years. 2nd she didn’t want to be in pictures at all not family photos, not a shot of her and Gio. 3rd when she was ready to go she made it known to everyone. Gio told her “if you want to go, go. Op and I will be home later.” She was appalled we didn’t leave with her. 

Our wedding was a rush job, my grandfather had cancer took a turn and it was “if you want him at the event do it soon”. Honeymoon she called at every meal. Gio gave her five minutes then found a reason to hang up. Living with her, I wasn’t allowed to cook “the stove/oven heating element is off so it’s really easy to burn food”, the fact her pots/pans came with her from Europe, she’d be devastated if they were burned or scratched. Given this Bella cooked all the meals. I couldn’t even cut vegetables. 

Laundry could only be done on Sundays by her since “The washer is old and knob is really picky.” I couldn’t even wash my own clothes. household cleaning also had to be done on Sunday. She would complain that we treated her like a servant. Gio would spend his Sunday cleaning and always took the trash out during the week without being asked. 

Once she came in to me doing dishes, seemed grateful. I went to watch a movie with Gio in our room, came out for snacks. My clean dishes were back in the sink. “They still had spots on them” they did not as I knew she’d look for a reason to get upset. Gio had heard the comment, “you always say we don’t help out but when we do if it’s not done exactly your way or when you want it you complain.” “it’s my house it should be done how I want and when I want to done.” This “it’s my house” continued for the rest of our time there. 

She had the master bedroom and chose to sleep on the couch. We had to go through the living room to get through the bathroom, at night this was a problem if we woke her up. She refused to switch us bedrooms stating she needed her own space. I worked as a waitress in the mornings and Sundays because she fought every chance for either business to grow. “I don’t want to pay more in taxes”.“what if he messes up? As the owner I’m liable.” This led me into missing dinner on Sunday, was at work til 9pm. I brought home my own dinner and a snack for Gio, yes I checked she never wanted anything “it’s too salty”. 

opening and closing the togo boxes was too much for her one night. he started taking food out of the boxes to microwave. I came out to “do you guys have to open and shut those boxes 50 times? Man I can’t even sleep in my house.” Gio went into explaining the situation of me being at work all day and deserving a warm meal. “I don’t care you’re both so noisy at night and always walking through the living room I can’t sleep.” 

He reminded her you have a bedroom with a bathroom, “if you don’t like your bed get rid of it put a couch and tv in there.” She proceeds to yell in their native language. He tells her “I’m not doing this with you anymore. It’s your house, you have made that clear. We’ll get our own place.” “You dont have the money And I’m not paying for it.” “If I’m not spending half the day occasionally landscaping for you then I can find an actual part time job that gives me steady hours.” “You won’t get hired anywhere and you won’t like working for other people if you do.” “It’d be better than this and maybe we’d get along as a family.” 

Whole conversation he’s closing the togo boxes, handing me them and plates, 
 he unplugs the microwave picks it up and nods towards his bedroom. Thus began the home search. 

It took weeks of figuring out our budget for a place since she refused to hand over his business or tell us exact how much money was being made. “That makes you think moneys being made, I’m not even giving myself a paycheck.” I told him okay let’s base this off my checks, the waitressing and the cash from the after school care. Worse case the plasma clinic always wanted donors to make up the difference. We could have easily gotten an apartment especially with my savings from Covid. 

During the lockdown I didn’t buy anything other than foo, the restaurant had to sign us up for relief aide. Since I wasn’t paying her rent cuz “family doesn’t do that” I had a good amount saved. he wanted to help, I told him good luck. They fought over moving out. “It’s too much money”, “you won’t be able to afford rent and food”, and “I don’t want to be alone.” His answers was simple “you and I fight daily. You don’t get along with OP. Something has to change, since it’s not going to be your attitude it’s got to be our living arrangement.” “What do you expect me to do not live in my house?!” 

“That’s the problem it’s your house, not ours yours. If we want to make chicken nuggets in the oven at 2am we should be allowed too. If we want to wash clothes mid week we should be allowed too. We need our space as much as you need yours. you can help us find a place or we are going with the cheapest place possible to make sure we got money to cover everything.” She finally relented, the only benefit to having her controling finances was his credit score. Talking drive a new car off the dealership lot  just by signing paperwork. then the issues no renters history because she didn’t charge rent and no utilities in his name. 

Loans and everything else the bank said was great but wouldn’t give him a mortgage on a house. Why a mortgage on a house vs an apartment you ask. she convinced him rather pay the bank than a landlord that could kick you out for no reason. Our state didn’t have great renters rights. I told him since no bank would let us mortgage an apartment was our only option. He said we could always have the house in his mom’s name and us pay her. 

I told him if we do that she’ll hang it over our heads we are still living in her house, she’d find away to put the bills in her name, she’d never get a lease agreement written, and she’ll never sign the house over. He said that happens we’ll find some way to cut ties. Someone get me a medal cuz I called it! We moved in October 2021. The house needed “minor repairs” but we finally had our own space.  

I wasn’t allowed to paint one bathroom as she had to bring in a plumber to finish the shower and an electrician cuz if you plugged anything in the lights dimmed and flickered. Those guys never got hired. We got some water damage, didn’t hire anyone to fix the roof, I don’t call laying down fresh shingles fixing the roof until we had a move out date for the cross country move. 

TW February 2022 we found out we were pregnant, I was super happy to not be living with her. something in me screamed something was wrong. I told Gio how I felt, asked if we could just keep this to his mom and my parents as I didn’t want to tell people incase. He agreed I told him he had better stay on his mom. We told our parents on Saturday, Monday evening I caught her telling parents when they commented I looked tired. 

“Remember we don’t want to tell a lot of people especially since we know nothing yet.” “I know I know I just get excited.” I was excited, Gio was excited, did she really think we didn’t want to tell people. everyone knew because she told them before we had our first doctor’s appointment. We went to the doctors appointment and didn’t get good news, they said there’s a small chance they caught us early and baby was still developing but I knew we had miscarried. 

Gave it a week and they confirmed it. My body refused to give up the fetal tissue to the point I had to have a surgery. we grieved, I took a week off work because I just couldn’t be around the kids. I came back and she hadn’t said anything to anyone. Everyone assumed I was having morning sickness, needed time to adjust. 

“hey mommy how we feeling?” Conversations kept happening, end of the day I locked myself in the bathroom to cry before we went home. Bathroom was right next to the office. Bella “what’s the matter with her? I had miscarriages, you’re the only baby I brou

ght to term.” I walked out of the bathroom. “Did you have someone telling people you were pregnant? Even though you asked that person not too. You took the joy of me getting to share our news. And replaced it with pain of having to tell them no. You had a week, I know people probably came to ask how I was doing since I wasn’t here. You can tell them the good news but left me to tell them the bad. I’m not coming in the rest of the week so you can tell everybody you talked to the news.” 

Grabbed my stuff went out the door without waiting for a response. Yes I stayed home that week. Yes Gio supported me and told people when they asked him. No she didn’t tell anyone the bad news. I ignored her presence, civil when we had to interact. 

This was til December 2022 when we found out we were pregnant again. I told Gio let him have a few hours to enjoy the feeling then asked what we’d do about his mom. Cuz i didn’t want to have to go through that again. He said we’d wait til to see when the scheduled us for an appointment first. Appointment being a month out and the morning sickness already hitting we had no choice. We agreed I go to work when I felt up to it, I took leave from the restaurant. 

Got diagnosed with extreme morning sickness and a health baby at the appointment. Gio and I still asked everyone to please let us be the ones to share the news. My parents not a problem, Bella she “might have told a few of the more concerned parents”. I’ll admit I got to tell a lot more people this time. But she still broke a boundary I was just keep it civil. 

Now we always closed for spring break, Gio was trying for a big revamp especially with a baby on the way. He had a cat and everyone will tell you pregnant ladies can’t clean the litter. Bella came over daily there was no how you feeling. I already knew what baby shower theme I wanted, was diying decor. I set out my projects hoping she’d ask, nope didn’t say anything. 

It was like she was ignoring our pregnancy. She waited til the last day, when she caught me and mom coming back from grocery shopping to ask if I needed anything. Told my mom “baby comes I’ll get a part time job just to make sure they are taken care of.” Bella swears she never said this. what happened was the straw that set me in permanent civil mode, as Gio was fine being his version of LC but can’t bring himself to go full NC. 

Day of the anatomy ultrasound, got in there tech asked and we wanted to know. It’s a boy! My dad was at the ranch, so he got a text. My mom napping after a 12 hour shift so text. Bella knew when the appointment was, roughly when we’d be done. He asked if he could call since she wasn’t a big texter, I told him to go ahead. 

This B “I’m picking out plants with a customer. I’ll call you back” and hangs up. Even I wasn’t expecting that, Gio was devastated. We went to go get milkshakes our tradition after appointments. I asked him what he wanted to do…he said “she can call me when she cares.” She had ruined the moment for us, we got home and she called him…he was outside talking with her in the native language for hours. When he was done we just cuddled on the couch. 

To the baby shower, I went with a cafe theme “table for three” cuz we had Italian for our first date. we had a sandwiches, pasta bar, Italian desserts, grape juice for wine, ect. 

We agreed to have it at the after school care center in our common room. Since we were doing it on a Saturday, I showed up on Friday did crafts with the kids and decorate. Mil asked “are you sure you want to do this? You cant honestly be expecting a lot of people.” I was pissed because no matter the crowd I wanted to celebrate. I worked hard on the event for us I was doing it. 

“I sent out texts, calls, and a Facebook event. According to just Facebook we had 30 people say they’d come and another ten say maybe. That’s not including my family and people that don’t have facebook. I organized it so the kids could play games while the adults chatted. Food is going to be buffet style. made sure everybody know they can pop in, say hi, then go about their day.” 

She stared at me and finially said “it just seems like a way for you to get free baby stuff and that just doesn’t seem right to me.” before he could say anything the words came out of my mouth “they say it takes a village raise a child. Sometimes the most supportive members aren’t the ones related to you.” 

she had ignored our pregnancy, ignored our baby updates, and now wanted us to cancel the shower so she didn’t have to deal with people. Gio ask earlier what she wanted us to tell people when she wasn’t there. She really didn’t want to come. I’m not saying throw money at us cuz we are having a baby, but at least acknowledge the updates. 

Of course my words hit a cord, “what time does it start tomorrow?” “11am a lot of people said they’d be in when we get started. We will be coming early to finish set up.” With that she left. As soon as the door shut behind her I turned to Gio. “If she causes a scene tomorrow, I will tell her to leave.” “She’s got two strikes that I’ll damage control then throw her out myself.” He was also upset knowing how much work I had. 

everyone shows up at 11am minus her, she walks in at 11:15 sour look on her face seeing people. slams the office door, Gio nods. I knew the angry hushed tones. he left the office and for an hour she behaved herself. It came time for gifts, we sat and she had to put herself right next to Gio. my mom was snapping away at pictures. When he pointed out if she stayed there she’d be in pictures she bolted. We got maybe three pictures of her total. Btw if you’re wondering about her gift there wasn’t one. 

Gifts done, kids playing games, people snacking, we wanted one family photo. Bella ran to the office to get her camera. 10 years, I have only ever seen 5 pictures ever taken with this camera. She insisted on taking the photo vs being in it. One of the moms even said she’d take the picture with that camera and my phone. 

Gio “it’ll be really hard to explain to your grandson one day why you aren’t in this picture.” Tone read get in the picture or leave. She got in the picture again said “no one wants to see a fat ugly broad.” Guests left, food packed up, I wanted to sit for a second before we took down decor. She started a cleaning rampage. 

“If you give me a second I’ll tell you want needs to be packed away and what can be trashed.” “Oh let’s just take it down go home and sort it later.” “Because I’m the one that has to sort it and honestly I don’t want to do that. Trash can here works just fine.” She scoffed and kept going, “mom enough. It’s not being helpful it’s creating more work. If you want to leave, leave we handle it and I’ll come clean tomorrow.” “If I help it’ll go faster and we can clean together today and you can unpack it all tomorrow.” 

I was done got up started packing what I wanted to keep. “The rest goes in the trash,” she looked at me like I was crazy. “You’re trashing all this? But you worked so hard on it.” “I did work hard on it but it’s served its purpose and since we are having a baby we don’t have room for everything anymore.” 

This B proceeds to grab a bag and start collecting things she wanted to keep. I sat back down Gio “imma load the car. If you want to go anywhere or pick up anything please let me know.” I kept my eyes on his mother, “I’m good for the day some people just can’t help themselves and ruin my mood.” Nightly phone call between him and Bella that night was again outside in their native language. 

Onto the delivery, we told my mom. She was actually on her way to sit with me while gio landscaped with Bella. He called and told her, “I’ll work and be there after a shower, labor is a long process.” Getting to the hospital my mom called everyone else. Gio more worried about me than what his mom said developing a she’ll get here when she gets here attitude. I labored for five hours. 

she still hadn’t shown up according to my mom. Everyone else was there, even some friends were there in the waiting room. Once there again she was pissed she wasn’t the first one. Doubling down when she heard I had just delivered, it being the golden hour I told the nurses no one is allowed in. End of the golden hour, Gio went to ask friends to come back tomorrow they all obliged. 

Family was allowed in my parents over 
joyed, my grandmother tears. Bella wouldn’t hold baby boy, “I’m all awkward in these situations.” My brain went no crap, out loud I managed not to comment. My dad and grandma left. My mom went to get us dinner. Bella stayed baby boy holding her finger in his crib. She asked when he was going to the nursery, we told her he’s not. 
He’s not leaving this room. 

Nurses came in, she refused to break away from baby. And started talking to the nurses about time in the nursery, vaccines, and circumsision. Things Gio and I had already discussed and talked about with the staff. I looked at Gio it was obvious I wanted her to shut up. But he couldn’t get her to. 

Eventually I looked at a nurse what looked like she was over it too. I nodded she came over, “can I have my baby please?” She looked way too happy to take baby from crib and give him to me. Bella left shortly after, called Gio that night I was so proud to hear “mom we had already talked about all that together and with the staff. If cared to talk about our decisions regarding our son before his birth you should have asked.” 

Next year August 2022-2023 is really easy to condense for you. Bella came over to our house twice in the first two months. Both times less than 30 minutes because baby was asleep. Eventually guilted Gio “it’s a long drive” wasn’t even 20 minutes, “he’s always asleep” he’s a newborn, and “I feel awkward.” I wanted the complaints to stop “if you want to take him over that’s fine but it won’t change anything. She’ll still complain and probably not even hold him.” 

we went dinner and a quick movie. She had dinner ready, hated the fact Gio ate first. I had him eat first so they could have playtime and I could eat in peace. She chose to sit at the table watching Gio hold baby while I ate. Went to go watch a movie she wanted to watch something new, I pointed out if he’s up and fussy no one’s going to be able to catch anything. we settled for something we had watched before. 

I gave baby his bottle, after I offered for her to feed him she said no, then once he started getting sleepy decided she wanted to hold him. She held him for about 30 minutes as he slept. Then he woke up was immediately back to me, no attempt to soothe him herself. We did this twice, each time a week later it was back to complaining about not seeing baby and wanting us to stay longer. 

One day Gio wanted to give me a rest day, he’d do all the baby duties and I could just relax. He quickly realized just how much work went into caring for a baby. We talked about it later that day “yeah you didn’t even have to pack the diaper bag, prep the bottle, get him dressed, get yourself ready none of that for when we go to your moms.” 

He realized then she should be coming to us if she wanted to see baby. She refused, cancelled and tried getting us to come over last minute. I didn’t work at the after school care anymore cuz the kids wanted to treat him more as a baby doll than an actual baby. This continued til baby was 6 months old, that was the next trip to her house. 

She didn’t hold him, didn’t feed him, just like the pregnancy basically ignored. I sent pictures/videos of milestones and just happy baby moments “oh how cute” “he’s growing so fast” “I wish I could see this in person” or just a basic emoji was the response. No checking in how I was doing, no Christmas gift for baby, but guilt tripping that she didn’t get to see baby. 

Baby’s birthday, one party at our house for family and another at a restaurant to catch up with friends. Our house she took Gios time by talking in hushed tones in the corner and standing in the way. He almost missed the smash cake photos and presents cuz of her. I had scheduled party times to be right between naps. She wasn’t invited to the restaurant but somehow came anyway. 

We were opening gifts, she came running up “is this a scam?!” Shoving her phone in gios face, during cake she decided to go play the arcade game in the corner. I told him I’m done she’s ruined yet another event. “I’m change him and then we’ll have to go it’s almost nap time.” 

the after school care building was leased the roof started leaking before baby’s birthday. Leaking got so bad she called the landlord. Come to find out he’d let the insurance on the building lapse and she never had any on anything but the business. Given that insurance couldn’t be involved they agreed to get it fixed out of pocket. Landlord had been a roofer back in the day. 

Well he went to work, didn’t put any weather proofing down, a section of the ceiling collapsed in after a rain storm. Lucky it was before kids came in and left that room locked. It took them six months to fix the roof with no leaks, no gaps, no accidental skylights. During this entire time the business was hemorrhaging money. 

We, Gio and I were stressed, she seemed bothered but not overly worried. Gio couldn’t watch baby so I could work because he was working morning and afternoon with her landscaping, coming home for lunch, and then leaving to go teach in the evening. He had a friend that moved out of state, cross country actually to be around family. 

The friend offered Gio a job, his business had three smaller rooms and a common area they didn’t need. Figured with the roof caving in, no one offering after school care in his area, they could combine forces. This offered burned in gios pocket for a bit. he didn’t like the idea of moving from coast to coast just cuz of a landlord that couldn’t get the roof fixed, a business that was failing, and his mom fighting him on every chance to improve the business. 

Said it wasn’t fair to me, my folks, or baby. My folks would never get on a plane, it’d take them a few extra days drive due to my dad’s health to visit, and they’d have to make sure my mom had enough vacation days. basically zero chance of them ever visiting. I know what you’re thinking just pick up more landscaping customers. 

Bella refused on grounds again she was the business owner and didn’t want to be liable if he made mistakes. Gio brought up getting his own LLC and customers, working morning/afternoons on days she didn’t, paying her “rent” on her tools and consulting fees as needed. She told him “you’ll be competing with long standing businesses with bigger work crews so more availability for customers.” He asked if she’d let him take over her last three customers “when they are done I’m done and what I get from them is barely enough to keep my house going.” 

All that being said it was the move or find something else completely. “better the devil you know” he knows how to run, build, and operate an after school program. Even better without Bella standing in the way. baby boy turned one and we decide to move. My folks were pissed but said they understood…yeah no they didn’t understand they are currently LC minus unless I send pictures/videos of the baby. everyone turned toxic. 

Gio went out to see before we moved the whole family. Facility was perfect for what we needed. There were kids that would join the program when it started. Lease agreement Gio could be added too. His friend was even willing to let us run the program three months rent free to make sure we were good. Gio gave me the okay I started downsizing, donating, packing with a toddler and no steady help. I didn’t feel great one day and recognized how I felt. Took the test, I was pregnant. 

We always said we wanted two kids, close in age so they could bond and do things together. Originally plan was to wait til our first was 2, well our first turns 2 years old 2 months after his sibling is born. This didn’t make anyone feel better about the move. My folks more upset and uncomfortable. Bella came to take care of the cat litter and “I’m so busy” never stayed to watch baby boy so I could pack or shower, never asked about cravings or if I needed anything. 

My mom came over her days off minimum hour so I could shower and us eat. Max two hours so we could eat and I could pack a little.  This cycle continued for the three months. All with getting diagnosed with extreme morning sickness to the point I lost ten pounds.  I didn’t see Gio at all my first trimester minus daily video chats. Now we decided to drive taking the important belongings, baby stuff, and putting the rest in storage. 

We only had the one car, and Gio had drove it out to the other coast so he didn’t have to rent. He thought our support system would do its job. I had minimal support. my grandmother, she was the rockstar. Twice a week for five hour stints she’d come baby sit the toddler so I could pack. Bella was dropping off donations and taking stuff to our storage unit. Gio had her put on the lease for the storage unit so she could have access to it. Plan was to transfer her the monthly fees and shipping costs. 

Gio had found out one of the former after school families was planning a trip to the same city we were moving to. Brought this up, this is where stuff went sideways. She brought up paying the dad to drive the Uhaul and us fly. She’d keep our cat, didn’t like us paying pet fees plus a pet and two kids in an apartment. Saying “this would be so much easier since OP is pregnant and baby boy won’t have to sit in this car seat the whole time.” 

I told Gio I’d still rather us drive so I can hurl was needed, sleep, bring our cat, and keep baby boy away from airport germs. If anything still pay that dad to drive the Uhaul and us rent an suv to take everything in one go. He liked this idea. looking at all the costs Bella pushed her idea. I didn’t like this idea. Eventually between doing everything, I told Gio I’m out I’m done so long as I’m with you where I’m actually heard I don’t give a poop. we ended up flying. 

Bella, the dad, and the next door neighbors loaded the Uhaul. I put the toddler in his play pen and slid boxes towards the door. Daily life stuff first, apparently this took all the room. Bella wouldn’t allow me out the door to look and see if I had any boxes that could fit. Baby items, home decor, knick knacks, ect left behind for her to take to the storage unit later. “There’s no room left. You’ll have to visit to get the rest and the cat or I’ll ship it to you.” 

Moving truck leaves giving me a few days more with my folks and to label storage unit boxes. Gio came in on an evening flight. Picked up me, baby boy, and the cat up to stay the night at his mom’s. We left the next morning via plane. We arrived and got to our apartment a hours before the moving truck. Upon the moving truck getting there, opening the moving truck we found out it was only half full. 

We had plenty of room for the baby stuff, Gio and I were pissed but we aren’t due til May. It was November. The dad said, he thought it was odd we didn’t use every last bit of space but Bella told him that was everything we were taking. I immediately looked at Gio he told me he’d handle it. All the boxes brought in, toddler in play pen I started talking things out of boxes. 

Bella called him shortly after, her response to why there was still room on the truck…”well you said you were coming back for Christmas I thought you’d pick up the rest and the cat then” “I said we’d try, and that just means we’d have to fly in, get a rental, and drive across country like we originally had planned vs flying in and out. The visits home flying between locations would have made more sense. I knew we should have stuck to our plan of driving to get everything else here.” “Well you got the important stuff,” she snapped.

 “Really? What about the baby stuff?” “Op didn’t give that to us to put on the truck.” “Mom I’m calling bs. You told him that’s all we are taking. You told her there was no room left. So we literally have nothing for baby number two here.” “Well then I’ll ship it to you and you can grab the cat when you visit.” 

It’s march 2025 and let me tell you what we have gotten shipped to us. 3 care packages of food. 2 boxes of broken decor because she didn’t bubble wrap the items, and here’s where I lose my cool. I had a few plastic bags last minute donations, Bella went through them to pull out toys our first born doesn’t/didnt/never wanted to play with and sent those instead of stuff in storage. 

I told Gio how sad I am to know we now have to rebuild everything for baby number two. Especially since baby wasn’t shy about showing us the fact he’s a dude. We still had the infant car seat, the bath tub, bottles, blankets, bibs, play gym, toys clothes, everything. I won’t get pictures of our boys in the same outfits (most of which were hand me downs, which I love because someone held onto them and loved them just for our child to end up with them), playing with the same toys. 

We always said two babies which is why we kept everything.   Last I heard from her “go through the storage unit when the weather is good.” Aka it’s not a worry of hers. So she’ll get to it when she ready. Meaning never. ",0,11,1743024630.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jkna5q/my_mil_is_holding_our_baby_stuff_hostage_and/

So I brought my boyfriend over a couple times this month while my mom are traveling and she kinda let him but said its better she doesnt know he slept here any more time but he did. She says its too soon to him come here but my brother who is 2 years older than me recived a right message from her that when he frist brought his girlfriend here either he would marry her and she would live here or he moved out for it. SO THATS HOW A GIRL THAT I'VE NEVER MEET IN MY HOLE LIFE JUST COME LIVE WITH US. (He was talking to her for 2 months and I just saw her one time before that, how nice isn't)

My mom think is wrong just sleep with your gf or bf but it's okay if this unknow person live here. My mom dated my ex stepfather for 10 years without marry him and he also didn't lived here, and right now she's in her boyfriend house ?? BUT IF I BROUGHT A MAN HERE AND MY FAMILY STARTS TALKING ABOUT I AM BEING A F SLUT and she want me get out the house  to live with him simple as that. By the way I am very educated and never said shit in front of anyone or did something dirt.

Also couple years ago my uncle come live with us and he is a addict to crack and I multiples times smash a black target pill for him to sleep till the night when there was adults in the house so he doesn't do shit with me or my little cousin. My mom is a very tough woman she raised me and my brother alone and when we were in this situation she went for it and fight a lot to put him in a recovery clinic but what I can't understand is why when it comes to me she so mean, she even gave half of our house for my brother so he can live with hes now wife, they had a baby and my mom wants my to care for ''our little angel'' (I truly love her but not so much her parents)  but so hes wife can work (from home) but when I am with her I can't help but feel a bit angry as  my brother never have pacience to be with her so everyone else has to.

Right now I am changing my mind I am becoming my old self version again that do things right, I stop smoking, Improved even more my way of talking and my behaviors, stared college and will break with my boyfriend because he really isn't a nice guy after all. But this whole situation makes me so mad that my mom can't see that I followed exactly she pattern or she is mad because a make it clear the worst part of her but I cant help but feeling like shit knowing she will never admit that she also fuckep up and when she got home I problably am gonna be kicked out as I gave reasons when let him come over. She really a dick to me when it comes to my choices and that have reason for that and I am the black sheep, never will understand how betrayed I was when our house was over and over with people I've never get confortable living with. I'am 23 years now I know I've to get out anyway. thanks for anyone who read till here I needed to vent a little",1,0,1743012576.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jkif1g/either_i_am_a_asshole_or_my_family/

Tw. Child abuse

Hi sorry for the long back story, but I am more or less typing this out to clear my thoughts out and try and come to a decision on something that has been bugging me most of my life.

I am currently NC with my (35f) Father (56M) I haven't had any sort of relationship with him for almost 10 years. 
He was 21 when I was born and married to my narcissist of a mother. (Shotgun wedding thanks to being pregnant with me) They had another daughter 3 years later (my sister who I am NC with and she is NC with our father) They ended up divorcing after some very miserable years of constant screaming, abuse allegations and my father getting drunk at his work Christmas party and calling her a fat bitch in front of everyone just before my 7th birthday. The separation and divorce were hell. He acted like any immature guy in their 20s slept around, had different girlfriends in and out of the house and was having a great time except for my NM (narcissistic mother) trying to make life as difficult as possible, denying him access to us, demanding the house etc. For a couple of years, he had fortnightly weekend visits with us. When he did not have a girlfriend in the picture he was a great dad, camping trips, always outside doing something with us, playing, bike riding etc etc etc.  BUT when there was someone he was seeing that would completely flip and feel fake. Initially, he would sort of put us on display, his whole demeanour would change and he would make a huge effort with their children and give them all of our toys etc while we were at our mothers. I remember coming over one time to find my entire room had been given to a girlfriend's daughter. She was wearing my clothes and had destroyed some of the toys I had gotten for Christmas and my Birthday, and I was told to just get over it. Then the Girlfriends would slowly start treating me like crap, at first when he wasn’t around, but slowly in front of my dad and he just went along with it no matter how ridiculous and would either get mad along with them or not say a word in my defence.

He would also do things like drastically favour my younger sister. Ie she would get all brand new toys and a big Birthday party every year and I would be lucky if I got something second-hand from a garage sale that he found on the way home from picking us up. Same with clothing, days out etc. She would always get what she asked for and I was told No.

Around the start of the year I turned 9, My NM was sick of us seeing him. They both put me in the middle of their divorce. Telling me horrible things about the other, My Nm demanded that I stop seeing him, and He kept telling me that I could come and live with him full-time and not have to deal with my mother's abuse anymore. I distinctly remember him telling me to just go inside after visitation, let my mother know that I wanted to stay with him from now on and then come back out and he would be waiting and we would go home. I did this, only to look out of the window and see that he had left. I was out the front crying for a good hour waiting for my dad to come back. After that, my trust was gone. I gradually started refusing to go and after a very nasty court battle, He gave up. From 10 onwards I did not see him.

After this, my mother's abuse drastically escalated… We were homeschooled and had no one in our corner to tell. I started attending school at 12 when the education department told her that we were too far behind and that I had to go to mainstream school. I later found out that she had told the entire family it was because she could no longer tolerate my behaviour. At 14 she tried to have me placed in a children's psychiatric ward to “fix me”. Because I was plotting my escape for when I turned 15 (with help from my year co-ordinator after they had a run-in and she sat me down and asked to know what on earth was going on at home) and I had started to fight back when she started either hitting or screaming at me ( a daily occurrence in her house) later on I found out this was after nm had tried to get me expelled from school and or sent to Juvy “for abusing her” and the police had declined to intervene.

So after two weeks of back and forth trying to decide what to do with me as after the 3-day hold was up they had said that I didn't need treatment, rather that I lived in a toxic home environment and my mother and I needed some serious family counselling. At 14 nearly 15, I was placed in temporary foster care for 9 months.  Family therapy did not work as my NM refused to participate saying they needed to just fix me. The therapist then fully supported me in my decision not to return home.  After the temporary orders had expired my Foster mother allowed me to live with her for a short time until a place became available in a youth homeless shelter. I was declared independent by family services, helped to get onto social security and that was it, I was on my own.

A month or so after this happened I received a call from my social worker. My dad had recieved a letter saying that he was no longer Liable for my portion of the child support he had been paying to my mother (surprise surprise she had been claiming money for my care the entire time I was in foster care )  He had called them freaking out wondering what had happened to me. I permitted them to give him my contact details and shortly after my Nanna called me. She told me all the things I wanted to hear, how they had missed me so much and always knew I would return to them. I agreed to meet them all the next weekend and go from there.

I met them and things seemed great. My dad appeared to have changed and grown up a lot in those five years I hadn't seen him, He was now with a partner and they were expecting a baby together in a few months and I had a stepbrother. I gradually started spending most weekends at my dad's house while still living in my independent little flat through the youth shelter.  We had lots of fun during these months, BBQs, family camping trips and big Fillipeano parties (my new stepmother was from the Philippines) things were great and I was so happy to finally be a part of a family that cared about me and treated me so well. I was promised all sorts like trips overseas and help to buy my own house and car when the time came etc etc. 

After my little brother was born things seemed good, I loved him with my whole heart and loved looking after him and spending time with him, but things between my dad and stepmother started to go downhill. She stopped attending so many events with him, I started hearing him bitching about her to friends etc etc.  They went to the Philippines for a month (now no mention of me coming along) and soon after they got back, her brother was killed brutally and shockingly. She shut down and was grieving and my dad was very nonchalant about the whole thing. I don't know what happened between them after this, but His gossipy neighbour kept telling me they were screaming and fighting all the time and had the cops called on them, He was accusing her of cheating and I know he was cheating on her. She started calling me asking where he was etc and I had no idea and asked to please not be involved as it had nothing to do with me.

Just before things really hit the fan, they had offered me to move into one of their investment properties. I had originally declined because my boyfriend and I had a house, but they kept insisting, Saying that there were better job opportunities in their country town, that they would reduce the rent for me and I could do what I wanted within reason with the house. We ended up agreeing and moving in with the verbal agreement that we would pay $180pw and Dad an extra $30 because apparently, the bank wouldn't let them go under $210 a week payment or something. Being barely 18 at the time I trusted them and let it go. We faithfully paid the $180 every week and were living there when they started fighting constantly. So many times they would leave my then 2 yo brother with me for days and weeks at a time and I couldn't reach either of them, pick up times were ignored, and texts were unanswered, all while being a teenager and trying to work and take care of a gorgeous little boy who probably knew way too much of what was going on. Did I mention this place was a total dump too? Things falling apart, disgusting carpet, fixtures in the laundry that electrocuted you when you touched them, no heating, barely any AC, and eventually no oven for 2 years. Every time I asked for something to be fixed I was met with, Oh yes I will get onto that, or I am really busy for the next few weeks can you just do it?  As things got messier and messier between them and they eventually broke up, the excuse changed to “Oh I do not want to fix it if she is going to get the house” He also started saying that our rent was late and could we please just give it to him and he would transfer the whole amount rather than having to go into the bank every week. (Yes I know massive red flag, but I was a dumb ass teenager and believed him) Months of this went by and he met a real crazy Lady that he ended up moving into his house.  She was NUTS from the get-go. Opened and threw out my Birthday present from my Nanna because she didn't like it, full-on telling me all about my Dads sex life 🤮 despite me saying I was uncomfortable with this, Making my brother miserable,  constantly calling me at all hours of the day and night convinced my dad was cheating or because they had a fight. (I don't know how she got my number, I guess from his phone but I never gave it to her) Babbling Crazy stuff about how I needed to forgive my dad and move on, then banning him from seeing us, or dropping my Brother off with me and lying about going out with friends (His friend's wife was talking to me a few weeks later about how it was a shame we were all sick that day and couldn't attend)  Trying to Convince everyone she was a supermodel. BATSHIT CRAZY… 
Anyway while dealing with all of this we recieved a knock on the door from the Bank with a foreclosure notice. Turns out my father and his ex had not been paying the mortgages on any of their properties while they were splitting up! I had enough by this point and did something dumb and stopped paying rent, and started to look for somewhere else. Eventually, my ex-stepmother accessed her super and managed to save the houses, She then Hired a real estate agent and got the house we were living in their settlement. She also served a notice that our rent would be increasing and backdated it 90 days so it was effective immediately! Turned out she was trying to claim we owed rent right from the time we moved in and that we owed 3 years' worth of the $30 my dad was supposed to be putting in, then all the time that he hadn’t put it in when I gave it to him in cash. Luckily I had some receipts and I was able to argue to the real estate agent that we had reported the oven not working and that it had been 2 years of an essential item not working so I managed to negotiate a lot of the extra claims away. I found a new house for rent a few weeks later and moved.  We were told that because we still owed money no matter what we were not getting our bond back. I was really angry by this point and didn't bother to clean a thing. We left and never heard from Ex-Step again.

After all this, there were a few more instances of minor disagreements with my Dad
And a few that showed me just how selfish he was. 

My Brother came to visit Dad one day and had Welts all over him. He had been blamed for a hole in the wall at his mother's house (he claimed his brother did it, not him) His mother had belted him (buckle end) for lying. He was 6. I begged my Dad not to send him back. Very indifferently he replied that he had to work. I said I don't care, Protect your son from this, I will change my shift (I was part-time at this stage barely making enough to survive). And work around it so he doesn't have to go back to that. He still sent him home and nothing ever amounted to it but a warning from CPS when it finally was reported weeks later. (I said I was going to report her but he said he wanted to speak with a lawyer first)

He rented out another house to my partner's sister and left her without hot water and other issues for days on end until after a year she had enough and moved.  I of course was used as a go-between because he couldn't talk to her like an adult.

Would constantly leave my brother alone in the house. I found out they even did this as a newborn baby when he and his ex worked on the afternoon/night shift 5 minutes from their house, they would leave him alone during changeovers and this progressed into leaving him in the house alone at 4 or 5 to run to the store. One time when he was around 5 I dropped in to ask my dad something. My brother said he was at the shops and had been gone a while. I waited an hour and a half with him until our father returned. He said he was only gone 5 minutes when I said that wasn't ok.

Would pressure me into cancelling work or plans to watch my brother. If I said I was busy or no, He would leave him alone or with unsafe people.

Started nitpicking about my weight and making myself feel a bit crapy about it (did this to my brother as well) trying to put us on diets, exercise plans etc and making my then 7yo brother throw away his easter eggs.

Still treated my sister like gold, she would only see him on HER birthday or before Christmas, and he would buy her beautiful thoughtful presents every year. Me who was watching his son and helping him to renovate most of my spare time? Oh sorry, I am a bit broke and can't afford anything for you.

Would book holidays that I couldn't afford, either say he would pay so I could come along or say it was a price much lower than it was, only for me to drive out to wherever and discover that I had ALOTT more to pay than originally mentioned or full on my share, that I would not have agreed to come along if I had known about having to pay. 

Would constantly complain he was broke. He had a good salary, His house was almost paid off after he broke up with his ex, and his other 2 properties were making more than the mortgage payments on them. I saw the bank statement once. His total Mortgage costs that he had to pay were $60 A MONTH. He was giving lifts to everyone to work and making $50 a week on petrol, the women he worked with often brought him meals to share so he rarely had to cook or buy groceries (got to love Filipeano mother hens.) I on the other hand was supporting my spouse and myself on minimum part-time work, paying rent and often food for my brother most weekends and my BIL who was having issues at home.

Always puts his girlfriends and his needs and wants above his kids.

Started dumping things like an old car that he wanted to fix and take to his friend's property in our yard because he did not want his yard to look messy, then when we asked him to move it said he was too busy and get my Partner or BIL to do it because it didn't matter if they got a fine or lost their licence. My BIL finally did do it because he was sick of it being in the yard and then my dad refused to drive him back home. BIL lost it at him and it..

There were also lots of little occasions I would catch him in lies or he would ask me to back him up or lie if someone asked me about something. I told him that I didn't want any part in this, didn't like being dishonest with people and I didn't even see the need for the lie most of the time.


Don’t get me wrong. I fucked up along the way too, there was the whole rent incident, and there were also times I was struggling and having car problems. He offered to loan me money and I did but I took a long time to pay it back. Another time he bought a car off of his friend. They wanted $3000 for it, honestly, I could have gotten a running car for $1000 at the time and been ok, but he insisted that if he was helping me out then it had to be this car. I agreed and paid some off and I was really struggling at the time so I was paying little bits and pieces and he said he would write it off as a gift for taxand not to worry about it. I was very grateful but I do still feel like I owe him that money.  I also accidentally left his sprinklers on overnight while watching his house while he was on vaccination and that would have been a pretty decent bill 😩. But we were still talking/ me watching my brother's terms after all of this.

I started to pull away after all of this and he got a new girlfriend from Indonesia. I was just exhausted with it all as well as dealing with my NM (I will eventually get to typing up that story) a depressed partner, my depression/ anxiety and a trove of other health issues. I got to see again just how he treated his kids when he had a new partner and it pissed me off. I was having a bit of a vent over email to my Nanna (I have since gone no contact with her as well over this and other toxic behaviour)
About how I didn't like how the new girlfriend treated my brother and how my father hadn't defended him when he was doing nothing wrong. I also said the same as I have above that he would disappear and be uncontactable when I had my brother in my care. (I am talking about not showing up at the time he said he would pick him up, then turning his phone off)
The very next day I got a text from my Dad, saying I needed to mind my own business, how dare I tell my Nanna that he was out Partying every night and Don't ever talk to him again!

I sent him the entire email thread. No where had I said he was out partying (maybe projection?) He did not reply.

I then messaged my Nanna and asked her what on earth she said to him. She flipped and was super nasty saying I needed to butt out of his life (um yeah I didn't want to be in most parts of the things that happened, I got dragged in most of the time against my wishes) and almost like bragging about what she had told him..
It was then I realised just how true the horrible stories about her had been. This on top of her just little nasty comments out of nowhere and seeing her in action turning on an old friend of hers, I told her I was done. And I haven't spoken to her since.

My Dad then ignored me every time he saw me around town.  He would say HI to my partner loudly and then not even look at me. I was angry too.  Like you want to play that game? My sister also messaged me that she had been invited to his wedding and was I going?. I said I hadn't been invited. She said she was going to decline because she did not have contact with him really and didn't know anyone there. 
2 days before the wedding, while I was at work, he was banging on my door and windows demanding I come out. My BIL eventually opened it and said I wasn't there (he knew what my regular work days were) and he said give this to her and handed him a wedding invitation.
He then texted me at work (before I had even seen the invite or known about any of this) You are invited to our wedding. I sent it back. No.

2 years went by and my partner kept telling me to talk to him. He had seen my dad around and told him we were planning on moving interstate. My dad said oh let's catch up for dinner. We went out to a restaurant a couple of days before we left. It was all small awkward talk. Nothing really got said. It was a pretend everything is ok dinner of mainly my partner and Dad talking. He gave me an awkward hug goodbye and that was it.

No contact again for over a year and we found out I was pregnant and having a son.
My Partner reached out to him saying that we were planning on being back in the state soon and that he was going to be a grandfather.
He replied that we will have to catch up for a BBQ. Nothing else, no reactions or congratulations. Nothing… my partner was a bit like wtf and left it.  It's important to note that my Aunt(Dad's sister ) was a friend on Facebook throughout this. So we believe she was feeding him information.
On the last day of our trip, we were sitting around at my inlaws when my partner got a message saying 
What time will you be here today? From my dad. 
 he replied today? What was planned for today? We are flying home in a couple of hours.
My dad wrote back. Oh. You can't even make time for us. Dont bother…
So we left confused about what that was all about.

A few months later my Son was born…. Again radio silence. My Aunt said congratulations on Facebook (she was also living 45 minutes away from me at this stage) but never reached out.
2 weeks later she put up a post of my dad's entire family having a reunion less than 30 minutes away from me in our state.  Dad was there and again radio silence.

2 years later we moved back to our home state and had our second son. This time not even my aunt said anything. 


My sons are now 6&4 especially my youngest is starting to ask questions about families and Grandmas/Grandpas. My partner recently ran into my ex-step-brother (my half-brother's elder brother) and they have been talking about contacting my brother for me which I would love now that he is an adult. The subject of my Dad has been coming up a lot too. My partner believes we should reach out to him, clear the air and move on.   Firstly I miss my dad, not all the crappy parts, but the good time dad when he had time for us. Secondly, even though he's kind of an irresponsible selfish person, I don't see him doing a lot of stuff out of maliciousness like some of my other family members, but rather cluelessness and emotional immaturity. And thirdly there is the fact that my kids don't really have any Grandparents. I am completely No contact with my abusive narcist mother, and also NC with my mother-in-law (she's a whole novel on her toxic behaviour) my partner occasionally takes them to see her but she has terminal cancer and honestly doesn't have a meaningful relationship with my kids anyway.  His dad died years ago. I think this is also why my partner is so willing to let the kids see my dad because, after the stuff he has been through with his family, it is nothing terrible as far as he is concerned


If you made it to the end YAY, thanks for your Time… what do I do with this mess??? Do I leave it alone knowing that I am not important enough for him to reach out to me? And knowing that he said never to talk to him again? Does he even remember texting me that 10 years ago? Do I write to him with clear boundaries asking to talk???? Do I let my kids meet this man knowing that at some point he is probably going to disappoint them as he has with me my entire life? I don't know what to do, my heart and my head are in two very different places and I feel like all the toxic people in my life have messed with my self-worth, boundaries and what a healthy familial relationship should look like. Any outside perspectives and advice are welcome. Thanks again.

1jjyjzo,Is it wrong I cut my older sister out of my life?,OkRun7294,"Hey everyone! I know this questions is a handful and it might come off really wrong but hopefully some insight can bring clarity. 

Me and my sister have always had a complicated relationship even when we were kids. As we got older…everything just got worse. By the time we were in high school, she made sure to belittle me and remind me of how ugly I was, how terrible my outfits were, how annoying I am, and how everything is my fault. She spoke to me my whole life with such disrespect and constantly yelling. 

A couple of years ago, I started to gain some confidence and started telling her NO. Or just giving her little to no reactions to her comments. One day, I was having a really bad day and the second I finally got home she was screaming at me because she couldn’t find her razor and swore I “stole” it. I just didn’t answer because I was so mentally exhausted. This led to her calling me every name in the book and me responding “are you done?” “Anything else?”. 

This would be the last time we spoke. She tried to talk to me a handful of times after but by this time, I had a boyfriend and a group of friends that really built up my confidence. I cut her off because I realized ignoring her and her eventually catching on and not speaking to me made me happier. It sucks to say but im way more comfortable with myself when she’s not around/in my life. It has been 3 years since and I moved out of the house 2 years ago and we still never exchanged words. Am I wrong for this? I couldn’t be another person in her life that allows her to speak to them that way and stick around with no apology. Unfortunately I ask this question because my family says I am the more mature one so I should suck it up and just speak to her again. What do you guys think?

1jjxq27,My brother struggles with mental illness and is getting in to guns. I need help avoiding something terrible happening in the near future.,JRose_Does_Westcoast,"I'm in a very complicated situation that I can't seem to find any solutions to. My brother is a 37 year old man who struggles with severe bipolar disorder. He has never held a job, struggles making and keeping friends, has never been in a serious relationship, and still lives with my 87 year old father. 

Recently my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer that has spread throughout his body. He has maybe a year or two to live at the most. He is actively pursuing treatment to keep the cancer at bay, but it doesn't look good. My dad has gotten all of his ducks in a row, regarding his last will and testament and his last wishes. He has decided to split his estate, including the house he lives in and owns, between me and my 4 siblings. We all have equals percentages of his estate, except for my brother who will get 20% more than the rest of us, because he has never been able to take care of himself and my dad feels he will need more resources to survive. We all agreed to this and are fine with it. 

My dad and brother have a codependent relationship. My brother has a safe place to live and doesn't have any bills or job but is very resentful that he ""has to live there"". He generally smokes weed all day and plays a lot of video games. He helps around the house at times and with errands and other things here and there. He is pretty much my dads only friend. I think my brother really is quite ashamed and angry that he can't take care of himself and has never been able to.  

My brother is also very unstable and has a terrible temper. He will snap often and scream and yell at my dad, telling him that he should be able to think his way out of having cancer and that he is weak and pathetic. My siblings and I have reported elder abuse, but they let us know that my dad would have to call them himself, since he is not developmentally disabled and is of sound mind. My dad will never do that. He worries all the time about my brother being homeless or hurting himself. The rest of us siblings don't go to the house much anymore because we don't feel safe being there. You never know what mood my brother will be in, and if he will berate and insult you or offer you a meal. 

The main thing I am worried about is that my brother recently got in to guns and shooting. He goes to shoot at a gun range and talks about guns all the time now.  He has also decided that he owns the house outright when my dad passes away. He has told us many times that even though the will and testament is very clear, he owns the house not us, and he won't ever let us take it away. He has threatened to kill himself and/or to defend the house by whatever means necessary to protect \*his\* house from getting sold or taken away. He doesn't care about the money (he stands to inherit something like $275,000 once we sell the house). He has told us that if he can't have the house and property, then nobody will have it. 

We are all at a loss. We worry that there are SO MANY red flags here, and that he has all of the makings of a family annihilator, and now has guns and is delusional much of the time. He has lucid weeks where he is kind and funny and like his old younger self, but then he will slip back in to his delusional, angry, sad, mean, depressive state. He refuses to take medication, doesn't believe in Western medicine, won't go to therapy, and doesn't trust anyone. 

Does anyone have any ideas for how to proceed? I don't want him to harm my dad or myself or my siblings or any of our children. At this point we are all scared of him. Once my dad passes away, I worry that in his grief he will become even more unstable and follow through with his plans to keep the house by any means necessary. I have these terrible visions of being murdered by my own brother and don't know what to do. He has said that the day my dad dies he plans to start a commune on the property and that we can't stop him. I can see this train wreck happening in the future, and don't know how to stop it.

1jjxn5r,How do I convince my mother of keeping her promise of helping me through college?,ConsistentPhrase5016,"Hi! I (20f) live with my mother, we’re going through a tough financial situation because my mother has a restaurant that was successful for a while but now is in debt because my mom decided to buy a little cabin in a mountain( that we never use because it’s very far away ) instead of paying off debts, due to said debts the bank repoed her car and she had to get into more debt to get it back, to make a long story short she’s owes 5 months of rent now and can pay it off if she sells her car but she doesn’t want to.

Now to get to the start of my issue, due to this I had to get a full time job while balancing uni to pay por my uni expenses (excluding the semesters payment), I make about 500 usd a month and I save 250 and use 250 for the houses WiFi, my cellphone, some groceries, and my social outings, I’m able to do this because I budget really well and take public transport from my house to uni. My mom also asks me for small amounts of money every now and then as a loan but she never pays it back but I don’t charge her for them because I understand she’s a single mother that’s just made some bad decisions.

Recently my uni has been bugging me to pay my tuition, we were supposed to pay it 2 months ago but the university is a bit flexible with payment times. But now, since there was no payment they have eliminated me as a student and I can’t attend classes anymore, I mentioned this to her since she promised that she was gonna support me all through college and she said that she would see what strings she could pull so she could pay that off.

Before I get to the next point I want to mention that my mother payed for my sister college until she got pregnant and dropped out , after that she proceeded to pay for her rent for about a year and regularly bought my nephews groceries and clothes. She also payed for multiples certifications for my sister like a nail , makeup and eyelash course for her to work on but my sister never made a business out of that at the end. For the record I always helped baby sit for her at least 2-3 times a week for about 4 hours each at my mother’s request.

Today I caught my mother and sister talking behind my back, my sister was urging my mother to not pay for my college tuition and to let me pay it for myself since I have a job now. The thing is that , If my mom made some lifestyle changes like eating out less or shopping less or stop visiting her boyfriend and flying out to other cities she would be able to make the monthly payments for my tuition, I on the other hand would have to dedicate 100%  of my salary for 4 months to pay for my tuition without including external costs like transportation and food. 

Also my grandmother payed for my last semester since my mom couldn’t make the payment. I would like to highlight that I’m a straight A student , I don’t cause any problems at home and help out with the restaurant when possible.

For this reason I would like advice to help convince my mother to keep her promise of helping me through school.",1,0,1742945096.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jjxn5r/how_do_i_convince_my_mother_of_keeping_her/
1jjsyro,I feel like I cannot trust my mom,VegetableWar8104,"To start off, I want to apologize for my poor choice of words. English isn't my native language.

Concerning the issue I have to face regarding my mom: my mom is the most dramatic person in my life.

I used to be a very anxious child when I was younger. Looking back, my mothers attitude definitely fed into it, because she too, like me, is a very nervous person at times. However, I don't want to blame her for it, but I still wish she would have at least tried to behave a bit more mature to calm me down. My desire for a man in my life (I'm a homosexual man with daddy issues) that takes care of me and helps me calm down when stressed or sad definitely steams from the lack of comfort in my childhood when I needed the guidance and reassurance of a grown-up, but instead only ever got to hear someone as nervous if not even more nervous than me break down. 

I'm 17 years of age now, and my mother still acts that same way. I've learned to think more clearly and calmly when stressed and not to rely as much on my moms words as before. Most of the times now I just roll my eyes and let her complain and yell histrionically. However, that dramatic nature of hers twists the truth very often, making it hard to know what a certain situation really looks like. 

Sometimes my mother will describe baggages  as unbelievably heavy to me and that no man is able to carry them (they may be a bit heavier to her than me, but they are still, humanly possible, very portable). Other times, she claims she'll arrive somewhere in about 2 minutes, but really needs about 15 minutes. 

I'm ill at the moment and my mother throws a constent tantrum about how dangerous my sickness is. It really isn't, and I keep on trying to explain to her that I'm feeling well and a lot better, but she won't listen to me at all.

She always assumes I'm taking drugs or doing something illegal out with my friends, even though I have never done anything of that sort.  I can't let anything happen to me, because she'll act like the worlds about to end. This is why I stopped telling her about certain things and started to lie. I cannot handle her anxiousness any longer. She twists the truth and I cannot believe her. She knows that she's lying, but she's addicted to speak in hyperbole.

I desire someone in my life as a guiding role that speaks the truth, that does not let their feelings consume them entirely, that can tell me the truth, the plain truth, not twist it, so it seems unbearable. I need someone to calm me. I know that my desire is just a wish and that there is no such person. But I need, for once in my life, my mother to tell me just the state of the matter, to listen to what I say - so we can both overcome our anxiousness and work together.",1,0,1742933384.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jjsyro/i_feel_like_i_cannot_trust_my_mom/

My father recently spent his whole years salary on a brand new car, a decision in which I thought was astronomically stupid. He also spends a shit ton of money on the lottery and women. 
My mother spends money on clothes and shoes that she almost never wears a second time. She sees it as a good investment despite never re-selling these clothes or getting rid of them.
My father has shown to me over and over that he cannot be trusted. Currently he wants to use my social security information to open up another bank account because his credit score tanked so hard, he will not be able to open up another credit line for a store credit card. He also wants to try to take out a MORTGAGE in my name for a house that I do not want any part of. He has never been one to pay his bills on time, so I already know that he will not pay his mortgage. 
Furthermore I am going to need to take out a private loan myself for schooling, and if I do these things for my father, my career will be in jeopardy.

1jjptar,Should I cut off my family before I go to university?,Altruistic_Lie_6757,"Hi, I'm 17 years old and have wondering if I should cut my family off after I've turned 18 and gone away to university. I have felt like cutting off my family for many years now, the earliest I remember meaning it being when I was around 13. My plan was to wait for me to get into university and then live in accommodation and to live off my student loan money and to have a side job as a tutor to earn enough money to live off of. Those were my financial plans, the other part was to leave for university by myself without them. As it would be the perfect time, as I could pack up all my belongings without it looking suspicious and mail it to myself to pick up wherever I go to university and just get the train there. I was also going to leave like a letter or something with an explanation that I had left home on my own accord and that I didn't want to interact with them again so they didn't think anything bad happened. Now down to the real reason I am writing, I've recently been having doubts about my plan and if I should actually cut them off. So here's some main reasons why I wish to leave :

1. I've been constantly told throughout my life that I have been a burden to this family and told by my sister on a couple of occasions that she wishes I had never been born. For some context, I am the youngest child of 4 and my parents had me a bit later in life so there's quite a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. But back to it, I have been constantly told that I was a burden and a drain on my family, and hearing that a lot from growing up has had quite a negative impact on me and still hearing it is quite a sore spot still.
2. I am always made to feel worthless and all my achievements are undermined, not only that anything or attention I get is quickly taken away from me. This has been a constant throughout my childhood and teenage years because my issues just weren't as important as everyone else. A couple of main ones that come to mind, the first being when I received an offer for medicine and my sister was with me, she insisted that she would call both of our parents so she could tell them; despite me saying I would she ignored me and did it. Before that when I got another offer for medicine (my first one I received)and she wasn't the first person to find out, she king of ruined the moment within 5 minutes cause she got upset cause she found out ""last"" (she didn't), and then whenever it was mentioned gave snide remarks. Also when I got my GCSE results, I got quite high grades so some of my family members (not immediate) congratulated me and stuff, she would get a bit upset and say it was a bit unfair no one said well done to her when she was the whole reason I did so well. My mother, left me alone in an important virtual meeting type thing during high school because my sister in law needed help with cooking (they hadn't even started cooking yet) but my mum immediately got up and left, and cause I was required to have a parent there and she was gone for so long I got kicked out of the meeting. BTW : they were making a simple sweet dish which takes like 30 minutes to make and they easily could have waited. Nearly everyone aside from my father, used to call me stupid and an idiot whilst comparing to other family members who go to grammar schools (which we don't have any in the area we live), it wasn't till I was 16 and got my GCSE results did it die down. But since then I get told that I think I am better than everyone else whenever I even say anything.
3. They're so emotionally draining to be around; like hanging out with my family is genuinely so tiring and drains me so badly. They will complain that I don't spend time with them but when I do all they do is belittle me or just ignore me entirely. As well as that they're so manipulative and sometimes plain aggressive. For example, I could do the slightest thing on accident and my sister will get angry at me and be really rude to me however I am not allowed to reciprocate the behaviour. I can genuinely apologise with tears in my eyes and all I get told is it doesn't mean anything. However, if she has wronged me I have to accept a sorry in any form if I ever do receive one and it's usually fake. I'm expected to accept it or she will just get angry with me again, and it's awful cause she knows what do to make me upset in turn. She will message me horrible things full of swears and delete them later or just isolate me or hit me sometimes and tell me she wishes I wasn't born. One time she got so angry with me cause I forgot to recycle a water bottle she wouldn't let me study for over an hour and I had my final exam that day to get my result for a side subject I did in the first year of college. But going on to pure anger I would have to go along to my mother and brother. As I mentioned before my parents had me a little later in life, so my mother has long given up on being a parent to be honest, I think since I was an early teen she stopped mothering me, on the odd occasion she will ask if I want something cooked. I know this may not seem like much but during year 9-10, I developed some issues with my salivary glands and so I used to get really sick sometimes because my throat would swell up to the point where I couldn't drink water without being in a lot of pain. It had developed so much that the doctors could actually see what the issues was so I didn't have to waste time being diagnosed (for it to be in that state it has to have developed for about a year); I had mentioned multiple times that it hurt when I ate spicy food and I couldn't eat it but no one believed me until the evidence actually formed. Due to that I have had to deal with this issues for years and only recently gotten over it after having 2 surgeries. So yes my mother was quite dismissive of anything I bought to her, but she could also be sometimes violent but she mainly stopped after this one incident when I was younger. On this one occasion, she was hitting me with one of those wooden shoe horns on my legs so ""no one would see"", and it was punishment for misbehaving because I didn't clean up my room or something. I covered my legs with my hands so she hit those and then we later had to go the hospital cause we thought she broke my wrist. She didn't it just had internal bruising that's why it was so painful for me to move it but since then she has stopped hitting me for the most - I think that trip kind of scared her because we just said I hit my wrist against a banister. But on to more recent things she has grown quite a lot meaner, she swears at me sometimes and has called me a b\*tch and a sl\*t before. She tells me that I need to put an effort into how I look, but complains I wear to much makeup.I don't like spending time with her cause all it ever results in is her insulting me. My brother he's also quite mean, he's the oldest of all of us and lives with us with his own family too. Sometimes when I come downstairs, he will tell me to go study or sit in my room since this isn't my house and that I am getting in the way (it's my dad's house not his yet) I have been told this a couple of times on occasion. Anything that is left outside of my room is usually used by others, broken or thrown away, so I keep everything to my own room now. They wonder why I feel so out of place at home yet no one bats an eye when I am given a reminder this isn't my home.
4. The manipulation that they do is lowkey crazy. Not really manipulation this first part but another thing to note, my sister used to egg my mum on to hitting me and stuff when I was younger. For example when I was 11 I got a report card with 5s and 6s (so Bs and Cs) and she got my mum so amped up to hit me or get angry at me (and done so on other numerous other occasions when I was younger too). It didn't even make sense either because they didn't give out the high grades in the middle of year 7 anyways. Whenever I mention this to her, she either tells me I am remembering it wrong or that when it went on long enough she would tell mum to stop. Tbh, majority of the stuff I remember from my childhood is the bad stuff, cause obviously those are the things that would stick with me right? But whenever I mention it , I genuinely don't know if I am being gaslit or not because they will say I am lying. Then they will make up something obviously false and claim I said it to make fun of me, but sometimes admit that I was telling the truth on some things. Like when I was younger, my sister didn't refer to me by my name she would only ever call me a b\*tch and made me respond to it ( I was around 6-8 and she was in her mid teens). But they even gaslight me about things that have happened not too long ago, like a couple months before my GCSEs, I was fighting with my mum and sister and they both told me if I didn't do well, that after GCSEs I would be 16 and they would just marry me off. But whenever I bring it up (and i get really emotional cause I hate that idea), they claim I am lying or they were joking or something. Whenever something upsets me it's a joke, however ever since I have started matching their energy they have been fighting with me a lot more and saying how rude I am. And when I mention this is how they act, I am met with that I should be the better person. There's so many other little micro aggressions and stuff that they have done as well. A couple years back, I was in a really dark place where I used to genuinely believe that everything was my fault and all their issues lay with me and I hated myself a lot for it and I think I may have been a tad depressed. I remember my family making fun of the state I was in, one time whilst arguing before I was going to shower they stopped me and threatened to call someone so I would get taken away. I am grateful that I am far away from that place mentally and realise that it wasn't my fault and am thankful that I care about myself a lot more now :)
5. Marriage is a really daunting topic for me. I am really worried about what will happen, I have seen how my parents arranged one of my siblings marriages and they were tricked into choosing the one my parents wanted, my sibling also refuses to back out to not embarrass our parents. I don't want to go through that, I don't even think I want to get married. They already mention how they want to get married off the second I finish my course at university. When I have openly denied, I get guilt tripped by my family saying oh but we're so old and we want to see you get married. Not to be rude, but you had me late. Respectfully, that's not my problem. My sister even joked once saying if our parents found out they were dying whilst I was 18 they expect me to get married, I obviously said no and my mother got angry at that and proceeded to argue with me. I don't want to be there for this time, cause I know I will just get tricked into doing what they want and not allowed to back out to save face; and inevitably be guilt tripped by my dad.

Just to sum it all up then, for many years I have had quite some resentment for my family and cause of how they treat me still feel like I am worthless and a burden. There have been quite a few good moments but I don't think they can outweigh everything I have mentioned here and some. I want to cut off ties with them whilst going to university as it would be the perfect time, and I don't want to continue to go through life and end up accepting this treatment. I know I will financially struggle but it will be worth it to have some freedom mentally. In general, I am quite a happy person and quite chatty in public but going home tears that down. I am usually quite non-confrontational but sometimes (mainly at home) I get too annoyed and give in and get angry. (I am the type that just get angry and cries it out tho). I think if I can work hard enough to be able to get some form of therapy I might as well, because it feels really nice to be able to get this all out of my system.

I just wanted to get an outsider outlook and give a rough overview and to get an idea if it seems worth it and I am not just screwing up my life. I would really be grateful for some advice :)",1,1,1742925762.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jjptar/should_i_cut_off_my_family_before_i_go_to/

If we go against her will we will be not able to do whatever we like she will defiantly ruined that. She is an amazing manipulator because i have manipulated by her for years and i realize recently my other family members also included that manipulation like they actually betraying for years. If anyone care about me or do something good to me after that she will definitely make up some rumours and make me push away from them but she will be good to them though and that's absolutely a sick behaviour. Also she make us feel good like she is doing good to us like giving life advice's when we go through some bad situation and will always calm us down in every bad situation but it's not. The amount of lie's and amount of rumours that she makes and ruins everything because of her jealousy and narcissist behaviour she literally ruined my life and act like nothing happen  Infront of me and my family. She is non other than my own cousin.

1jjoo33,Toxic relationships with living situation,Few-Equipment8668,"Sorry for the long read, but this has a lot of details about the stuff me and my family had to put up with.

In January I had my son with my fiance and I take care of her son as well, her son is 2 years old and doesn’t know his dad very well. In his eyes I am dad because I’ve been there since he was a couple weeks old. 

Anyways we knew our 1 bedroom apartment wasn’t enough for all of us, so me and my mom said we can all pitch in to rent a bigger house. We’ve been settled for almost 2 months now and there’s been minor issues between me and my fiance. 

A majority of the major concerns between us is my fiance feels I’m taking my moms side whenever there’s a disagreement, my fiance didn’t want to live with my mom in the first place because my mom has very strong opinions on how to raise her grandson. She also believes in anti-vax (we don’t) flat earth, and that the world is ending soon and god is coming to get us so be ready.

My mom goes to bible study, goes to church and has Bible study homework all the time, watching religious movies and shows. We figured moving in with my mom, we would get a lot of help with the boys but she is out of the house a majority of the time.

Again it’s not her responsibility but my fiances mom lives down the street and she’s been more of a help.

Main issue we had was my fiance feels my mom is too controlling over our son. Ever since I started dating my fiance my family didn’t like her, like she was a lost cause or she was taking advantage of me.

Since we moved in my mom and fiance were arguing over the degree of the thermostat. 1 degree issue, it wasn’t too serious but at that point I was the middle man. Expressing how both ppl felt and that one person was warm (warmest room is our room) and it being cold downstairs and my mom’s room.

I don’t believe im a good messenger, if im being honest i felt like this whole thing was ridiculous and idk why 1 degree is an issue. But I guess i came across the wrong way and my mom goes to my “stepdad” crying.

My stepdad doesn’t live here, until yesterday I didn’t know he helped pay to get us into the house but he didn’t sign any paperwork to live here. My mom and him have a son, he is 16 and homeschooled but my stepdad visits occasionally. I guess he’s not officially my stepdad cause they’ve been engaged for 10+ years. 

We used to live with manny (stepdad) he’s a big intimidating guy, probably on steroids, been in the gym industry for longer than I’ve been alive probably. However he no longer lives with us and for all we know, he could be doing god knows what. He says he’s been in border patrol and got a job opportunity with homeland security. 

My uncle (my mom’s brother) was the first one to see through his lies. My uncle is a correctional officer, he told manny if you work for border patrol send me an email from your government email. Anyways my uncle believes he’s giving my mom the run around and he’s living a second life with another family.

Next thing u know my sister comes across a photo with my stepdad with another woman in wedding attire and clearly celebrating. In the caption it says congratulations to my brother and I can’t wait to meet your son who was probably 6-8 years old.

I believe everyone was upset, me, my sister, my brother (mannys son) and even my mom. I feel like my mom didn’t know what to do at the time. But manny being a controlling/intimidating/manipulative lier. I wouldn’t be surprised if he told my mom a tall tale about everything going on and I’m sure she believes it.

He’s been telling us he’s gonna buy us a house to live in since I was a teenager, he promises that he knows a guy that owes him a HUGE sum of money, like last year he knew me and my fiance was struggling and he told me he would pay rent for us for a whole year, even get us a nice SUV. And he’s waiting for said sum of money.

I’ve always been somewhat afraid of him, I do have feeling a for him because we’ve known him since I was a young child 4-6 years old for me. However idk what his problems are but when he gets angry, he gets into pitbull mode like no calm discussion, it’s you listen to me and you don’t argue with me. He takes any resistance personal and he will get aggressive, in your face, called me homeboy before like he hasn’t known me since I was a child and I was some random guy giving him shit.

Anyways manny always had these “talks” when my mom couldn’t control me or my sister. However we’re adults now, we pay rent and our share of duties.

Last year he threatened my sister when we didn’t want my mom to talk to him anymore and he told my sister to keep her mouth shut or something bad is going to happen to hwr, and he implied “getting beat up isn’t the worst thing that will happen to you” we have no documentation of said threat because it was over the phone but we called the cops and gave a report.

My sister asks me and my fiance if manny is still home cause she doesn’t feel comfortable around him. 

This last weekend my mom and manny went to big bear and I had my dad and some family over. My mom flipped out because she said no guests but I want my family to be able to visit, like my dad or my fiancés mom  to see her grandson.

Anyways she calls my dad yelling at him and i guess my dad said everything was fine until she called him a loser. My dad flips out and tells her he’ll expose manny and his other family.

Next thing I know manny is calling me because he found out I told my dad about his situation. Tbh I’m not very secretive but my dad knew this last year and he didn’t really care, or maybe he didn’t but none of his business.

Manny is again calling me homeboy, said I opened my fat mouth and he’ll be here in 10 minutes. I said can’t we discuss this like adults ? He said fuck no. I hung up and called the cops and put in another report, manny never showed up but I got a nice boost of adrenaline over the 30 second phone call.

My mom confronts me later saying I need to stop telling everyone their business, i never really cared to share her business until manny wants to come into mine and my sisters. And she said she wants to keep us safe as she looks away and says, “ I can’t talk to much about it”

Last year my mom told my sister that manny had powerful friends, I can’t say what she meant but I’m sure she believes manny has some shadowy figure that can ruin our lives like the snap of a finger. Idk how they will ruin our lives but my mom believes it and I feel she is afraid. I want to believe she still has feelings for this guy but idk why she defends a man that threatens his kids, and doesn’t want to live with the family he’s know for 10+ years.

I’m a veteran, I have paranoid schizophrenia, the drs asked if anyone in my family has it. I said no, to my understanding it happens to ppl in their 20s (like me) and it’s somewhat genetic/environmental. But I learned yesterday that there is late onset, also that it happens more to women in their 40-50s, my mom is 45.

After that argument with manny, my mom and fiance start arguing over the thermostat but this time, they got in each others face in the hallway. I was on the bed, everything can be heard on camera (baby monitor in our room) I was tending to my infant, and I heard this. I didn’t know what to do, I knew my son was fussy and would cry if I put him down and he may feel unsafe hearing the argument. 

Anyways I walked over with my son in my arms and I told them to get the F*** away from each other. I feel like I wasn’t being listened to so I escalated the problem. I started yelling at the top of my lungs to “get the f*** out.” I proceed to yell this 4-6 times and I also yelled “I can’t believe the shit that happened today” ( getting threatened over the phone) and that my stepdad was coming to start some BS with our kids here.

Idk how to go about this, I brought it up with our couples therapist who sees us every Monday at 7pm over the phone. And I just want nothing to do with manny anymore.

I’m sure my mom feels like this can be fixed and her way of getting it fixed is having manny tell everyone how it’s going to go down or give us some stupid ultimatum. 

I know I was probably in the wrong for escalating the situation but I’m over walking on eggshells around my mom because I’m afraid of manny. It’s not fair to us and I don’t like the personal bias she has towards my fiance. 

And it’s not all sunshine and daisy’s with my relationship, but we’re working on it. Sure we get upset with each other and need space. But I feel like we found a bigger problem in our lives and it just muted out any issues we have with each other.

I feel like we want to leave but I don’t have enough money to do so, and getting enough space for us is going to cost way more.

I just don’t know what to do, manny wants to talk, my mom wants to talk. This morning she calls me saying she wants to talk and gets all angry about me not wanting to come outside. Then she told me to stop being a prisoner and grow some balls.

1jjlqeu,i have a habbit of lying- now it is hurting me alot,VanitasPH,"this is gonna be a long post..

I'm 18 (f) and still in school. I've always had a hard time trusting people, my parents and family included and I've also always had a hard time with the concept of truth. I'm not sure if its a habit or trait at this point but I lie a lot, I manipulate truths too. now in January (three months ago) my older sister and mother found my box of adult toys. (vibrators, dildos, condoms, lube etc-) they were extremely angry, especially my mother. i understood where she is coming from and promised her that I would throw it away. (yeah, I couldn't). and told her that I did. she was fine with the vibrators but she was furious about the dildo. i kept it in a box out of use. i swear I never used it after that incidence and it was kept inside another box. i honestly forgot about it for a while. I’m not sure what I am, I don't consider myself sexualy very active, I had those and used them for a while but never after and especially not after my mother found out. today, my father called me in and told me to get the box, I was told that it was a stupid thing to do and that it completely ruined me. i get it, I was stupid and I have lost all the trust In my parents that I had. i tried hard to build it back up, I've been studying and working as much as I can, my social circle is nonexistiant, I'm trying to trust myself (its hard because I never really have trusted myself), I'm trust to change. today, I saw that I had broken each and every bit of trust I had in my parents. I'm ashamed of myself, I'm tired and the amount of times I have through of something suicidal is a lot more than I can count. I've lost my tears. i feel like I failed everything I had been trying to achieve for the last three months. i know I should have thrown it away, I know I should have told my mother but I was scared she would be angry over another lie. i always overthink. i don't know what to do anymore. I'm stupid, I'm messed up, broken and ruined. and most of all I don't know how to get that trust back with my parents.

1jjfte2,Confronting parents after DNA tests,Just-Drummer1687,"Please help me with your advice. I (43,f) recently found that i have some hereditary heart condition that motivated me to do a DNA test. A part of DNA test showed also ancestry and I have realised that I have no genes from the country my father originally comes from. Instead there is big percentage of countries that are unknown in my family. Which made me realised that my father is not my biological father. My parents (f 68 , m 71) were never good parents. There was abuse, lies, stealing, a lot of manipulations in my family (especially from my mother), so having normal adult constructive converstation is off the table. I convinced them to do another ancestry test alltogether, so it would be clear what i got from my mother and what should belong to my father, but i know that the test will again show that my father is not my biological father. The problem is not only that my mother lied but also she cheated on my father after 4 years of marriage. Wait, there is more! Background story: I had brother who was 4 years older than me and he died at 27. He didnt look like anyone in my family, so everybody suspected that he has some other father. How this happened: my parents met when my father visited from his homecountry because of work, than he went back to his country and my mother got pregnant. When she told him about his preganancy, he was so excited that he came back and immediatly married her. He was also excited to get a new nationality. So he used the situation to get a nationality from a richer country and my mother used the situation to get a father for a child. When my brother was born it was very obvious that he belongs to someone else- it was like comparing slavic people and latin people. And i often heard people commenting on that. So, apparently after about 3-4 years into a marriage and with a small child, my mother cheated on my ""father"" and i am a product of the cheating. She was low-key constantly belitteling and abusing me (i have some vague memories about sexual abuse when i was very small, but i am not sure if it really happened), she stole a lot of money from me which i got from some car accident as a child, she was bad mouthing me to other people. She did not baptised me (all children in my family were baptised as babies). But all this abuse, neglect and manipultaion happended very low key so that no-one would guess (she can be very charming person to other people). After doing my first test, i showed it casualy to her and her response was dismissive and bored. Now i will have another evidence and i stand in front of dilemma: 1.Should i send them results without  a comment (i live in some other country) and let them deal with it 2. Should I send results to my mother and let her process everything and prepare how much she will tell me (i am not expecting much) 3. Should i confront them in person (they are very manipulative, they will make me a bad person) 4. Should i send tests to other relatives (my aunt and cousine)? My mother also convinced my relatives what a bad person i am and they were disrespecting me my whole life-i cut ties with them tho. 5. Any other suggestions from Reddit??? Parallel story: my mother wants to put my name in a will that i should care for both of my parents (that would mean i should leave my current country where i have career and move back to my homecountry where the employment situation is very bad, so it would mean giving my life for them)- for that i would get the whole house and not just a half (it is an old house nothing special). What do i want out if this? Justice. I will probably never find out who my real father is (countries in the DNA test suggest he might be gipsy), but after all this years of manipulation, hate, lies, abuse, disrespect (i am in the therapy now, i am not able to form healthy relationships with people, still healing) I have something to throw in her face. AT the same time i worry there will be drama and my father might kill her or kill himself. So either nothing will happen or everything will happen. It can not be solved maturely. What should i do?

1jjb9td,I HATE my sister!,SnooObjections8549,"I (22F) have a younger sister (19F) who has literally been terrible all of my life. We have never gotten along especially in the past few years id say and the way she acts is so unhinged. She’s always been pretty disrespectful and a straight up BIT** to everyone as a kid and I just assumed that she would eventually grow out of it but now at 19 she’s still the same. She’s super judgemental over every little thing about you, she laughs and makes fun of things that you literally cannot control like I’m severely anemic and have been experiencing a lot of thinning hair and she laughs at that as well as our mom has been struggling with severe weight loss due to her medication and she makes fun of her for that. And the list honestly just goes on. You’d think I’d be used to it now but I honestly don’t even want to be around her. She has not a single manner in her and she’s extremely selfish and thinks she’s better than everyone. I’d literally move out if I could because of her. I’m tired of always walking on eggs shells in my own home because of her. When she’s not home I’m 10000% better. I don’t trust her at all and I’m literally tired of the way she acts. I don’t know what to do at this point. If I’m going to be honest I always thought that she would one day get punched in the face when she was in high school but that day never came.

1jja4th,I need some advice,Excellent-Theme5177,"Hi, this is my first ever post on here, I (16M) am having problems with my family, specifically my parents.
A little background, my mother has been working nonstop for as long as I've known her, my father left me and my brother (16) with our mother when we were 3 on our birthday party, after that our mom had worked to keep the three of us afloat, unfortunately she couldn't do everything so she had to occasionally ask my grandfather for money to pay bills, we moved around a lot until I got into elementary school when everything went to hell, my mother and my aunt were close, I say close because she died on November 2nd 2018, when she died our family went into what I call the second great depression, my mother from then on would drink and smoke non-stop to the point where I had to help her get inside and get her food before getting her into her bed for the night, my brother didn't do so much as anything to help her, he would only watch anime or play games on our PS2 while I stayed downstairs and waited for our mom to finish drinking and get her to bed. Eventually it's 8th grade and everyone hated me because one of the popular girls disliked me because I told her to shut up when I was trying to learn Spanish, my mother at this point is finally trying to get back to dating but that didn't go well, so we had to move in with our grandparents, now in 9th grade we were disliked by everyone because we were new so we tried out for the musical and we were hated more because my brother and I got leading roles, eventually the school year ended and we were invited to our half-sister's sweet 16, we went there and when we did we were told our father would be there on the day of the party, the three of us hated the idea of him being there, but we delt with it, our mom wanted to stay away and so did we. On the day of the party our mom was in her car and my brother and I were talking with our sister until he got there. To say the least I didn't like him, he told us how he watched us grow on Facebook, and came to any public musical we were in, to me it was creepy. Fast forward and my mother and father are BACK TOGETHER. I don't know how it happened but it did, he convinced her to move to Alabama with him which is like 12 states away from us, eventually she moved because of her rynared syndrome (she gets numb to the slightest temperature change) she wanted us to visit every single year and it is just too hot down there for me to handle. I didn't like going there but I liked meeting my half siblings (there are 15 of us confirmed) aside from that I disliked It. Now I'm a jr. In high school and my parents want me back there and I don't know if I can handle it because my mom and dad weren't there for my brother and I for 2 years when we were in middle school. Honestly I don't know what to do, my mom and dad are far away and I hate them, people at my school hate me, my friends don't have time to hang out with me, my grandparents are pushing me to get 95's in school and my brother won't talk to me, I'd appreciate some advice.",1,0,1742872934.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jja4th/i_need_some_advice/
1jj8lpc,A Question for Adult Kids,Frosty_Importance598,"I have a question for adult children of an elderly parent who no longer speaks to you and has never told you why….. Am I the only one? I am 45, and the only girl of 4 kids. My mom and I have never been super close, and she’s never been what I would call loving, but I was always fed, dressed and cared for as a child. My dad was a fantastic man and he and I were very close. We lost him 2 years ago suddenly and since, my mom has all but completely stopped contact with me. Before he passed, she would text me on occasion and I had visits with them (we lived on opposite sides of the USA at the time). I know no one is perfect, least of all me, but it has been the most painful thing I’ve been through as far as relationships go feeling like I am worthless to the person who brought me into this world, and I don’t know why because she is not the type who will tell me. She is not a good communicator when it comes to emotions and that has been true my whole life, one of my brothers and I have had a talk about it and he has felt the same way. Somehow I have let her down or failed to be who she expected of me? I don’t know. What I do know is that all I’ve ever wanted from her was some form of mother daughter relationship and she’s in her 70s and shows no signs of changing anything or even being receptive to talk. In the past year I have sent her messages and asked her how she was and what’s new in her life. She’s read them all almost immediately but not once has she responded. I hate to say this because I have been really working on myself and letting go of what I can’t change, but I can’t help but feel like if the person that brought me into this world does not think me worthy of acknowledging when I truly don’t know what I’ve done to be so, then how am I worthy of anything? I know that sounds dramatic, but it has truly affected my self worth. I just wanted some form of relationship with the person that brought me into this world- I don’t want her money, her possessions, Ive never asked her personally for anything and I don’t know how to heal this wound and stop wishing things could change or be different.

He'll straddle my side if he's sitting beside me when he begins to like mess with me, kinda climb on me, grab my arms and like hold them above my head to like tickle my sides or my neck. 
He just makes me feel really uncomfortable and it's gotten to the point where I really don't like coming home sometimes (Ive been wanting to move out for the past 3 years)

My grandma doesn't do anything, and when I try to explain my uncomfort to her. She brushes it off and says ""He's just messing with you."" And it doesn't feel like Im being heard. 

I've tried to express my uncomfort to him, but simply told Im sensitive, being the dirty minded one, and having an attitude. Im a survivor of SA so some certain touches make me uncomfortable really bad. I don't know if I should tell a teacher or a family member but I always feel weird after he does it and I just want to get away from him. It's just my Grandparents and I who live together.

There’s a lot more to it but thats the gist of it.

1jix6d6,Am I[25m] in being a jerk for not wanting my godmother to see me play at jam nights ?,AB__22,"I’m 25 years old, I work as a software developer remotely, I had plans to move out of my mother’s house but I currently live with my mother for other reasons that are too much to explain in here. However I contribute a lot in the house, I pay for groceries, light bill, internet, cell phones, water, and even bought my mom a battery for her car recently. Only thing my mother pays right now is the monthly rent. My mother has always had a tendency to be over protective with me, she has this huge issue with bars and alcohol to the point where I can’t even drink one single beer in front of her without her making a huge issue out of it. I’m also a musician and have recently started going to these weekly jam nights in some local bar. I have been doing this for months and have been really responsible about it, the most I drink is three light beers and I always eat something in the place so I never come home drunk or even super late, but as expected, when my mother realized I was going to a bar for the jam nights she got all nosey about it and started asking me stupid questions like what do I drink in there or how many people go, etc. and started warning me about worst case scenario situations like someone spilling something in my drink or some ridiculous shit like that. I try to ignore her but it makes me really anxious, I just want to play guitar and have a few beers but every time I leave the house to go there I can see the tension between us and how awkward it is, but the worst part was a few weeks ago, when my mother randomly told like half of the family that I was going to the jam nights every week, I was really upset about this because I wasn’t planning to tell my family that, but I’m pretty sure she did it on purpose just so the whole family could know. I know that the bar is a public place and technically anyone can go but it almost felt like my special spot and one of the few places where I could ease my mind and disconnect from my family for a bit. But now thanks to my mom everyone in the family fucking knows it and started asking me a bunch of stupid questions about it. Then to top it all off my godmother said “oh well I’m gonna go next week to see you play”. The problem is I don’t really think she genuinely wants to go to see me play, I feel like she just wants to check up on me to see if I’m drinking and tell my mother how I’m behaving over there, and she has had a history of being nosey about other things in past situations. When she said that I just ignored her comment, but yesterday she asked again when I’m going to play and is being very insistent on going. I am incredibly frustrated that I have to deal with this at 25 years old, I am tired of having to justify myself and give explanations to my family and mother of everything that I do. This was one of the few places where I had space from my family and now thanks to my mother that is ruined too, I’m sick of feeling monitored about the little social life I have when I’m a 25 year old man being treated like I’m 15. I wish they would just give me some space and leave me the fuck alone but at the same time I wonder if I’m in the wrong for not wanting her there ?",1,0,1742839182.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jix6d6/am_i25m_in_being_a_jerk_for_not_wanting_my/

1jijnnz,"I have no clue what to do here, help ...",LongAd1820,"So, I need some advice. I know I should be forgiving, but I'm struggling a little bit. Curious to know what advice I can get here from Reddit.

So, a quick backstory. My biological father was really never there for me during my childhood and ended up giving up his parental rights to me when I was around 12 years old. 

I reconnected with him when I went to college at 17.  Worked with him at the same company when I was 20 or so. Left a few years later, then came back to the same company. I say all that to say we had opportunity to establish and maintain a relationship even if it was just hopping on a call once a week and saying hello. 

I'll also say that for the most part any time we do talk even today, it's generally because I call him. 

Around a year ago he and his wife at the time started going through a divorce. We talked a few times in the last year, but the last time we spoke at any length it really bothered me. 

He talked to me about how he felt he hadn't done enough to be there for me growing up, and how he thought his soon to be ex wife at the time was a main reason why. She wanted him to focus on her and my step brother and my half sister and their family. He seemed like he was really trying to get it all out and I felt some relief hearing it all. Then he said it.... He started talking about how he missed his soon to be ex and that if she would just take him back he would be back with her in an instant. 

My heart sank.... I felt like the whole conversation and apology and recognition of how poor of a father he had been meant nothing as he would take her back in an instant. 

I know these two things are probably disconnected, but it just seems disingenuous and a slap in the face. 

I know I should be forgiving of him, but it just seems difficult being I don't feel he was being genuine with the stuff he was telling me. 

I'm also struggling with this as I own some land. I've been wanting to get rid of this land, and I told my dad I would sell it to him. None of that has gone the way I'd like it to. 

He couldn't buy it during the divorce as he was not able to gain any assets. So he was going to wait until the divorce was finalized. He mentioned this to me around a year ago. I was under the impression it would be wrapped up fairly quick as he said they already had an agreement in place. Fast forward a year and he barely wrapped this up about 3 weeks ago. I found out from other family that lives next door to my land that they basically helped him move into my property. Did not ask, did not tell me, they just moved him in. Haven't heard a word at all from him about buying the land or anything. 

I know I need to talk to him about buying the land, and I'm worried I will be harsh with him as I'm worried I might try to conflate the discussion mentioned first here along and mix it with the land purchase part. 

I'm pretty confused by everything and, I am struggling to find the right steps to take though and in what order. 

Thanks in advance for reading this far if you did. Apologies for the length and kind of rambling, it's difficult to piece it all, give good information I feel is relevant to why I'm struggling and need advice. Thanks.

1jigs8i,Found out I have another brother,AssociationBig443,"Long story short, I’m a 22 year old female with two older brothers, one is a half brother one is biological. Growing up my parents had issues with my half brother which caused drama with my dads side which that in turn caused my parents to completely destroy any relationship we had with my dads side. Well I’m grown now so I went to see my grandparents after not seeing them since I was 8 years old, and I found out from them I have an older brother that my dad conceived when he was 18. 

I have NO IDEA how to feel, what to do, what to say to my parents or to just leave it alone. Apparently the guy doesn’t even know so I don’t want to try to find out and make an issue out of something that could possibly be a lie but I don’t see why my grandparents would lie to me.

1jhpxr8,What is wrong with my family dynamic,Zealousideal-Yam-789,"I’m the oldest of 3 and a 27F. Growing up, my dad had weird moods where he’d get upset at someone and just go mute for days and ignore all of us. When he wasn’t in one of those moods he was amazing. I feel like I spent a lot of time trying to keep everyone happy and trying to make sure nobody messed anything up to put him in a mood. My mom is wonderful and was great mother, but she’s definitely a huge gossip. Growing up she always confided in me with her issues with my dad, our financial situation, and just everything. 

I was a really good kid and always felt like my parents favorite. My dad even told me I was when I was in college. My brother is a lot like my dad and isn’t very emotional. He didn’t always get along with the family. My whole family (mom, dad, brother - middle child) have always shit on my little sister. My dad has told me he can’t stand her, she has different political beliefs which they hate, and they just hate everything she does.

I have a great relationship with my sister. A good one with my brother. And I feel like I have a good relationship with my parents, but things have seemed off lately. 

My family is weird but I love them. I’m married (6 years) and living a few cities away. My brother recently got married at 23 and his wife is 20. They bought my parents house that my parents were renting because the lady was going to sell and my parents don’t have money. My parents, brother, and his wife all live together now and they are all so close and get along surprisingly well. For some reason it’s making me feel like an outsider and like I don’t have a family anymore. Maybe I’m jealous in some way of my brother, but I wouldn’t want to be in his situation either. Whenever I visit it feels like im a family friend and not family. Nobody seems that interested in my life. I just go over there and listen to them all talk about their life and gossip about everyone in their church, neighborhood, extended family, and my sister. And I feel like when I’m not there they’re gossiping about me. I also feel like my brothers wife (who is 20) is the daughter they never had and she just replaced me and my sister. 

I did this to myself because I set some boundaries a few years ago. My parents wanted me around all the time which is sweet, but it was in a stressful way. Like if I didn’t come to something or didn’t visit enough they would make me feel so guilty about it and just guilt trip me until I finally give in and do what they want. Now that I don’t let them do that, it’s like I’m a stranger. They’re still good to me and still love me, but I’m not ONE of them. It’s hard to explain. 

I also can’t just go visit my parents because when I go over there my brother and his wife are always there and it’s like I’m visiting some family compound that I’m not part of. This whole thing is bringing up a lot of issues and feeling from my childhood and it’s just weird. It’s like I was the kid that always did exactly what they wanted. I was always trying to be perfect and I was their pride and joy because of that. As soon as I started living my own life they latched on to my brother who is now their pride and joy. I don’t know how to interact with them anymore. ",2,0,1742699420.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jhpxr8/what_is_wrong_with_my_family_dynamic/
1jhnv1w,Looking to cut contact with just about all my family (if not all) as soon as I possibly can. Advice?,3xisting3ntity66-6,"     First time poster. I'll try to keep this brief.
     Character list: Reese (older sibling), Lacy (younger sister) Kira (youngest sister), Bella (my mother), Alex (my father)
  !!ALL NAMES ARE FAKE!!
     I (14, afab masc nonbinary, he/they) do not care for my family. My older sibling (16, afab, not sure of their gender identification, they/them) makes me incredibly uncomfortable with comments about my appearance and my body. My younger sister (under 10) can throw a tantrum over the smallest things. The youngest is under 5, and I really don't have much to say about her. My mother (37-39, cis female) constantly claims to be supportive but refuses to use my name or acknowledge the fact that I am part of the lgbtqia+ community. My father (42, cis male) is barely better than my mom. Barely. He's called me my chosen name a few times (only once or twice around my mother) and has referred to me as his kid/son very few times, as well.
     Scenario with my older sibling: I can say anything relatively negative about myself or my appearance. Their immediate response is always to tell me I look amazing that day or to stop speaking so negatively. I could literally say that my hair looks bad because I haven't showered in almost a week, and they would say, ""Your hair looks great, I don't know what you're talking about."" That might not seem like anything much, but they have made quite inappropriate comments of my appearance (once even told me that they've had intrusive thoughts of raping/molesting/physically harming me).
     An example of my mother: When I first came out (technically for the second time, given I came out as trans in fifth grade and again in late 6th/early 7th), she said she would not be using my chosen name because it would ""confuse my little sisters"" and ""they don't/won't understand"". Whenever it's brought up? I'm told the same. They're too young to understand, it will confuse them, things like that. You have no idea how badly I've always wanted to tell her that they don't have to understand now, because they can respect it now and learn as they get older.
     As for my father: One day, I was half zoned out at the dinner table. My older sibling was at a friend's house that day, and the friend's parent had used their (my sibling's) preferred name. I snapped back to reality to hear my dad say, ""Next time, I'd just say that I don't have a kid named (sibling's name), but then that makes us the bad guys."" My mother, who was doing the dishes while everyone finished eating, agreed with him.
     Younger sister (Lacy): Just last night, we were at my grandma's. (Unrelated, but she did vote for Trump and, although very caring and loving, I do not think would like me very much if I came out as a masc-nonbinary, aroace satanist. She and my grandpa are very Christian, and heavily influenced Lacy after our great grandma's death last year—Lacy inherited her Bible.) She was playing air hockey with he youngest, and kept saying certain scores didn't count. I was already there with them when Lacy started to get mad at Kira, so I stepped in. I had only just begun trying to explain that she need to calm down because it was just a game, and those scores did count, when she went into a full-blown tantrum. She started screaming and crying that nobody loves her and that I've never cared about her (very random and uncalled for, given the fact I only told her that the score counted) and even threw her slider at Kira, which nearly hit her face. She refused to apologize, and told our grandma that she hated me when being coaxed to go back upstairs (I was sitting on the floor nearby, as I was already doing something downstairs when the ordeal had started). She never apologized, and today acted like nothing happened.
    Youngest, Kira: Both Lacy and Kira are extremely spoiled. Tell them no once, and they can go as far as to throw a two hour long tantrum until you cave. They were raised to get everything they want, which has totally blown up in my parents' faces. Kira is, as I said, under five years old and likely autistic. I already don't like children for my own reasons (side note: yeah, my parents have said that I'll probably grow out of that ""stage"". Spoiler, I won't, and they won't get grandkids from me regardless) but I hold nothing personal against my sisters. They can't help that they were raised like brats, nor can they help that my mother refuses to try to redeem her shoddy parenting and claims it would be too late or too difficult.
     With the reasonings out of the way, I need advice. I want to get a job as soon as I can, as well as my own card and my own vehicle. I do not want to be on my parents' insurance or legally connected to them in any way. I want to move out by the time I'm 18 or 19, but I am aware that it's not particularly realistic. This is where I ask for help. How/where can I find my own source of income? What would be the process of getting, say, a motorcycle under my name only? Or finding a vehicle insurance plan? I'm already good with saving/rationing money, but any tips for that is definitely welcome. Any information or details about becoming a liberated adult that might help or just to be known would be helpful! Thanks to all for reading, and any advice/tips you might have to give!

1jhm8vm,Advise: My sister could potentially miss my college graduation because of a sport,Fast_Possibility_258,"A little backstory my younger sisters have played softball since grade school. My parents have always supported them and me in whatever we chose to do. I have no problem with the sport I have always supported them even if it is not my thing. I may not have gone to every game but one once and a while I will. My family is very loving and supportive of each other on big achievements. When we were in high school my sisters would have to miss some important dates of mine (scholarship receptions, awards banquets, etc) because of softball. Do go to their grade school and high school graduations and be as supportive as possible. She did go to my high school graduation. I didn’t mind so much then because I don’t like being the center of attention and its high school it wasn’t that big of a deal for me because I knew I was going to college and my college graduation is more important then my high school graduation. 
My middle sister (20) has taken her softball career into college. I have a good relationship with her I try to come to some of her games but it is hard because we go to 2 separate colleges 3-3 1/2 hours apart. A few weeks ago I was told that they could potentially have a championship game on my college graduation date. I told my sister before my senior year started what my graduation date was so she could keep it open. This news has broken me. Im usually the type of person to go along with any plan and say yes to everything. You know that typically eldest daughter complex.  Tried to talk to my parents about making her come but their only answer is “She’s an adult. We can’t get mad at whatever she chooses.” I’ve also asked her to talk to her coach and see if they can find some way to work around it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been so devastated thinking I wont have my whole family down there supporting me.

But sometimes it gets annoying when she does it at this moment because it be about dumb and small things like leaving the window covers open because killers or wtv can look at the house 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I mean they can but like not 24/7 and it was in daylight & we have cameras. But the way she yells at me is like I got a ticket from the police. But like me in general don’t like being yelled at or talked to disrespectfully and it just triggers me when she yells at me, but I know I can’t rly yell at her cuz she’s my mom, I used to a lot & go crazy back then but I started to feel bad 💀 but I also know I shouldnt hold my anger in. What do I do when these happen should I just hold in my anger. I would communicate but I know she might start holding her anger in too & I don’t want her to go thru that should I j leave it?🧍🏽‍♀️🤦‍♀️",1,0,1742686452.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jhlu9e/what_do_i_do_when_my_mom_yells_at_me/

He had a crisis....now being treated and better....said crisis was contained to my home....that being said....sons wife is now using this as an excuse to move away and grandbabies cannot come to my home now. Children were not involved and knew nothing of the situation and were not in danger.

1jhgfxp,Husband has bad issue concerning his children (my step kids),Texasnative-89,"We are a blended family for context. 
Our children all get along really well, and his older kids (18 & 15) live with us are good kids. When his older children were younger their mother was a very unstable person and they lived with her, she still is unstable, hence why they live with us. She traumatized my husband when she would make him do horrible things just to be able to see the kids. He was working on getting his green card as he was a DACA recipient, and when the program dismantled he was working towards that path. She would try to deport him, and do all kinds of nasty things when she didn’t get her way. His children confirm that their bio mom is nuts! 
He joined the military and accelerated that process quite a bit, and he was gone a lot! She would only let him talk to the kids once a month on a specific day and time. If he was busy or at work she didn’t care, he missed it for the month. So he missed a lot of his older children’s lives when they were younger. 
He remarried and she had a daughter that he adopted, and they had a son together. When their marriage went sour (due to him being in the military) she wrote him a Dear John letter and waited for him to come home from deployment. He showed up to a house packed up in a uhaul and his children being rushed out of the state. He had to act fast to get an emergency order to keep her in the state, and she got out. He was devastated, and immediately called a lawyer and got to work on that divorce. 
Then COVID hit, and his divorce was very delayed. He agreed to whatever his ex wife stated in the divorce just to get it off his back. With her assuring him he could see his kids on breaks and she would work with him, he didn’t have her put all of this in writing. STUPID! 
When my husband and I got married the younger kids would come and visit and I’d always be there at drop off and pick up. I met their mother who soon began to REALLY not like me. Her daughter and I would have really deep conversations and I’d help advise her as best I could. She confided in me one day that her mom and new step dad would fight and yell and throw things. I asked what she would do, and she said take her brother in a room and go hide. I was heartbroken! So I told her dad, and he brushed it off and didn’t do anything about it. When I asked her the next time she visited how things were going she said that they were still fighting and it was emotionally draining. So I told my husband again, and again he brushed it off. One day the younger kids mom texted me talking crap, she had found out that me and her daughter had had talks about love, sex/boys (at a 12 year old level-safe sex, boundaries etc.) and just about life in general. Her daughter told her she really liked me as a step mom and it infuriated this woman to no end. I texted her back after she was talking crap and said something along the lines of your daughter expressed to me that when you fight with your husband in front of the kids it makes her feel unsafe. And yeah maybe I shouldn’t have gotten in the middle of that but I felt the overwhelming need to bring that to her attention. I was nice, polite, and even expressed it wasn’t my place but her daughter was really suffering from this. 
She lost it and called my husband and told him he wouldn’t be able to see the kids, and swung this elaborate story about what happened. Because they had not put more details on the custody in writing he couldn’t do much about it. She had the control. 
My husband came in a rage and was pissed at me without even asking me what had happened. My husband had never yelled at me before, never rose his voice in anyone’s presence. And he SCREAMED at the top of his lungs at me accusing me of being the reason he couldn’t see his kids. He started to act like a raging lunatic. 
I told him that none of that was true and why would he not ask me my side of the story? 
He left the house and didn’t come back for 2 weeks! Stayed with a friend, and I took care of his two children and my two children. 
I told him he needed to take his ex wife back to court and get a better custody agreement he made every excuse in the book on why he couldn’t do that and I was floored. 
When we finally talked it all out in therapy we got to a much better place as far as communication. The therapist asked my husband if he would come to one on one session without me, he felt he had really deep issue with the fear of not seeing his children that were really concerning. He went to two sessions and stopped. When I bugged him about it he said hed find a new therapist and start going again. He did, but never brought up this issue in 6 sessions with them. 
I really don’t know what to do, I’m not going to divorce my husband btw, I love him very much. But I don’t know what to do… he’s still like this and just flys off the handle if he thinks that he won’t get to see his kids. It’s sometimes a lot. 
It’s also noteworthy to say he refuses to show me any affection in front of his younger two kids. But in front of the older kids and my kids he’s fine with it, he won’t even hug me when they are around. He says he doesn’t realize he’s doing it and just has total focus on those two kids. He doesn’t include me or the other kids in the house in what they’re doing, doesn’t tell me what plans are with visiting schedules. He also won’t update me when the younger kids are having issues or successes they have. He looped me 100% out, and it hurts. 
When I asked him why he told me he just forgets and I have enough to deal with anyway. I would love to be in my step kids lives, even as a friend to them, but he’s literally blocking my relationship with them.

1jh1m48,i just need advice please,nottallbunny,"Hi everyone, I (20f) am currently in a situation where I don't know how to feel and have just been constantly crying over this and I'm trying to find comfort in the situation but somehow I'm having trouble.

My mother (39F) and father (46M) haven't been in love in years and I've known that for a long time. As of now my mom is planning on leaving my dad. Date on leaving and moving away: around mid May. 

I am currently happy with where I am and I love my life in the state that I'm in, but mom is planning on moving to the other side of the country. My mom and I had our ups and downs through my 20 years of living and I always had to remind myself that it was also her first time living too through all this, from getting married really young to having me at the age I'm at now, etc, etc...

My mom has been through a lot and she is the type of woman that would put everyone else first before herself even on the days she felt miserable she would try her best to be a good mom. So when we finally had the conversation it kept me in a shocked stage for weeks, it wasn't till a week or so ago when it finally hit me what was going on and since then I can't stop crying. I've been telling her through this whole situation to ""do what makes you happy"" and ""How will you know if you'll find happiness if you don't do what you want to do?""

I know, I'm 20 years old and still cry for my mom and I know about what I said to her and about her moving, but she has been such a big support throughout these past years even when we bump heads. I've been trying to stay strong for her because I know that if she moves away she'll be the happiest woman in the whole universe, and I don't want her to stay for me because she has always thought about me in every way possible. She sacrificed her childhood and her adulthood for me and her family and my father. She works 2 incredibly exhausting jobs and has always tried to give me everything I've wished for.

I feel like I'm derailing from my main point but, what can I do to feel happy for my mom and for her to finally have the dream she always wished for? I have the most supportive soulmate in the universe who has been helping me through this but what can I do to also help myself in the process?",3,3,1742622029.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jh1m48/i_just_need_advice_please/

Maybe i should stop feeding you because you're so large."" I was too shocked to say anything when it happened since i knew he was drunk and he has said stuff like this to me before. It just rubbed me the wrong way and I don't know who to tell. I'm scared if i tell my mom she'll get into a fight with my dad ad he'll hit her. 

I've never liked my dad. He always smokes weed and drinks 24/7 and he's a schizophrenic. I'm terrified of him!? No one should feel that way about their own dad.

1jgxeu6,Am I selfish for feeling this way?,Ok_Dragonfly_3405,"My husband and I have been married for 10 years. Prior to marriage, we were very independent of our families. We had hopes and dreams of building our lives together. We have two young children. 
6years ago his mother got out of a terrible relationship and my husband helped her move to our area (6hours away from where she was living). This is when everything changed. He felt as if he needed to take care of her, though she was a healthy 47 year old, at the time. His sister also needed to leave her terrible relationship and was helped as well, he moved her close by. His sister ended up back with her ex and now they have a child together. My husband, now, wants to buy a large house for all of us to live in. They are terrible with money and he feels obligated to take care of them. His sister and boyfriend are in the mid-twenties and spend hundreds of dollars on fast food. His mother is a shopaholic. 
We’ve argued and gone back and forth. I prefer my privacy with my husband and two children. He is very adamant that we should all live together and the movie Encanto really inspired him. He is looking at houses that will accommodate all of us as we speak. 
My husband and I have full time jobs and work really hard. I can’t see myself paying and taking care of able-bodied adults. 
Every-time I bring it up my husband makes me feel guilty because he’s always wanted our kids to grow up with family. Which I’m fine with but they need to be in their own place and paying for their own things. Or am I being selfish?

1jgwp4z,My (F15) Mum F(36) is really worrying me,Dog_in_bees_nest,"For context, in 2016, she tried to kill herself. Ever since then, she's been on benefits and such. She bought a dog during COVID to help stabilize her mood, after a friend's dog helped her out in that way. 

Because of the new benefits system, she's worried she's going to lose lots of money, and not be able to afford to care for the dog. 

Her benefits come under review in a couple years, when I'll be at uni. 

The thing that's worrying me, is that she blatantly said to me, ""if I lose as much money as I think I will, and I lose the dog, I'm going to kill myself.""

She said it so casually. As if she doesn't realise how scared I've been over the years that she'd hurt herself while I was out. 

I'm scared to leave for university, if she kills herself while I'm gone, I know I'll blame myself. But, I want to go, I want to live somewhere new, away from my family. 

I don't really know what advice I'm asking for, maybe I just need to get it off my chest.

1jgtq0r,Rant out my frustration,Ill_Awareness_2883,"I am frustrated because I’ve grown up in a house necessarily being the black sheep. I was too young naive and innocent to even understand why my sibling would talk down on me. Why they would tell their friends I don’t shower (which is a lie (I also truly don’t know why they would say that)). All my mom did was yell at them and say I’m their sister blah blah blah. 

She goes one for years just yelling, shouting, and complaining. She never does any actual discipline since she stopped whooping us. It just turned into fights, she can’t have a mature conversation at all. I’ve tried multiple times to set boundaries, have her trust me but she just goes on a rant not understanding anything I’ve said. 

She also has a motto of how a mom can pour so much intro their kids and they still end up the path they choose. I understand that, but it doesn’t apply to her she never poured any responsibility, wisdom, anything good into her kids. Only the wrong the wrong things. (which I’ll get to)

Im 19 years old now and I was a fool to stay in a house full of darkness lead people. I thought maybe I could save money then transfer it can’t be so bad. But you can’t grow in a place that put you in a bad situations. 

(Covid just brought the worst out of everyone) 

Now to talk about the situations: my house got shot up July of 2020. I was a freshman going on to be a sophomore. Ever since middle school there a certain someone who’s my twin. We are complete opposites I am day she’s night. Since she been stealing and get caught my mom would just keep what she caught to which she’ll just take back. Or she’ll give to the police station which she did for a gun. 

 Fast forward to now a few days ago she stole someone else’s things and they (idk for sure) were (going to set her up and take a gun she herself probably stole (ironic huh). I seem to only have the brains capable of anything in the house which is pathetic really. 

The people she stole were lurking around trying to find where they could spot her at (she was in the house hiding like the wannabe gangsters do) and couldn’t find her. I got into a lil heated moment with my older siblings on the phone because I find the fact that calling the police ultimately ends in nothing. 


My mom is going to continue to open the door for her child even it endangers the rest of the house holds life. To add on the July shooting my brother who was partially responsible moved in with his girlfriend. I don’t think my mom would’ve kicked him out anyway. Now she reject him if he is struggling and needs some place to stay.


To wrap this up in 8th grade I got a concussion, lost my self, and developed paralyzing anxiety. I slept in my mom room because of it and right when i mustard up some bravery to sleep in my own bed she quickly replaced me with her boyfriend who’s now her husband. I can go on and on and on but this is getting long. I just wanted to talk to someone about this because I’m just so alone. 


Ask questions or anything. Thanks for reading the plethora of words also :)

1jg9ti5,My mom is being strange about my dad starting to see other people,LonelySoup9725,"My mom (38) and my dad (41) spilt when i was around 6 and i’m now 18. They’ve only ever tried to get back together one time when my mom and my stepdad had a serious fight and took a break for like 3 weeks. That didn’t work out and they’ve been co-parents ever since. Recently, my dad has been getting into the dating scene again after not having really tried anything like that save for a few times since he and my mom split. I’m very happy for him since he seemed lonely when i was not there with him on his weeks and stuff. My mom and my stepdad have been together for just as long as she and my dad have at this point and while they fight a decent amount, they do love each other and always work it out. After i told my mom about my dad seeing some girl (the intention wasn’t to start anything i just tell my parents everything. I would’ve done the same if the situation was flipped) she started getting weirdly defensive and saying things like ‘He’s my best friend’ and that the other girl should know she was there first (whatever that means). It was weird and didn’t go with what i was saying at all and seemed to come out of nowhere. We went to go pick up something from my dads house today and while i was in there getting what i needed, she wrote on his trunk ‘I ❤️ ___’ (the blank is her name). I told her to erase it and to not be like that and she got defensive once again. Maybe i’m being weird about it but i thought it was petty even if she thought he would find it funny. She ended up erasing it (only because i told her to) and then proceeded to get in her feelings about how she doesn’t feel like she’s enough. I don’t know how to help her get through whatever she’s going through. My mom is very emotional and if her mood is down she ends up dragging everyone else down with her (which i don’t think is intentional).

My dad is now in the hospital with a lung infection, and his heart isn't doing well—his blood pressure is dropping low and then spiking high. They are giving him meds to help his heart. I'm currently 8 months pregnant, and I'm terrified. I love my parents so much, and I feel like my world is going to fall apart. I don't know what to do. 

I have a brother, but my parents are no longer speaking to him due to issues and things he's done. My dad definitely wouldn't want me to contact him, but I'm worried about my parents, and it hurts that everything is now my responsibility. My brother is older than me; he was always the more responsible one. When this situation happened, my parents made me the power of attorney and all this stuff that I never wanted because I always knew I wouldn't handle my parents' passing well or feel like I could make the right decisions when needed. 

I don't have a relationship with my brother anymore because of everything that's gone on, but I don't know how to handle this situation. I'm so scared. I'm not showing my parents how I'm feeling, of course, because I don't want to cause them any more stress. My father is my mom's caretaker since her stroke, and they live about an hour's drive from me. I promised my dad I wouldn't put either of them in a home, and I intend to honor that. I just don't understand how I'm supposed to be there for my mother, my father, my kids, and my husband.

My brother has no idea what's going on, and my father wouldn't want to see him. I'm not sure if I'm making the right decision. I don't have a relationship with my brother anymore either due to everything that's gone on, but at the same time, am I making the right decision by not telling him what's happening with our parents?

1jfzvfx,My brother is a freeloader and I’m tired of it.,ChipmunkNo7118,"I’m 27 years old (f) and my brother is 24. We’ll both have birthdays in May. We both live with our mom. He lost his job in December at his own fault and hasn’t found a new one since. Even when he had a job, he would barely help out with things around the house. Our mom doesn’t make us pay rent, so I try to help out in other ways like buying most of the groceries, cooking for everyone, cleaning, and buying other things we might need for the house. He MIGHT buy toilet paper once in a while, but since he lost his job he doesn’t help at all. He said he’s put in 40 job applications in 3 months.

I pay for my own insurance, car, and basically everything I need besides rent. Our mom still pays for his insurance, she lets him drive her car for free (except for gas), and just generally doesn’t hold him to the same standards as she did with me when I was his age. 

We got into an argument last week and I told him he wasn’t trying hard enough. He ended up screaming “f*** you, f*** you,” etc. multiple times in my face and just freaking out. He told us he wanted to kill himself (which he’s said before during similar arguments) and basically throwing a pity party trying to make us feel bad. 

I’m writing this because I worked from home today and I just watched him spend half the day making homemade bagels instead of using that time to look for a job. I don’t want to feed him anymore. I don’t even want to talk to him right now and I haven’t been. Am I wrong to be angry? He’s causing our mom a lot of stress and it’s stressing me out too. I go out of my way to include him when I eat out because I feel bad only getting something for me and my mom, but I’m tired of it. In the past he’s gotten mad because we ate out and didn’t ask him if he wanted anything (he never pays me back if I do). I’m so tired. I can’t even afford to live on my own and I’m expected to cater to him too. What do I do? My mom won’t give him any consequences.

1jfvqck,I sus my dad is cheating on my mom,Emotional_Gear5627,"Basically, my dad used to be a person who doesn't even bother to have a lock to his phone. From past few weeks, things seem weird. He's hiding his phone a lot, being late to home and also is having his phone on silent, which he never does btw. 

Today, my finals ended. So, him and I went to a movie. There his phone was on vibration. Between the movie I caught him texting through his phone. I didn't mind it at first. As I saw the contact name, it was a girl who works under him. I though maybe it's regarding work. But, then when he was closing it, that chat was in locked chats. 

No other contact was on locked chats, am I overthinking this? I really wish this is all in my head. What do I do? I am just a teenager, I don't know how to act, I don't want my family to tear apart.

1jfugg8,Advice needed,Firm_Loquat9813,"Hi all,
The short version of the story.
My boyf has 3 sisters, he's the youngest and was brought up being told he would inherit the family farm. The plan was that he would inherit the majority of the land and the sisters would get some land/property/money and were all put through eduction. He was not. Fast forward to 2022, he was 29 and land came up for sale locally. His parents asked him to sign the loan and he agreed. He now owns that land but the parents will not transfer anything else to him until the pass away. He works the farm by himself everyday, pays for the parents house, all bills, pays his parents a wage every month and pays himself very little. We're living in a mobile/trailer for 4 years while they live in a big house with spare rooms and one of the sisters who's 36 lives with them. They have now decided that she will get 1/3 of the land because she got fired from her government job. The house will be given to another sister who lives 2 hours away and wants to use it for Airbnb and the 3rd sister will get the house she lives in. My boyf is panicking over money and is just really down. All he wants to do is farm and be able to afford a house. I have a good job and tbh I think they consider my wages in his inheritance which isn't fair on him. We're expecting are first baby after being together 10 years and they are not happy. The whole thing is really disheartening, I need a new perspective, obvs there's a lot more to the story but that's a snippet . BTW we're based in Ireland.

1jfqzna,Parents in Retirement Driving Me Crazy - Am I the Only One?,RoamTheReals,"Hey everyone,

I'm in my late 30s and honestly, I'm at my wit's end with my parents. Since they retired, it's like everything's amplified, but the truth is, this has been going on my whole life. We're just fundamentally different, and it's creating so much stress.

Here's a glimpse into my reality:

We plan to meet at 11 am, and they're banging on my door at 10:40 am, already annoyed I'm not ready.

I needed new plant pots, so they ""offered"" to go to the garden center. It turned into a rushed, judgmental experience, with constant comments like, ""So, that's the size you need?"" There was zero patience.

They planned a trip with my brother's family, picked the hotel without even asking me, and booked a penthouse where l'd be on a pull-out couch. When I said no, I got the guilt trip.

They're always at my brother's because of their grandchild, which I get. But they only see me on my birthday. It feels... unequal.

And to top it off, sometimes when I call, my dad's response is just, ""Why are you calling now? Your mother's sleeping."" Like my call is a major inconvenience.

Growing up, I never felt like they had my back.
I've worked through a lot of that, but it's shaped our dynamic. I love them, but I can't be around them constantly. It's too draining. I'm not perfect. I run a bit late sometimes, and I have my own interests. But it's like everything turns into a battle. I'm starting to distance myself because I can't take the constant stress.

Does anyone else deal with this? How do you cope? I really need some advice.

1jfpn29,How can I make my mum less involved in my life?,Fiestysoul_123,"Let me clarify that I love my mum and that being involved in your daughter's life is great but it feels like my mum is paying too much attention to my life. I'm in my second year in med school, which is very challenging school but l've always managed, but my mum keeps popping in and telling me to study when I'm not. Like when I'm on my phone on a short break she comes in and tells me to leave my phone and goes as far as threatening to confiscate it. She asks me to either study with my door open or in the living room where she can keep an eye on me. And just as I touch my phone or do anything that's not study related she launches a full-on investigation about what I'm doing and what I have on which can get really frustrating as it feels like I'm constantly under scrutiny. I'm a great student, I get great marks and despite being ""always on my phone"" I actually proved to her multiple times that I can handle myself but she never lets me be. I have 2 older brothers and when they were in college she never did the same thing with them she never told them to put down the phone or ask what they're doing all the time and she just let them be. All she cared about was that they got good enough results but in my case I need to work ten times harder, which I do, but certainly everyone deserves a break and some privacy. I just want a solution to this because I feel old enough to take matters like studies into my own hands. I understand that she's worried, but it makes me feel less than human like l'm nothing but a study machine, her med student child teat brings glory to the family.

1jfe8ol,I genuinely don’t know what to do.,half_dead_demon,"I’m coming to Reddit because I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to age drop but for reference, I’m still quite young and not yet old enough to make a living for myself and I’m still in junior high. 

My parents have made my life as complicated as it could be, from my dad going to jail last July leaving my mom and sister and me with no food money, or my mom being an addict with a medical condition restricting her from daily activity. (She has cellulitis and cannot walk without the assistance of a walker. We can’t afford proper medication for her, hence the addiction). Last June my dad told me he would get a job. Guess what? He lied. Nothing new. My parents have been unemployed since summer of 2023. We’ve been living off of selling things on Facebook marketplace, ebt, and help from family (not to mention I’m pretty sure my parents sold/sell dr*gs). 


I guess that’s enough of the background information though, here’s the current situation: 
My school is very dear to me. If it wasn’t and I didn’t have so many people I loved so much there and a good education, I’d probably move far away from my parents and stay with my grandma like my doing over spring break at the moment. My parents just lost our house and we had to put all of our things in storage and it doesn’t look like they’re getting a new flat anytime soon. but I CANT LEAVE MY SCHOOL. I can’t stay in a hotel with these people for the next 9 weeks, it will destroy me inside and out, not to mention their constant bickering and fighting. But I can’t move away with family that would be happy to take me in, because as I said, my school is very dear to me. (It’s high in academics, the love of my life is there, and it’s a sota school so I get to do what I love) 

I’m just genuinely lost and I can’t believe my parents would do this to me and put me in this position. I’m coming back to my city in a few days (Sunday or Monday) so that I can do that week of school because it’s very important and then on Saturday I’m doing something with my boyfriend and  some upperclassmen before they graduate, so I don’t want to miss that. Is this normal? Having to pretend you’re like everyone else when you’re quite literally homeless? Having to lose people you care about and it isn’t even your fault? Being so scared and breaking down everyday until you just feel numb? 

If anyone has advice, I beg of you share some with me. I really need help and I just want to finish out this year. ",1,0,1742436098.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jfe8ol/i_genuinely_dont_know_what_to_do/

I’m going through a really tough situation at home and I don’t know what to do. My dad took my Nintendo Switch, and I’m honestly scared to ask for it back. The Switch was bought by my sister, and it’s mine, but my dad keeps taking it at night so I can’t play. Every time I challenge him or try to talk about it, he gets really angry, says ""stop arguing,"" and takes the Switch. Sometimes, he even hits me if I don’t give in.

I feel trapped because I’m afraid that if I speak up, things will get worse, and I might never get it back. I’ve tried asking him calmly, but it doesn’t work, and I don’t know who to turn to. I really don’t want to lose the Switch, but I also don’t want to keep going through this.

I am a 20 year old brown girl, my mom has the same old views where girls who go out and talk with guys are of bad character. She worries what the community might think of me especially since she is a single parent. 

Because of these fears, I've never really gone out without her anywhere except maybe like 3 times but each of the 3 times my mom accompanied me and just wandered around the place while I watched a movie with my friend and stuff. 

Today I asked to go to the library and she started giving me a lecture saying what would people think and stuff. I got upset and told her that she is controlling me too much and I don't have any friends because I keep staying away from them while they all make memories together. I see all these people sharing the friend they would turn to but I don't have anyone like that.

 I'm terrified I won't have anyone except my family. Due to her overprotectiveness, I'm very quiet and have such difficult time making friends. I just want to be like every other 20 year old and attempt new things and be able to make mistakes to learn from them instead of my mom hovering behind me trying to prevent me making mistakes in the first place.

 Everytime I try to say all this to her, she makes it seem like I'm overreacting and saying that she has given me all freedom. She loves and cares about me and does everything for me but it feels so suffocating sometimes. I feel like I have no personality of mine. 

Am I being too dramatic or are my feelings valid. Everytime I try to make a point with my mom she makes me feel like I'm just acting like a moody teenager.

I’m 25, my sister is 19. We’ve had plenty of fights while growing up, it got better as I moved out at 19 and started my own family. I have two kids, 4 & 1yr old. On Christmas Eve this year we were decorating the tree at my mom’s where she still lives, my 4 year old kept messing with the ornaments, I told him to stop several times, took them away. She got mad and almost cried, basically told me I’m ruining Christmas bc I don’t parent him and discipline him well enough. Ended up with her having a mental breakdown when I told her to stop screaming at him, and let me handle it. 
We didn’t talk for a few weeks.
Valentine’s Day this year, I spent with my kids over at my moms. My fiance was in the hospital. I wasn’t sharing that information with her or many people that day as it was going on. She let my son play on her iPad and left that day. As I’m putting a game on for my kid on the iPad I see a text come in from bf (27 year old, unemployed, bum man). Theyre both talking sh*t, she’s saying my fiance is a shit father for leaving me on valentines and he’s obviously f*cking some whore at a bar. That he’s a bad father for not spending today with his kids, and he’s agreeing. It was wrong for me to continue reading her texts with him after that, I’ll admit. But I was curious what else she had to say about me. It was ALOT. (Also, he’s never cheated on me, she had no reason to say something like that). They say a ton of shit about me, she says I can’t control my kids, she says I make my mom raise them (my mom watches them one day a week when my fiance and I are both at work, never any other time except then, no date nights nothing). She makes comments like I force her to watch them and I act like she has no life too (I never once asked her to watch the kids, I ask my mom when I need help- never her). She said to her bf on multiple different occasions that she feels bad for my son because he tells her he doesn’t want to go home when we leave my moms house- making it sound like he’s unhappy at home. He really says he doesn’t want to go home because he loves being at his grandmas house not because he’s unhappy at home. She says I’m being cheated on and I’m in denial but this little girl has NO PROOF. she talks bad about me going to work to her bf bc that means someone else is watching my kids other then me. They both sit home all day everyday unemployed, no school no education. She’s mad I went through her iPad but I did it because I saw her talking about me as it was going on. It was wrong of me yes but shocked what she thinks about me.. and then to tell lies like “she raises my kids” and “my sons unhappy at home” my kids are mine and my fiancés world and she’s making it seem like we are a toxic, unhappy family which is FAR from the truth, I honestly don’t understand why she’s doing this. Any thoughts? I can’t even talk to her without her screaming her head off and crying , so there’s really no point but as of now I don’t want her around my kids anymore or myself


Edit -My mom knows none of what she’s saying is true, and my fiance is aware also. I know this story kinda needs more background info, my sister and I were super close up until like two years ago, she got with her bf and I basically never see her anymore. I think she’s just unhappy with her relationship, her life, she’s quit her job since then, stopped going to school, does nothing but hangout with him.

1jemg94,AITA for cutting all my sisters off.,Maleficent-Coat-8092,"So I’m the youngest of five daughters. My three older sister are from a different dad that they really didn’t know their biological dad. My dad took care of them like they were his own. My one fully biological sister is a total mess. She for some reason has always been jealous of me. If I liked someone she would go after them. If I had something she wanted or she knew I really liked it she would steal it from me. She has even gone as far as to sleep with another guy I liked. When we were older and she visited me at my own place I caught her stealing my rent money and I cut her off for 10 years. 

Over that time I got married and had kids as did she. She married a drug user and he got super sick that he ended up in the ICU. She finally reached out and begged for me to go out of state and help her deal with her craziness. I few there and was there for a week helping take care of her husband and child. 

So fast forward whatever years later she moves close to us and they get evicted because instead of paying rent her husband was using the money for drugs. With a newborn and other small kids my husband and I rented a U-Haul and storage space to put their stuff in and moved them in with us. I kicked out her husband for smoking crack on my front porch. Weeks later he comes back “Clean” and she leaves with her son to be with him. We argued and didn’t talk for years again. 

While at my parents house they get a call from her crying that she’s homeless with her son and they are scared of her husband and need bus tickets to come home to them. They couldn’t afford it so I paid for them to travel multiple states to us. They stayed with us AGAIN. This time for 3 years! She hardly worked but I liked having family around and dealt with a lot of shit from her and it caused issues with my husband. I liked having someone to talk to. 

WelI I confided in her that when I was younger my older sister’s ex had SA me.  I never told anyone because she had a kid with him and I didn’t know how or what to do at such a young age.  So literally 10 plus years later my sister gets back with her Ex and everything is super awkward. I try to convince my sister to not get back with him cause he’s a loser and doesn’t deserve her but her confidence is shot and feels she can’t get anyone else. 

My sister finally moves out and starts talking crap about me to my other sisters. We fight and don’t speak and she tells my sister about the SA.   We all try to meet and talk things out and that when I find out that everyone knows about the SA. Because I kept it a secret and never told anyone my sister that’s with him doesn’t believe me and a huge fight breaks out. I left and told them all to go to hell and haven’t spoken to them since. My nephew and I was super close but know that I accused his father of SAing me he hasn’t spoken to me since. She has literally turned my sisters against me. I cut them all of from me and my family.

I made the argument why he expect us to emotionally support him when he never reached out and asked me if I’m okay when I’m in a bad mood. This made his so mad because apparently he believes that he has emotionally supported me before. So I asked him to give examples and he was about to get violent (this was all thought text and he said he’s about to break stuff at the gym). 

Just to keep the peace I just apologized because idk why I thought we can reasonably talk this out in a somewhat calm manner. 

He’s not neurotypical, I believe he has undiagnosed autism, but that doesn’t make his behavior okay. He’s almost 32 and hasn’t worked since 2020 and before that had a hard time keeping a job because of the social  aspects of working.

I’m extended out to him so many times and I’m getting so tired of his lack of gratitude for all his family does for him. Yea we grew up in a shitty environment but all my siblings were able move on and live our lives. And we all help to support our parents finances which includes him. 

I’d love to understand his perspective how he believes he’s emotionally supported anyone of us cause I could be wrong but it’s not worth if he can’t have a disagreement without getting violent.

Also once i was making scrambled eggs, i used two because i havent eaten anything for a while so i foreced myself too \[i may have a ed or its just anxiety its fine tho i will manage it\] and he said ""You rlly gonna eat all that?"" and then when i eat less or nothing he is like ""why dont you eat?"" and whenever i do eat with him he is like ""Oh my god \*weird smile and look\* you are actually eating my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\[petname ending thing its a language thing\] is eating."" He is also bearly home ever, and when he is he doesnt ever bother knocking anywhere. and when i shower he keeps comming back to the door, knocking and telling me to just get out even then im drying my hair or changing. like im not gonna leave naked..

also they \[my parents\] never really talk. only when absolute nessecery. and if they talk on vacation its prob when drunk and they fight most of the time or make passive agressive comments.

i dont know if im overreacting but i have a lot of anxiety and this adds to it and its making me hard to focus, especially for what my mom did. i keep thinking about it and its really bothering me.

i also posted this on [r/Vent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/) and [r/AdviceForTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/) but bearly anyone awnsered and im still thinking im over reacting and i dont know what to do",2,0,1742331179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jefmfe/is_that_normal_i_think_im_overreacting_but/
1jeesow,I'm somehow the only person in my family not allowed to have an opinion,One-Sandwich2149,"I (20F) live in a family of six: my mum (52f), stepdad (56m), and three brothers (my twin, 20, and 17m and 10m)

They're all very intense people. Like, if they have an opinion, they will die on that hill. I am very non-confrontational and tend to prioritize mediation and compromise over proving that I'm ""right""

For context, almost everyone in my household has either had experience with law or is studying that field. This makes me the oddball because I'm studying to be a veterinarian, the first in my entire family (that I know of...I have one cousin who is a pharmacist and a lot of my family have been cops)

If I even want to get one word in at all in discussions, I have to cut in before anyone else can speak. And then no one even regards what I say or tries to convince me I'm wrong. This is for any topic, even ones that I know I have the most knowledge in (specifically animals and their wellbeing...I am very in-tune with animals and can usually accurately predict that something is wrong)

But then I'm rude because I interrupted or got upset at something someone says to me.

A more specific example was when I was babysitting our dogs while everyone was gone. I'd given them a toy tire to play with to keep them occupied, and my stepdad came home and threw a fit because our younger dog, Buddy, had chewed it up. They're pitbulls...it's what they do. He'd put the half-chewed tire away and told me not to give it to them unless he was home so he could make sure they didn't eat the pieces. Fine, whatever. Except I had pointed it out to him that he never communicated with me that they weren't supposed to have that specific toy, and I *was* supervising them the entire time. My mum told me I needed to stop trying to start arguments, and I got frustrated and left the room

I don't really need advice, as I have a counselor I plan to talk to, I just really needed to get it off my chest. I feel so unwelcome in my own home, and I know if I bring it up, I'll get told to stop trying to be like my friends (even though they're all in happy, stable homes). I'm just really at the point of just never saying anything anymore.

Tl;dr: I am basically the outcast of my own family",1,1,1742329161.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jeesow/im_somehow_the_only_person_in_my_family_not/

1jdug7z,My BD wants to sign his rights over but wants to still be in my children's lives,Satoru-Gojo-2002,"So, I dated my baby daddy, his name is Gabe. When we had our first son, we were still together but shortly after my son's birth, we just couldn't keep being together. At the time, we were living with my mom, I was barely 18 and he was 19. She kicked him out because we had a very toxic relationship when he moved two and a half hours away, he barely had anything to do with our son, Cyrus. He barely wanted to reach out, he never helped out financially, he was just a very toxic person to be around. Gabe pulled me around saying he loved me and wanted me but then would turn around a few days later and say he didn't want me. 

  Fast forward, things stayed that way for the first two years of my sons life. Gabe acted like a POS and deadbeat, still being on and off with me. I ended up getting pregnant with my second son after going to visit Gabe (my idea, not his), and just some insight, I was off and on with my online boyfriend who was serving in the Marines, he was stationed in Japan. His name is Seth. We started dating off and on online when Cyrus was about three months old, yes... I regrettably was going between my ex and Seth. Seth would FaceTime everyday and talk to me and Cyrus both, he was committed to being there in any way he could. If I needed help financially, he would help me out and would send me money when I didn't have it since I had to be a stay at home most of the time at my mom's house. I couldn't hold a job because I couldn't get anyone to watch my son and daycare was too expensive. Not that Seth minded helping out when I needed help. Gabe never sent any help though and barely ever FaceTimed Cyrus. 

Seth came home a few months after finding out that I was pregnant with my second son, he was upset at first and didn't know how to feel. But once he got home, he came around to the idea of being a dad, even if this child wasn't his biologically since he was already considered ""dad"" to Cyrus. Gabe wanted me to abort my second son and told me multiple times that he only wanted Cyrus and he even told me to blame it on Seth and lie to everyone saying my second son belonged to Seth. Seth ended up moving in with me after he got discharged, he was there for my pregnancy, he was completely supportive, he was there for the birth of my second son, Aiden. He has been everything a dad can be to my two sons ever since he came into our lives. We've been together going on four years, we're getting married next month and we have a child of our own. Life is good for us.

Gabe is still a deadbeat, he likes to play the victim and tell people he has children and he's a single father even though he lives now four hours away and has nothing to do with his sons. He couldn't tell you their favorite color, what size clothes they're in, he couldn't tell you their medical history or anything. He is the definiton of a deadbeat. He's told me multiple times that he wants to sign his rights over because it would be better for the kids but at the same time he is demanding to still be apart of their lives after he signs his rights over and let's Seth adopt them. I don't know what to do because I don't see how that would be fair to Cyrus and Aiden in any kind of way, if you ""care"" or ""love"" your children you don't sign your rights over. You need to be there in their lives but he doesn't want to be a dad to them. He just wants to come around when it's convienent for him and only come around once or twice a year. It's very toxic. It's damaging to Cyrus and Aiden doesn't even know who he is, the only ""dad"" he has in his eyes is Seth. Need advice of what I should do. If he signs his rights over, I don't think I should allow him to be involved anymore.

1jdqs1i,Brother is a mess since day 1. But I want to help,CardiologistWarm1795,"My (25M) brother (31) has been an asshole since we were kids. He would always come hit me and be mean and all of that and when I would try to ask for help from my mom she would just say X stop hitting your brother, he never stopped. Even unprovoked he would do this every goddam day. After I was born no one ever did anything to set him some boundaries never hit him or scolded him or did anything to him and I suffered the consequences

I was always seen as the issue in everything that happened between us ecause whenever he would hit me or be mean and id retaliate he would get the sympathy of my parents and sometimes turn the whole family against me (my cousin still doesn'tspeak to me until now because of him). 
I'm also gay and it showed at multiple times during my childhood which i believe mixed with my rebellious nature had also turned my dad against me during my preteen years and during my teen years, all while my borther was treated so kindly and nicely and got so much help like first 2 cars for free as a gift from 2 different people from tbe family (he broke both of them) while I got nothing of that.

Then fast forward right now im the only master's degree earner of the family, i live abroad and have a well paying job while my borther got married and works in the army where he gets a very low salary and relies on my family's help which now can barely sustain jtself. He has a child a 3 year old girl. He left his wife and child in the rental home he has and he is living at my grand parents house with my grandparents.

No one is able to convince him to get back to them, his wife is a stay at home and her and her parents have done everything for my brother to be happy. My brother had a big argument with his wife at some point and sent her to her parents house all while she KNEW he was cheating on her but she never said anything about it so that she keeps her family together, her parents also know. But after he sent her back to her parents home with her child both of our families made them get back together but now he wants an out but he doesnt have money to divorce so they re separated. 

 I am thinking about my niece on how I can help her to have a better childhood than me because of this AH of a man who has already affected her negatively as now any time she hears a loud noise she starts saying NO NO NO and hits herself in dispair of having the situation resolved, I believe it is trauma that she endured from him screaming at her mom.

I dont know how to help while not being financially abused by him like the rest of the family where I would help him educating her while he spends his money on sex or going out with other girls. + it's only been 6 months since i graduated and found a well paying job.

Pls any recommendations! On how to best handle the situation and what to do and not to do??",1,0,1742253167.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jdqs1i/brother_is_a_mess_since_day_1_but_i_want_to_help/
1jdearh,Ready to Move Out Tonight (Advice Needed),Fun_Explorer1178,"Background: My (22F) older brother (24M) has never made good choices and has always been the golden child. Everyone including him calls me the family therapist because I'm always fixing their issues, and I am exhausted. This past 6 months things have gotten worse with him dating a new girl, proposing after a month, and getting her pregnant two months later. Everything in my home is changing and unfortunately like always I am taking the brunt of the changes. 

I am dating this amazing guy we will call Greg. Greg is an amazing man who I plan to marry, we have been together for 2 years now and have been discussing marriage more and more. Our 5-year plan included buying a home before we get engaged, we just closed on our home at the end of January. I initially wanted to wait to move in until we were legally married as my parents are very traditional. After the events of the weekend, I am considering moving in now and wanted advice on what is best. I spoke to Greg after we closed on the home, and he said he wanted me to live with him but understood why I was apprehensive. 

Weekend Events: 

Greg and I went out of town from Thursday-Saturday, just a short trip out of state to see a new area. When I got home Saturday Night, I noticed a lot of random junk was moved around the house. When I got to my room, I noticed some of my stuff I had stored in the spare room was thrown around my room. I guess they decided the spare room is going to be a nursery and instead of talking to me and asking me if i would move stuff they decided to do it for me. How sweet! Then I noticed my window open with an extension cord plugged in they decided to build a shelf and unplugged my mini fridge on Friday and everything in it (everything I use for packing lunches) was completely ruined.  I was super aggravated at this point and just wanted to go to bed but I couldn't find my charger. His fiancé decided she needed it and snagged it off of my bed. I am so done I'm ready to move out tonight when I get home from work. Someone please tell me I'm being dramatic here.

I was out of my mind worrying, as neither he nor his fiancee would answer my texts or calls.  Then my youngest daughter told me that he had sent her some strange texts.  The sum of the texts is that he loves my daughter, but he is not going to have any contact with me for a while.  Apparently he started therapy and says he did not grow up in a normal home, and that ""deep down"" I know what I did.  He says if he doesn't address this, he will kill himself!  The only thing I can think of that it may be is my ex-husband (his stepdad) was abusive to me mentally.  I own that I should not have exposed my children to this, but I was honestly not right mentally at the time, and isn't this something you would talk about with me before cutting me off first?

1jd5n49,Is My Brother Mentally Ill?,Traditional_Ear1249,"

Me(25M) and my brother (30M) had a relatively normal upbringing and were very close. My brother growing up was always a pretty chill guy, cool to hang to out with and a great sense of humor, but there was one thing, he had a dormant anger problem. He and our Dad (his stepdad) loved each other but definitely had plenty of issues through the years when it comes to discipline. He would challenge my our Dad’s authority sometimes and it would pose more of a problem the older we got. Eventually he went to the military but would get kicked out after a year for getting caught smoking weed. He moved back in with me and our parents for what I’m sure they thought would be a short time. He would bounce from job to job would eventually stop looking for work all together; much to our Dad’s dismay. Tension would build up between them while I was away at college, nothing ever went further than an argument. Our parent’s eventually decided that he either needed to find a place or move with our Grandmother who was living with us for a couple years, choosing the latter. He has been living with our grandmother for the past 3 years now and she never pressed him to go get a job or do much of anything. He has become reclusive and doesn’t speak a lot unless spoken to, and when he does talk sometimes he’ll say stuff that doesn’t make a whole lotta sense. His anger issues have become much worse in that timespan as well. One day he and my father finally came to blows after an argument in front of our Grandmother. He’s spent a night in jail for fighting a random stranger, has disrespected other family members and has even cursed out our mother who has done nothing but love and support him even after the issue with our Dad. Finally, yesterday I took him and our grandmother grocery shopping since he doesn’t have a car. After we left the store she wanted to me stop for some food, he started to get upset because he had some Ice Cream and was concerned it would melt even though the place we were going was a couple miles away. He screamed and cursed at me to let him out of the car…at a light in a busy intersection. I was completely stunned because he never spoke to me like that and over something insignificant was insane to me. He looked like he wanted to kill me in that quick instance before he walked off, my grandmother was also pretty unsettled by this. I fear his mental state is deteriorating, he used to be a very fit guy he’s lost weight and is skinny now and locks himself in a room and doesn’t talk to anyone. My mom has repeatedly try to set him up somewhere on his own but he keeps refusing to get a job and curses at anyone who tries to tell him what to do so it never works out. My Dad is basically done with him as well. I’ve been caught in the middle and I’m not sure what needs to be done here, I’m kind of nervous about him living with our grandmother now after seeing he can snap like that.

1jd3lk6,Why do I have to be the bigger person when my cousin acts weird with me???,No-Entertainment-876,"I (17F) geniuenely dislike it when my cousin (23M) gets handsy with me. 

  
For context: My cousin from my mom's side is a special needs, from what I've heard my aunt went in labor early (7 months) during her pregnancy with my cousin. One of the issues during his birth led to him having a needle through his eye or something?? as well as having a brain dysfunction I think. I kept asking my parents or relatives what his disability is but they keep saying that ""there's something wrong with his brain"" their words not mine, because of this everyone from my mom's side pampers , coddle and baby him. Emphasis on BABY 'cause I'm not joking the way they talk to my cousin is exactly how one would talk to a toddler with ""\*Cousin's name\* don't do that! that's bad!"" and stuff like that. But it's not the reason why I came here to reddit, it's mostly because of how my cousin gets ""physically affectionate"" with me and how my family brushes me off. 

  
My cousin has this weird habit of sniffing my hair at random times and sometimes he touches my thighs and it makes me uncomfortable. I also told some stories to my friends and when they told me how weird it was. that was when I realized my cousin has done some weird things and my family enables him sometimes. One of these incidents is that up until I was 12-13? my cousin has this weird tendency to only pull up his shorts/pants outside bathroom. because of this I've grown used to seeing my cousin's weiner out and when I mentioned this to my mom she told me it was in the past and to pardon my cousin cause he's a special case. 

  
I just hate how when my cousin acts out, they just either let him or  scold him lightly and if he doesn't listen they just don't bother. I've witnessed countless of times of my cousin acting out and breaking things from glass tables, glass doors and etc and this kind of led me to grow paranoid over the years and up until I was 15 right after quarentine, he's been randomly appearing behind me to sniff my hair, and whenever we sit next to each other (example: sitting next to each other in the car) he'll just caress my thigh and whenever I tell him to stop that my aunt or mom just tell me to stop and let him be or in my mom's case pinch me on the arm/waist",3,0,1742182270.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jd3lk6/why_do_i_have_to_be_the_bigger_person_when_my/
1jczqc7,I’m i the asshole for wanting to go no contact and move to a different state when I’m 18?,Ok_Math4545,"Me 12f have never really hated my family. It started when I was 9. My mom 34f let my grandma 65f move in. Worst decision she could ever make. My grandma is very abusive. In every way possible. She’ll hit me for things I didn’t do and talk bad about me every loud just so I can hear it. She’ll say stuff like “Why can’t she be more like her sister she’s useless” or “That abusive bitch is never going to be anything in life she a good for nothing bitch!” To the whole family. She makes lies about me to tell the whole family about how I’m useless and abusive. Which every time I heard something about me that’s bad I cry because it hurts when you hear your own family say stuff like that. My mom isn’t much help she’ll join in with my grandma and believe every word she says. 

If I told you the amount of times I’ve thought of doing something to myself because of those comments you would be surprised. 

I can’t run away because I have a big family and my mom has lots of friends that we’ll probably see me and tell my mom. And I try to stay away from home every chance I get which is at school since my mom doesn’t let me go out by myself. So I have to wait till I’m 18 to leave the family. One time I think it was about a month ago I told my mom how I’m planning to leave the state as soon as I’m 18 and my mom didn’t like that. We started fighting which led me to being grounded. The reason I’m writing this now though is because I’m getting tired of being treated like this. 

Me and my family were staying in NJ with my uncle 39M for his birthday when I heard them talking about me. Saying really bad stuff about me which I rather not say because it makes me cry again. I mean I don’t know why they talk bad about me when I’m trying my best but don’t talk about my little brother 7m who stills poos his pants. And somehow it’s my fault he doesn’t know how to use the bathroom they say “if you helped more with your siblings he would’ve known when to use the restroom.” I think because of this week I’m going to start being a teenager earlier. I’m not going to damage my reputation in school but I’ll might start leaving the house without permission because I don’t think I can stay there for more then ten minutes without my grandma talking shit about me.

1jcvv4w,My parents killed my cat without telling me,Past-Start-8305,"A few months ago, I called my parents to see how they were. I live abroad. 
As we get chatting, I ask how everyone is, the rest of the family, the cats, the dogs (one of which, Ariel, was given to me as a teenager). 
Out of nowhere, I'm told she had an eye infection, which resulted in her eye being removed. 
And then they tell me that because she was in pain, they had to have her put to sleep. 
Mind you, this is my cat. I live abroad, so she lives with my parents and they take care of her and all the other family pets we have. 
I lose my shit. I explain boundaries to my parents again like I have many many times and explain that I'm 20-something years old and I'm not to be treated like a child, nor decisions like such made without telling me.
My mom tells me she ""didn't want to upset me"" and she's sorry. 
Today, months later, Ariel comes up in the conversation again, but this time in person, while I'm visiting my family. 
I find out that my Dad was in the US, so my mother took Ariel to the vet. 
(Side note: my mom does not deal with animals or people passing away well. At all. She gets physically sick). 
So I ask my mom what really happened. 
Turns out: they put her down because there was a neighbour cat bothering her and they didn't want that anymore. 
Apparently it didn't occur to them to keep her indoors. 
It gets worse. 
My poor Ariel was alone when she was put to sleep. 
My mom, being the way she is, and my dad in the US, and me being abroad, not having a clue any of this was going on, left the poor cat likely scared out of her mind and lonely when she left this world for no good reason. 
Im 27. I've been crying the whole evening. 
What's worse is they have been saying sorry to me all evening, bringing me flowers, a plate of food, a new water bottle, making sure my bedroom is heated. 
I don't want any of it. 
I'm heartbroken, disgusted, livid and actually just done.

She has always been so cold specifically toward me as I was protective of my siblings and I’m the eldest. I lived with her and my dad for a few years growing up / she treated me like I was an alien in the household and never spoke to me or gave me the time of day unless it were to do with disclipine ( my dad never stood up to that role) but would let her verbally abuse me and belittle me, leading me almost to suicide(which he was aware of, but blamed me of being mentally unstable at 12, and refused to see any other contributing factors. Since now I’m an adult, my dad refuses to allow me to come over to visit my other siblings when they come over to visit ( as him and my mum are divorced and they take turns with kid visits) he excludes me, as it’s easier for him to not include me ( saves him the headache fighting with my stepmum about me) my stepmum doesn’t like me and is the contributing factor of a wedge between mine and my dad’s relationship. I’ve given him so many chances to show up for me ( through the abuse, and now that I’m an adult and willing to meet up with him and visit his place) but he avoids it. I apologised to my stepmum for our rocky past as per my dad’s request which i was reluctant to do anyway as she was highly abusive and horrible on numerous occasions without any fair reasoning) and she still hasn’t met me half way or make an effort. When I last saw her at a family members house her and my dad showed up at - she completely ignored me and didn’t even look at me. I brought this up with my dad and he denied knowing anything about it .. I’m so over the constant disrespect and let down. 

 I love my dad but he can’t seem to move forward without his wife’s approval of me , what do I do?",2,1,1742124674.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jcjgnj/nasty_step_mum_causing_problems/

1jcity6,I have caused my half-siblings great upset because I keep rejecting them,,"As the title says. I have two half-siblings that my father pro-created after he abandoned my mother, my sister and me. I'll give as much of the backstory as I need to so you can have a fair idea.

My father was a drunk and physically abusive to my mother and me, he was also serially unfaithful to my mother and I believe had several children out wedlock with waitresses, barmaids, air stewardesses etc.

He eventually left for good and left us penniless, moved back to his home country to avoid paying child support or alimony. In the overlap of all this he got remarried and had two children with his new wife - a girl and a boy.

I lived with his new family briefly because my mother was unwell having secretly attempted suicide because of all this, but I came back after a few months. My father's decision to cut off us financially was partly down to his new wife, who didn't want him to spend anything on us.

This is all about 25 years ago. Recently, those two other children have been trying through various social media platforms to contact me. They would be in their early twenties and are both living in London, as do I. I'm relatively successful in my career, I have been on TV numerous times talking about matters relevant to my industry, which they have apparently noticed.

I keep rejecting them as I want nothing to do with my past. I've heard that my father is a completely new man, has dried out and has been a stable, loving influence to them.

I couldn't care less about any of that, to me he will always be a monster and his new children are just a reminder of that. I routinely block them whenever they initiate contact and have made it clear through various other relatives that they will never be welcome in my life, nor is anyone from my father's side from back then. This has by all accounts caused them a great deal of distress as they want to get to know me and don't understand why I won't. I believe that my sister has some sort of bond with them and keeps our father's past a secret to protect their image of him.",3,3,1742122057.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jcity6/i_have_caused_my_halfsiblings_great_upset_because/

1jcghex,How to deal with a mom who's deeply insecure,wishing_well_cluster,"25M here from somewhere in Asia, and I'm still living with my parents as a single child.

Since I was a kid, I've always had to deal with my mom. She's a foreigner, and moved to my country with my dad after I was born. 

After coming to to this country, she refused to work, saying that her English was terrible, and refusing to learn any English or make more friends here, hence becoming a housewife. She took good care of me and my dad, so I respect her decision and I'm grateful for her.

All along, however, she had always been victimising herself, insisting that she was scammed to come to our country with my dad, and left her with no choice but to become a housewife and ruining her life, hence refusing to work, maintaining that it was impossible due to her English, and refusing to take any steps to improve her own life, even though she deeply laments her financial situation and exhibits very deep financial insecurity. My dad has always allowed her to spend any money she wants. Thankfully, she's thrifty. Often times excessively so, to the point on skimping on hawker centre meals or simple luxuries well within our means.

As I've grown up and slowly become independent, it's evident that she has become increasingly insecure. She often mentions how filial my cousins (living in her home country) are, even though they stay away from their parents and only visit home once every few months. Yet, me staying with her every day seems to be the villain and not filial enough, often insinuating using my cousins, despite taking time almost every day to talk to her, eat with her and help her with what she needs. 
She also very often complains how I'm not listening to her, about how my ""wings have gotten hard"", and that I don't need her any more. Even as a kid, whenever something doesn't go her way, she'd always threaten ""Then I'll leave!"". Of course, this is the tip of the iceberg. Frankly, as an adult, I can still find the trauma she's left in me in every part of my life.
Back during COVID, she spent a lot of time complaining that my dad and I weren't following her unreasonably strict, sometimes outright paranoid hygiene rules, and some of that continues even today!

We went for a family trip last year, which, for the most part, became very ugly due to her and my dad bickering over very petty things and ruining most of the joy. (Both my parents were in the wrong for the most part.) This year, I decided that I'd travel alone, and I told my parents about it. They weren't opposed to it initially (they probably know I really want to do this and don't really care), and I booked the trip anyway. Subsequently, she asked for which dates I'm going and I told her, to which she has been throwing a huge tantrum, chastising me for not consulting with her and abandoning her for the trip. I can't understand why I have to consult her for my own travels using my own money. 
She compared me to a cousin, who rarely every goes home at all, but recently asked her mom for the first time ever whether she'd like to go overseas for a trip together.

I spoke to her sister, my aunt, who's far more reasonable, and she believes that it's her deep insecurity rearing an ugly head, based on what she knows of my relationship with my mom. She knows how oppressed I've ever felt due to my mom.

Thanks for reading this rant. If you've got any advice on what I should do, I really appreciate it.",1,1,1742111401.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jcghex/how_to_deal_with_a_mom_whos_deeply_insecure/
1jcfg7q,MY FIRST COP CALLING EXPERIENCE AND I WANNA HATE MY MOTHER,Much-Worth-1225,"I am 17 years old and have three siblings. Ever since I was a child, my parents have fought constantly. My mom drinks a lot, and her friend, whom I hate, is always with her.

Three days ago, she went out with that friend on my younger sibling’s birthday, which frustrated me. Yesterday, she went out again because my father was also out drinking with his friends.

Last night at midnight, my younger sibling messaged me, saying they were hungry, but both parents were absent. I live with my grandma, so I couldn’t go to them and just told them to sleep. I called my mother multiple times. Her friend answered but claimed my mom had gone home, which I doubted. When I checked with my sibling, she still wasn’t home. I called again, but her friend ignored me. I left messages but got no response.

At 4 AM, my drunk father showed up at my grandma’s house because my mom had called the cops on him. I don’t know why, but they let him go. Meanwhile, I got another message from my sibling saying my mom was back—drinking with her friend again.

At 6 AM, I went home. The house was a mess, and my second sibling hadn’t slept. I told my mom’s friend to leave, but she refused, saying, “You don’t care.” I was furious. I tried waking my mom, but she just opened her eyes and went back to sleep. I threatened to call the cops if her friend didn’t leave. She said, “Okay.” So I called. The police took her, but before leaving, she said, “We will meet again.” She is a PE teacher at my school.

While I was cooking, my dad woke my mom up, and they started fighting again. My siblings began crying. After it settled, my two siblings and I went out for a while. When we returned, my mom was at the door, saying she had gone to buy juice. I was suspicious and told my sibling to go with her. Later, my sibling told me she ran off and got into a car—her friend’s car again.

We tried calling her, and she said she was going to another country. I don’t know what to feel. I want to hate her, but she is my mother. I feel so bad for my siblings. They are too young for this.

My parents have been fighting since I was a kid, through middle school, and now, as I near adulthood. It never stops. I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends about it, so I’m just seeking advice and emotional support.

1jcf25o,Neglectful and rude family,1starllight1,"So I haven't been living at home due to my family's behavior, I'm only 16 and I am my grandfather's full time caretaker ATP. I live at his place part time and offer to take care of him to get away from my horrid family. My family consist of my older sister, my younger brother, his dad, my mom , and his dad's mther + 4 cats & a husky. I have never been respected in this house. I come home every week or 2 to pick something up or just to stop by, every time I come home my stuff is tampered with or ruined. In the 8th grade I had spent a week at a family members house for fun, when I had gotten home my bed was gone , my bedframe had been given to my younger brother and where my bed was previously a recliner had token its place. I had gotten in troublefor getting mad that my bed was gone and forced to sleep in my mom's bed with her. I had to wait months till Christmas so I would have to money to buy myself a bed and I did. Since highschool has started my health began to decline so I started online school so I was able to go to my grandad's to take care of him. While I did so I would still come home half of the week every time something was done to my part of me n my siblings room. Trash on my bed, people putting laundry on my bed, my anime figures being broken , money being stolen, things going missing. It's been like this ever since but this Wednesday I had come home after being gone for 2 weeks. I had come to just pick up some packages and spend a night or 2 till I went back to my grandad's little did I know that when I would go to chill in my bed there would be a huge wet mark. My sister's cat had knocked something into my bed causing mold to grow. My sister had known it was there and left it to mold. She had said it was my fault cuz it's my bed. Now my mattress is moldy and has to be thrown out. I don't have the funds to replace it either. This is the 4th time I had come home to something wrong with my bed it was originally just her cat had pissed on it , then a huge mystery stain that refused to lift, now this. I do everything in this house when I come home I clean the living room , dining room, & bathroom. This includes mopping, cleaning cat boxes, and more.  I get no respect for this everyone still complains I do nothing for the house. Even though when I come home no one has cleaned since I left. And ofc the adults it the house don't care. I'm genuinely so tired of living in such ways. I pay for everything I own clothing, beds, essentials. I don't know what I can even do anymore, I'm too sick to work and I can't anyway cuz my mom will lose her benefits. That's all my mom cares about her money and her stupid boyfriend.

4 yrs ago she got preg by a guy in jamaica had my nephew. Brought BIL over got married. Still live at home in her childhood bedroom all 3 of them. I shared the bathroom with them, it was a shitshow. They both were unpleasant, didnt clean didnt wash their dish ect. Abused my parents generosity with babysitting.
Thankfully ive moved out.

Now sis is preg again, and takes full advantage of my parents in many ways. Unstable moods.

I cant stand her over the years, but sometimes shes nice and i feel guilty, but the mood swings come up its conflicting.

BTW years back sis took MY old sewing machine to give to BIL when he lived in jamaica. Its been gone ofc but i never said anything cause i wanted to he the bigger person.

Sis calls me today livid asking me where sewing machine is demanding that i bring it back by the end of the month that its his sewing machine. Texts me too to pay them $200 if i want to keep it. It retails $80.

1jcdelq,Unhappy negative forever bitching MIL,Worth_Put9918,"Hey everyone, 

I need to know how or when does this end. My MIL is not a nice person, I sincerely mean this. She doesn’t have a good heart. 

She’s a negative Nancy, unhappy, extremely selfish, consistently finding problems with everyone and everything every single day! 

She has an undying need to bitch about every little thing and every little person, and the best part is she thinks she’s subtle about it, but man all of us can read her so well. 

Particularly with her daughter in law, she’s possessive about the kitchen, house hold items, constantly hating on what I wear, doesn’t pay for my groceries, doesn’t even put away a packed of food if I’ve ordered it. Hates sharing linen for the room, general bathroom mats she’s possessive about, hoarded everything in her life, hides everything from incense sticks to safety pins. Food, nuts, coffee next level treasure hunt. Gets food made for her self but can’t tolerate spending a penny on her own son. Thinks she knows everything and honestly thinks the world is centred around her, ugh. Pretends and believes to be extremely giving, spiritual and caring - but is the complete opposite unfortunately.

She’s extremely calculative, once she told me that ice cream I ordered was too expensive and made her son pay her 350 rs for the FAMILY pack lol 

So greedy, so selfish, never seen anyone like her. She’s so old, yet I’ve never seen anyone as immature as her. 

I want to be away from her, formal and door se namaste is what I’d like with her, however we live in the same house and for my husband’s sake I’ve found my way of living happily at home. 

I quite enjoy everything else about family life except this sweet mother in law of mine. 

Advice? 

Taking to her and confronting her never goes well, she gets too personal and honestly I don’t think she absorbs anything, ego awakens and it’s just mind games after. 

However I’m oscillating between letting her know that I know what she says about me, the question is does it matter? 

How do I navigate this hate hate relationship! Jokes apart, I’m starting to feel indifferent towards her and there’ll be no going back.

The little feelings I have left are from remembering the good things she’s also done in the past. It’s getting difficult holding on to that though. 

I don’t want an aota in my body to get affected by her, she’s a true waste of space, time and energy in my world.

Our relationship was ended in November last year due to series of abuse from his side and now there’s a DVO in place to protect me from his abuses. 
I came to spend some time with my family to help me getting through this difficult period, we do not have parenting orders in place he is currently paying child support and recently he has decided he wants to video call our son on a daily basis which is very stressful for myself due to everything that happened. 
In the last couple of weeks he is being very difficult, he advises the time he is going to call and I get my son ready to talk to him and when time comes he doesn’t show up, he just turns off the phone and leave him there waiting for him, a month ago I had to take him to the hospital after trying to call him a few times to let him know about the situation and ask him to send his child support(which was late) so I could pay for the hospital expenses he not only didn’t pick up the phone but also txted me saying he was with a friend and would only call in 3 hours. 
My son is only 1 year old but he is very cleaver(such a good boy) he can speak and make calls already and every time he calls his father he just ignores the calls and turns off the phone saying he is too busy and some time later he demands to speak to him and when I refuse to answer his calls he says that I’m getting between them and keeping him from contacting his son. 
He is a narcissist who only cares about himself and is extremely abusive and manipulative; he even got his mother to message me accusing me of ignoring his calls and keeping him from talking to our son. 
The thing is, the inconsistency of his calls is making my son very sad, this morning he even cried,  his constant messaging demanding to speak to him only when he wants is giving anxiety and causing stress only. Is there any law that makes me keep answering his calls? Because I just can’t keep doing this, it’s just too much.

1jbmj6c,Problems With an Adult Son Who Still Acts Like a Child,Remote-Revolution577,"I hope I am in the right place to ask this question.

  
I have a 26-year-old son who my wife and I have supported for his entire life. We paid for him to go to school, for four years, and yet he graduated with only an ""Associate's Degree"" from a four-year school. I worked a large portion of his life so he could have a stay-at-home Mom.

He's still at home. We have asked him to contribute to the family, especially now that I am not working, and trying fo find another job. He has done this, but not without a lot of resentment and anger.

My wife and I have been supporting every aspect of his life, until the past few years. He is now a grown man. Now that we need his help, he is bossy, resentful, aggressive, and negative. His anger is sometimes frightening. 

I worked a huge chunk of my ""prime income years,"" for the sole purpose of enabling him to be at home with his Mom. This required a lot of sacrifice on my part. I took high-paying jobs, in far-flung places. 

My adult son still acts like a child. For his entire life, he has interrupted both me and my wife when we are on the phone. That is perhaps acceptable when the child is six, but not 26. It's embarrassing when he slams doors, screams obscenities, and is generally disruptive. It's hard to explain to the other people on the call why this is happening. (""Oh, he's only joking."" That's my go-to excuse.)

No, I have not been a perfect parent. But yes, I have done the best that I could do.

It is demeaning and hurtful to me that he does not understand the sacrifices that were made for him to get to where he is now. And yes, now that we are in need of his support, I am angered by his hostiity.

This is the perfect example. When he was perhaps 7 years old, we took him to a sporting goods store to buy him an expensive pair of hockey skates. He would not sit still to be fitted. He was squirmy, and frankly obnoxious. The teenage clerk who was helping us said to him, ""If my parents were buying me a $1,000 pair of skates, I think I could sit still to get measured.""

In a nutshell, this is the son we have raised. We need his help now that I (especially) am in transition to a new job. All I ever get from him is lip. I have to close the door to my home office, and send a warning text for him not to talk, scream, or slam the wall when I am on the phone for work. It's ridiculous that I must take these kinds of precautionary measures with a grown man.

I forgot to mention that he plays video games almost constantly. He gets so involved in these, he has punched a hole in the wall on two occasions.

I've really had it with him -- but I can't leave, because my wife and I are depending (financially) on him at the moment.

I really want to explain to him how he has been supported this far, and point out how ungrateful he seems. (At least to me.) My wife does not want me to do this, because she says it was our responsibility, and we should not ""throw this in his face.""

I am trying to make the best of this situation until something changes. In the meantime, I am stuck. Sometimes I consider walking away from it all, but the fact is,. I have nowhere to go.

I am not trying to paint a picture of me as a saint, and likewise, he is not a total villain.

All of us are in a tough spot.

Prior to having our first, we mutually agreed we will not be forcing relationships on our kids regardless of the title to our kids. My partner group texted his mom and siblings(30F and 26M) saying how he was disappointed in their involvement with our oldest when she was a few months old. It ended with his family agreeing they could do more and wanting to do more for our daughter. Fast forward about a year, we all got together for a birthday dinner and his brother claimed we all mutually agreed to get brunch the next day. We had no recollection of the conversation. Another side note, it was Mother's Day this is quite important in my opinion. Well me and my partner went out for breakfast/brunch with his uncle and aunt. Two months pass by and the brother got into an argument with my partner and their uncle about us going out to eat without him. My partner and their uncle apologized and stated we had no clue there were plans of us all getting together for brunch, which we were 100% unaware. 


This specific argument turns into me being called a bad mom and his brother blaming me for him not having a relationship with our daughter. I end up getting into an argument with the brother's girlfriend and I ended up just blocking everyone and leaving it behind me. This also turned into my partner going no contact with his brother and sister. During this time, his sister began excluding me out of ""family"" group chats.

1jbg5gm,Parents activities at night (vent),NicknameBarIsBroken,"Around the beginning of this year my parents started to have more sex. I often stay up late without them knowing, on that point it's my fault. And even there I was fine, it's normal for them to do it from time to time, they close the door and do their stuff. But then they made multiples days where every night they were doing that.
It began to grow on me and I start to hate it, just hearing them makes me disgusted and hate them (temporaly).

I went to the extent where bursting loud music in my ears is something I find better than hearing them fuck

And I feel like they're not making any efforts now. We went to bed all at the same time tonight and they closed their door and immediatly began to fuck. Are they freaking nut? I'm not someone that just lie down and is asleep ten sec after, they know that and they just casualy do it. What is wrong with them? And I'm pretty sure I heard them doing it earlier in the shower (in the bathroom that is quite litteraly right next to my bedroom) when it wasn't night yet, and I was in my room.
And ten minutes ago I snapped and began to throws stuff on my door to make noise and just pass the message of ""hello! Could you shut up? I'm still awake, I'm active!""

I'm even wondering if I shouldn't just hand some of my saved money with a note to ask them to buy insolation pannels and stop having me hear everything. I'm starting to really despise them on that matter. Which really hurts me since I actually love them, they are good parents but right now they are going too far and they disgust me... And it's also having a negative impact on my view of love.

I don't know what I could or should do.",2,0,1741991112.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jbg5gm/parents_activities_at_night_vent/
1jbdbi9,Advice how can I improve my relationship with my youngest sister,HiCat8321,"Hi. Just want to rant out about my family issue. I'm so stress lately. If someone could give me advice on how to solve this issue I would be very thankful. Sorry if this is long. 1st of all I am infj. I will be straight to the point.

Me and my older sister looks like we both cut off our relationship already. We always argue since we were kids. Now reaching almost 30, we just do our own things and never talked and this year marked our 1 year and half not talk to each other after our big fight last year.

My sister is an ocd person. She have this bossy personality every single day and I really cannot tolerate who likes to be bossy and always yapping at anything every single time. That's trigger me to quarrelled with her.

Second story, I have one youngest sister who I really love. I took care of her since she was a baby whenever I was at home. Our age gap is big so ofcourse I love her because I am the youngest before. Currently she is in 1st year of high school. I took care of her every single time when I was at home. I always make childish jokes like a child whenever I was at home eventho I'm an adult. So last year we both quarrelled then day after I want to apologise to her but she just stay quiet. Then after a week I try again. Suddenly, I started to realised why my youngest sister suddenly became stubborn to forgive me (before this not like that). After a month I try again and almost everyday for months I apologise to her directly and even buy her things like her birthday presents etc. I even cried my eyes out back then because I felt so sad my youngest sister who I love very dearly do not want to speak to me anymore. My parents sometimes always give judgemental advice like I always teased her but I said I apologise already and I never cursed her or what. I feel sad until now because last 2 years when my parents went to pilgrimage for 7 weeks, I am the one taking care of her. I even cooked her every single meal if she requested (I am free at that time because I took leave for postgraduate study), pick her up from school everyday, when she heavily sick of fever, flu and phlegm I even take care of her at night (every single night) and full of medicines I bought just to make sure she's fine (I always pity her and feel restless whenever she's sick) and etc. Her beloved sister (one that I quarrelled until now) never took care of her during that 7 weeks. Ofcourse she went to work but during weekend, I get angry and told her how come u said u love ur sister but never care for her when she's sick on weekend. She always yapping and claiming she's the good one about her buying food and stuff to the youngest but she never care for her when she's sick. And it makes me sad because the youngest love her. I feel so so so sad because my youngest until now never thought of how I was being so kind to her. I even broke down so bad crying like a child of how my relationship with my youngest sister ended now so many times. I'm now at the age of getting married. And every single time when I look back at old photos of me and my youngest sister it broke my heart so so so bad.

I told my youngest sister ""Did you resent me because I quarrelled with ur beloved sister?"" And She just quiet. I told her ""You should not get involved with my issue with ur sister because we both always quarrelled since we were kids. Nothing can save that. These things happened even before u were born."" But as always she just quiet. Deep down in my heart I could sense my youngest hate me. I don't know why she hate me. My personality always act of service to people I love and this hurt me so much. I even helped my youngest sister when she was a kid she stuck her finger near sardine can cap and I helped her eventho there were my parents and her beloved sister. I quickly went to help her when I heard her cry so loud. Ends up my finger bleed so much after helping her with that sardine cap because I got scraped with that can. I don't know from who I could get help. I don't want to improve my relationship with my sister but I just want to be friend with my youngest sister back. It broke me every single day living in the same house where u want to play childhood games and chatting with ur sister but nothing the same anymore. My mom even cried sometimes because youngest do not want to friend with me anymore. I cried so loud like a kid in front of my mom ""It's already 1 year. When she want to talk to me."" My dad always say ""be patience."" I said it's already a year. ""Then what? After she turns 20? I'm already old. Who knows when I will get married in future."" I cried so loud because I keep thinking I won't have any recent memories with her anymore. My youngest did not even remember why she so angry with me until today. I even said I will buy her favourite things to her if she forgive me but she did not budged. Deep down I think her beloved sister brainwash her not to friend with me anymore. Mark my words she's a gaslighting person. The worst one. I even caught her message my youngest sister when we went back to hometown (she cannot follow because of work). She asked her ""is she talking to you? U friend with her?"" When I came back to our home at city, I shouted so loud in front of her face ""Why meddle with my issue?(with my youngest) u gaslight her behind my back?"" My sis just stay quiet. I told her once more I caught you, you know what I will do. Because I never meddle with her life. After a year now I feel so miserable with my postgraduate study, with my parents attitude (my dad always scolding me or talk harshly even when I talk kindly), and my sadness of my youngest sister not friend with me anymore. If someone could give me advice how I want to be friend with her back. Even writing this I cry so bad again. Note: my argument with my youngest sister back then was just like child argument like quarrelled over ice cream that kind of level. Not like adult level) T.T Even until now evetho she don't speak to me I sometimes helped her to buy food whenever my parents not at home. I even make small talk everyday but ofcourse she didn't answer. It's like I'm talking to a wall. This week I even buy birthday card with music and gift to my youngest sister because it's her birthday soon. I am planning to write down sincere nice words to her if she want to be my friend again. But I don't know anymore if I should do that. T.T I'm afraid I will be broken so hard if she just stay like that even after giving her birthday card with music. I cried saying why am I taking care of her back then? (Deep in my heart I love her so much and it broke my heart. I'm crying and thinking why I take care of her so much if it end up like this.)

He’s deleted me off Facebook and socials but will still call me and FaceTime everyday and talk about our days and stuff. He has ex’s and people he doesn’t even like still friends with him on there but not me? I recently had twins and moved in with my fiancé about a year ago. Not sure if it’s resentment for moving out? He messaged me hurtful words and comments last week when I mentioned to our parents he removed me and I was quite upset and hurt about it. It seemed unprovoked. Any advice or tips?

He has had to wear a catheter since oct, he will have surgery on his prostate on 4/4. He also has rheumatoid arthritis from head to toe. He has fallen 4 times trying to use the bathroom. My mom couldn’t get him up so the fire dept had to. Twice he was taken to the hospital for it. He had a hand injury one time and another time 3 broken ribs. He is in desperate need of a taller toilet and a lift chair. He cannot get out of his chair. I normally do not ask for help, i’m the one always helping. But right now I cannot do very much. I am paying for my daughter’s wedding and the engine went out in my hubbys truck. My dad is also an Army Vet. Medicaid will not pay for these items. I love my dad so very much. I feel helpless. I also want to have someone take out the bathtub and install a handicap shower. I have no idea the cost on something like that. He also has a pacemaker and defibrillator. It’s so hard seeing him sit still. He was always on the go. He has not been able to do his infusion for his arthritis because of the infections he keeps getting. Anyway, sorry for the book. But if you can help, that would be great, if not that is okay too. Even a $1.00 would help. Thank you for listening- Cindy

1jayd4m,Relationship with Sister,True_Jeweler_1106,"Hello, I don't know if I posted in the right topic but I just need advice because I don't know what to do. My sister and I in out 20s. I am the older one out of the both of us

Our relationship has always been in waves of bad and good moments. I am not affectionate with her. I'm not sure why but I just never been one to hug her often or say I love you often. However, I am always there for her when she needs help or wants me to just hear her out. She does put a lot of effort in our relationship but struggle to do the same. So much so it frustrates her. 

I don't want to get into too much detail because she does go on Reddit and I don't want her to know about this post. 

We used to argue like regular siblings but I feel like it has been becoming a bit much lately.

I know I should try to be the bigger person since I'm older but sometimes my emotions get the better of me. Sometimes she says/does certain things and it causes me to defensive which in turn causes her to be more defensive. I try to remove myself from our arguments because of my unstable emotions. I often need to get myself out of that situation so I can let my emotions ride out/calm down and I can try to think with a clear head regarding what happened. The last thing I want to do is hurt her

Whenever our arguments escalate, she tells me that I am the cause of our arguments getting worse. She says I always try to be in the right in our arguments. She tells me I try to make her look bad or that I always have a bad attitude with her.

I do admit that recently I think I am the cause of our fights getting intense and it's because I haven't been backing down. She sometimes picks unnecessary fights and creates something out of nothing.


I feel like always do wrong in her eyes whenever we argue. I can't defend myself. I can't tell her what she said was hurtful, I can't leave the argument to try to collect myself. If someone is in the middle of our argument and if they show their on my side in the slightest then they are also in the wrong and they're enabling me to treat her bad. 


She always tells me that I am the favorite when it comes to my older siblings and parents. How she is always in the wrong in their eyes. How they enable me to be horrible towards her.

Idk, maybe what she's says about me is true?? I'm not best person. I have my flaws and I wish I reflected back the same affection she has for me. I am stumped on what to do.

I am trying not to fight back in our arguments but it's a bit hard for me to hold back lately. I feel like it's mostly fights instead of good memories. 

I do try to talk to her about it but it just ends up in an argument. Either she doesn't agree with what I say or hear me out. Or, I say something that sets her off. 

Is it me? Should I just seek help or idk...something. 

Also, I'll probably delete this post later. I really don't want her to see it because I feel like another argument will happen. 

Any criticism or advice is helpful. Maybe I'm just not seeing what she is seeing. ",1,0,1741937312.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1jayd4m/relationship_with_sister/

I, 24F, grew up on my bio father’s side being the first grandchild. *I say bio father because we haven’t consistently spoken in almost 10 years. story for another day. It was always known that he was adopted but my brother and I never asked questions. When I was 14, we drove all the way to TX from the northeast. I met my biological aunt for the first time since I was a child. the family dropped hints as to what happened but I never caught on. she sat me down and said “your *insert great-grandma’s name* was a hoe”. Turns out, while the man who I knew as my great grandpap since birth was actually a saint. while he went to fight in WWII, my great grandmother had an affair. he came back to a pregnant wife, stayed with her, had several kids together, and raised him as his own. My fraternal grandfather was a bastard child. One of his half siblings adopted my bio father so my “grandma” is my half great aunt. Later I was told that my fraternal grandmother was a r@cist pos and that my mom wasn’t allowed to name me exactly what she wanted because it coincidentally contained a name that my fraternal grandmother goes by. I’m actually the second youngest grandchild on the biological side, my brother being the youngest. anywayssssss, I never considered looking for my fraternal grandparents….until now. I found my grandmother’s Facebook and saw her photo for the first time. I never thought I looked like anyone in my family until I saw her face. I see that she has a few family members as mutual friends but I don’t speak to any of them (my bio father being one of them). I sent her a request days ago and it went unanswered. I just cancelled it. Last I heard about my fraternal grandfather, he was in WA with a Native woman and two children, a boy and a girl. allegedly I have handfuls of half aunts/uncles from his journey up north. who knows what’s true and what’s not. they all cheat on each other and cover up shady shit. that’s why my parents are divorced. I guess what I’m asking is, do I try to connect with my grandmother? should I try to find my grandfather? my maternal grandfather died in 2016 and I can’t even say that I enjoyed him as a person. my maternal grandmother was my favorite person to walk the earth. she passed in 2021. I still cry when something reminds me of her. my relationship with my half great aunt is strained because I have really cut ties with my bio father in recent years. advice?

1jav9r0,mom hates when I clean,Spiritual-Pay-7732,"My mom and I have lived in the same house for 20 years basically my whole life. The house has random messes different places, but as I've gotten older I like things cleaner. My room gets cluttered but never nasty. My mom seems to be perfectly fine in a world of filth. I recently just cleaned the fridge. It was bad there were cups of old grease that resembled tiramisu layers (and a lot more shit) so I cleaned the entire thing while my mom was complaining about it. Eventually I finished and she didn't realize how clean it could be. she loved it and showed family and friends before and after. I attempt to clean things from time to time yet many times shit goes back to how it was before and it's annoying that she can't help keep it clean. I just cleaned her bathroom countertop which had gunk from months if not years. There were like 4 mugs, trash,receipts, AirPods (that she never uses), and much more. More than half the crap was trash. I cleaned everything on there and scraped the gunk up and it was pristine and I put back essential items which I had to individually clean also and yea so I organized stuff on counter and even put some decor. She saw it a few hours later (and tbh I was expecting this reaction anyways) she starts complaining ab it no thank you she starts criticizing me for going in her bathroom. She claims she now can't find her waterpik stuff (even tho there's a box on the toilet tank) and I cleaned the entire counter there were zero waterpik things there. I also wouldn't have even thrown them out because I have common sense. She then found what she was looking for also she will wait for when I clean or ""mess"" with smth to bring up a very specific item that all of a sudden she cares about even tho I've never heard her mention it. I took time cleaning that nasty counter and she can't even thank me for it. if I had someone do that I'd be like omg do my whole house! I get she worries that I throw things away but you can't get mad if I'm throwing away expired stuff or actual garbage should I bother cleaning anything for her?

1jahpt0,Advice for relationship with my brother,Nyx_90,"Hi Reddit community!

This is my first post, until now i was only reading on Reddit. I am in need of advice from community now. 

A bit of background information first. I am the oldest Sister of 3 Siblings. Have a 4 years younger brother and a 5 years younger sister. So back then as kids I was less close to both because of the age gap but the two were pretty close as they also shared rooms for a long time.
I moved out rather soonish from home for studying but both siblings stayed much longer at home. 
With my brother it was always a bit more complicated. Since i can remember he always had the feeling that he was treated unfairly compared to his two sisters. Cannot judge honestly, because as a child you just dont see those things clearly.

While growing up my brother kept being a complicated person who is easily triggered by things you cannot anticipate, taking many non personal things extremely personally (like talking about some random facts and if you say it is different from what he said, he snaps).This lead to that most family members avoid any confrontation with him, including me. 
Now we are all in our 30ies and the issue persists. He is living a quite isolated life and it is really hard getting close to him. I don't even know if he has any friends besides the online friends. We got into fights multiple times because of how he communicates (or not communicates) with me and other family members. He is often rude and blames everybody else for things he doesnt like. Example: my mum and him booked holidays, he agreed on all, destination, hotel, etc. But the moment they are there, he complains about everything and blames my mum (and me who isnt even there) because we were there many years ago and said the food is good. But he doesn't like it, so he shouldn't have agreed on this whole trip. Because also there is nothing to do what he likes. But he also didnt spend a minute on research where he wants to spend his holidays.

I am often worried that he is so isolated that he gets weirder and weirder every year. Maybe he is depressed and I dont know how to help him or even start the topic without him rushing out of the room angry. 
I hope someone has some advice how i could handle the situation. I love my brother but he is really having issues and i feel he needs some support.

1jaf4dt,Sibling issues,Specialist-Lynx-1425,"Hi,

I need guidance on what to do. I do not like my sister’s personality at all or really anything about her. I forced myself to visit her and talk over the past 10 years because I felt that what I was suppose to do. I am now in my 30’s and it’s getting harder to just fake it. I am not the only one in the family who feels this way. She was always the problem child and now adult. It’s just the two of us so I know she feels that we need to stick together but I just get the ick when I’m around her and do not ever have a good time. I just really want to cut her out of my life completely. She is embarrassing. I am completely embarrassed of her. I feel terrible feeling like this but for her to change my mind she would have to change her entire personality and mentality which in our 30’s I don’t see that happening. She keeps asking why I don’t come around and I just don’t have the heart to tell her. She is so negative, mean, ugly, disrespectful, rude, loud and we are not a good match. I feel like she is a weight on my leg and always has been. She always used me as her punching bag, backup plan, used me for money, just used me for really anything she could. I had a good heart and would help when I could. I started to realize both her and her kids started more expecting things out of me the older they got instead of being appreciative of what I offered as if they expected it. I feel like this mentality and influence came from my sister so I backed off a little bit. I really try to get along but I just can’t stand her. 
Any advice would be appreciated because I don’t want the kids to suffer but I don’t know what else to do. She’s not funny at all either and makes backhanded comments in front of people for fun. She says she joking but I think she secretly loves tearing me down in front of people. I just want our relationship to be purely transactional for the kids sake but I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

I don’t think a situation like this is acceptable to just let it slide and act as if nothing happened just to have their family united again? Or how would you have handled the situation? I have not received an apology from any of them especially her but they tell my husband that I need to let it go.  ,4,2,1741848189.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ja5y6x/brother_in_law_m45_and_his_wife_f43_say_i_need_to/
1ja0h9k,Help me help them,Kind_Wolf4680,"
Need some advice guys. For the last few months my sister and her husband have not been spending time together.  I've asked are they having problems but she insisted they're not. They have been together almost 20 years with 2 kids. He is a huge part of my life and  I am closer to him than my own brothers. He confided in me recently they are in fact having problems and haven't spoke in 7 months over stupid petty stuff. It broke my heart to see him so vulnerable.  Both are so stubborn . I told him he needs to speak with her and try sort it and he said he would try . Now I'm afraid she won't listen and continue to be stubborn. He told me not to say he spoke with me about it, I'm afraid if she found out she'd be angry and upset  But how do I get her to confide in me and how do I help ? It breaks my heart as they were always such a sweet and funny couple and I don't want them getting a divorce . I suffer greatly with anxiety and this is weighing me down so much I can't eat or sleep . Any advice appreciated ",1,0,1741828881.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1ja0h9k/help_me_help_them/
1j9z6ie,Family secret,AverageMiserable3929,I’m sort of in a bind here. I was informed of a family secret regarding my husband by accident. It’s about who his real father is. He either is lying to me or he really doesn’t know. From the stories he has told me he has only met his father twice in his life time but that’s not who his father is… or that’s what the rumor was told to me. Apparently by this family member my husband knows. But I’m not too sure. Should I even ask him about it? I don’t even know how to bring this up without destroying the family dynamic if he doesn’t know. ,1,0,1741825159.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9z6ie/family_secret/
1j9yqu2,Forced to Play a Sport I Hate—How Do I Get My Dad to Listen?,littlehoeofFelix08,"I (16F) have been playing field hockey since I was 4 years old. For the first eight years, I absolutely loved it and would count down the days until my next game. But when I turned 13, my first hockey club merged with two others to form a much bigger club. At first, I didn’t mind, but because of the large number of players and new people wanting to join my team, I was placed in a much weaker team. That’s when my passion started fading.

On top of that, I faced a lot of discrimination as a POC, which made things even worse. I started losing interest completely and wanted to quit to focus on tennis instead. However, my dad refused to let me stop. When I turned 14, he forced me to join a different club, which was a 30-minute drive from home. I knew no one there and hated the idea of starting over. Still, I pushed through for a year, but this season, I truly can’t take it anymore. I dread every training session and match so much that I cry every time I have to go.

I’ve tried talking to my dad multiple times, explaining that I absolutely hate playing now and that my teammates dislike me because they’ve played against my old club and don’t know me personally. But he just won’t listen. Out of desperation, I’ve started faking sickness and lying about training being canceled just to avoid going.

I feel trapped. How do I get my dad to finally understand that I don’t want to play anymore?

1j9x12n,I need help,Dazzling-Isopod6746,"okay, so i’m not sure how to start this but i think my mom killed my dad. yeah, i know, sounds insane and i have no proof of this but i just have a feeling, which i know is not enough to accuse my own mother for something horrible. my first cousin, i think maybe last year, said “oh, what if your mom killed your dad?” (for context, we were watching a documentary with my second cousin and my sister, it was called ”american murder: the family next door ) I didn’t say anything back, neither did my sister. i didn’t really know what to say, i guess it was just so specific. i think in that moment it really got me thinking: “what if my mom did kill my dad?” present time, sunday, i went on safari  and searched my mom’s name and my dad’s and a lot came up. i was on a website called [truthfinder.com](http://truthfinder.com) and found my mom’s full first name and did a lot to go a report, they call it, and i was interested in seeing criminal records or anything i could find. i found a lot like duis, and dwis records, photos and videos, inmate records and the one that scares me the most in the process of getting the report was registered sex offenders. not sure what that means but i can only hope that it just offenders that live in the area and it has nothing to do with my family. i also looked at the relatives and found my mom’s sister’s name on there.   i also found a court case i think my mom was in or is currently in. i searched up my mom’s name and “court” after it and the first link was someone i didn’t know v. my mom and i was scrolling looking the the updates and what had happened - this is what i found out: on october 24th 2018 consoildated edison company of new york, inc filed a property repossession lawsuit against my mother and someone by the name of john roe, and jane. it was filed in queens county courts, queens county civil court located in queens, new york. the status of the case was disposed. that was a summary of what happened the judge was someone named timothy j dufficy and the plaintiff being someone named hansrajie payne and the defendant being my mother and father or rather it’s says on unicourt “my mother’s full name individually and executrix of estate of my father’s full name. the plaintiff attorney was someone named friedman daniel and i’m not sure who was my mother’s and father’s attorney or if they even had one. the thing that gets me is that, this takes place in 2018 but my father passed 2017 on the 24th of june. i fins really weird cause why is my father in a court case when he isn’t even alive? i don’t know. i think he was born november 4th 1964, and i say ”i think” because he died when my sister and i were really young i was born in february 2008 and my sister the year after in may. i know this because i had also searched up my dad’s name and found an obituary online for him and that’s all i could find on him. which the day he died would make sense cause i remember being at the at the school year and in was during the summer the two websites i found it on was [tributearchive.com](http://tributearchive.com) and [kearnsfamily.com](http://kearnsfamily.com) . now it’s likely that these are different people but i can’t help but to feel that it is my father and i feel the the date and what i remember match. that’s what i found about them on the internet. also, on truthfinder i couldn’t get the report because i would have pay for it and i didn’t want to do that.

now time to get into my childhood and how i lived these past years. my father was definitely not a good person. he would picks fights, yell and would hit my sister and i. i don’t want to get into that too much because every time i think about it, i cry. i feel like my mom knew but didn’t say anything or didn’t care or both. it really fucked up my sister and i’s lives. when my father passed, which, for starters, i don’t even know what he passed from. i always thought it was from cancer like liver cancer or lung cancer, i mostly thought it was liver cancer but anyways, when he passed, my mother, i think she had some sort of mental breakdown. she would hit me i don’t remember if she hit my sister except for one time she told me. she would yell, and just be very distant. still is now, her relationship with us is very strained after he passed. well, let’s be honest it wouldn’t have been good other wise. she would buys things for us, anything we wanted and she thinks that’s building some type of relationship and making up for what she has done and what my father has done. my father didn’t want to buy anything for us for some reason and i think my mother is making that up by buying things for us and well.. killing him… we don’t spend time with each other we stay in ours staring at our screens. it’s sad but now when i think about spending time with each other feels weird to me. my mom said that he “changed” our father but i don’t think he changed, the same when he was a kid, and teenager, an adult, a husband, a father, a brother. if he changed why would he do this to us? i don’t wanna get into it, i already just cried a little. my mother is emotionally unavailable, i don’t confide in her or anything. our relationship is surface level.

now, onto to the part where i suspect that my mother killed my father. i feel like she knew he hit us and yelled at us a lot and didn’t really buy anything for us like expensive stuff for us. i don’t know why but i think she might’ve killed him because of that? like she feels guilty? but i don’t know because she has hit me and my sister too so it doesn’t make sense to why she would feel guilty. a few moths after my dad passed, my mom cut contact with my dad’s side of the family. we don’t speak to them anymore.

i don’t if this is all true or not, i let curiosity get the best of me and i found a lot of the internet and i don’t know if i’ll ever get the answer i’m looking for and figure out the truth. i feel as if there’s a lot more to discover about this family. i wish i didn’t look up their names but as the same time i’m glad i did otherwise i would’ve never known but this feelings will always haunt me even if i get the answer i’m looking for. i don’t want to share my father and mother names because i afraid that someone i know, a family member and someone that someone that knows my father might see this.. however none of which i know use reddit or i don’t they use it.. eh, it’s risky. i don’t think i’m gonna do it even though it’ll help a lot. i’m sorry about that. i don’t have the answer to most things because my brain has hidden memories and most of the time i can’t remember what happen before or after the event. i think this is caused by the traumas in my life. let me know if you find anything or what you think about this i would be so grateful to read what you think or what you found! thanks, have a nice day/night.   - j   written: 3/9/25",1,1,1741819332.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9x12n/i_need_help/
1j9w3rw,I told my sister I won’t be talking to my family regularly,eu4ia-,"My sister (29F) and me (17F) were close when i was younger (she was my idol). That has since I changed. My sister is moody and we have a big gap between us (age), so she always wants to little girl me. I’ve never been close to my family, it’s not how i was raised. She was tossed around in my family, before living with my grandma. I stayed with my mom until she was later taken away from me and my father passed away. I moved in with my grandma now in a different state. I have a long term bf who I do actually see a future with. Anyways, my sister and I’s relationship has since been strained due to her still wanting to baby me at my age and being independent. She enjoys checking in on me, I don’t mind. I am not the person who does the same all of the time. Maybe every 2-3 months. I’m not gonna call and I sure as hell will not remain extremely close to my family. I never have been. BUT while we were texting, I told her and I quote: “i’m never gonna be the person that calls my family. that’s not me and you guys will have to understand that.” - she is now upset at this text. But this is my boundary. My family believes I owe them to call all of the time. That’s not me. And the only reason I brought up my boyfriend in this (18M) is because me and him are going on two years. yes, soon for long term. but that’s a discussion for later. anyways, i mainly only call my boyfriend and even then. I graduated early and work full time. So I’m not really calling or texting him either (he is still in high school). And she got heated cause she was like “newsflash your boyfriend isn’t the only person you need to call. i’m done giving my time to people who always are moody. but i’ll feel you this, {bf name} better have everything you need.” truthfully, i’m okay. i love my boyfriend. my father was my best friend and objectively the person i spent the most time with and called. now it has reflected on my boyfriend since my father died going on 5 years ago. No, it’s not me clinging onto my boyfriend cause he reminds me of my dad. me and my boyfriend are objectively close and i think we have a future. but anyways, i feel like all teenagers would act like this..? like i don’t think this is an absurd way to act for someone my age. and my aunts think that too.",2,0,1741816906.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9w3rw/i_told_my_sister_i_wont_be_talking_to_my_family/
1j9qyal,Elderly Father Care-taken by Alcoholic Brother,thiswayupp,"My father is in his early 70s. He owns a farm business and has been having health issues. He owns his home. My brother is in his early 30s, he lives with my father as he has never moved out. My brother is an alcoholic and drinks beer all day and has done so for several years. He may work like 2 hours of the day on the farm and that’s really it, the house is not being cleaned. Layers of dirt on carpets, toilets are disgusting, probably 100 beer cans next to my brother’s bed, microwave built up with old food, clutter, no sheets on beds, gross mattresses and pillows.

My dad has enabled this behavior as he does not charge my brother rent (so he can get away with paying my brother low wage), my brother has no bills. He uses my dad’s truck if need be, phone bill is paid, brother is on state health insurance.

My father’s health is becoming poor, with being unable to maintain proper hygiene and general maintenance of home and his business.

My dad has no will in place, no designated POA. I’m at my wits end here…the house is disgusting. I’ve worked for his business since 2010 (15 years)…it’s just the three of us with the exception of maybe 2 other part time people who he also lays low wage. He still only pays me $22 an hour and lays me off every winter and I am left to collect unemployment.

While I am working there I wait on all customers, display product, restock, maintain a clean work space, manage the social media pages, file the sales tax, properly file wholesale sales, figure out cost and pricing structures. I live with my husband who fortunately has a great job and has been understanding of me continuing to work for my father. I am afraid if I do not return to work, that my father will have a heart attack. In the past, when I took days off, he becomes dehydrated from trying to do all of the upkeep and ends up in the hospital with a UTI all the time because he’s not taking care of himself. Or when he’s waiting on customers in my absence, he’s hard of hearing so people think he’s ignoring them but really he just can’t hear well, and he often doesn’t charge people correctly creating lost profit.

This is sort of all over the place. What do I do here? What are my courses of action so that the business continues to function, my dad continues to have less health problems, and for his house to become properly managed and organized? All of this stress is taking its toll on me.",1,0,1741803873.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9qyal/elderly_father_caretaken_by_alcoholic_brother/

(It is related to the thing that started the argument) I want to be a lover of a certain thing but they wish that I never liked it. After that, I started to release my anger. And then I broke an old plastic water tub from my childhood. I did not mean to break those stuff but to be honest, I break things when I get mad. 

To resolve things, I want to try on fixing that and they said that you will never get your allowance in school for like 1 or 2 weeks. I was telling them that I would fix it so I will repay them back but they still don't care at all.

One thing more is, they said that I am not a short person even though I am. They also said  ""From head to foot, I have no small body part"" even if from head to toe, I have plenty of small body parts. (by the way I am 5'2 and I still want to be short). Somebody even called me a ""delusional person"" because of my actions even though I am not.

1j9juij,I'm more concerned with being a good brother than a nice one.,Diligent_Force_8215,"
So, I (19m) run into this issue between my mother (54f) and sister (21f).

I do not remotely tolerate my sister's bullshit.

And, my mother, does not like this.

I have learned a degree of constant irritation toward my sister that I need to rectify and try my hardest to, but damnit if it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

She, frankly, treats me horribly whenever I'm around her, and she is exceedingly easy to set off. I consider her a spoiled brat, because most recently she cussed me for a half hour straight after all I said was ""no thank you"" when she told me to let her give me directions...*after* asking me for a quiet car ride. After I said no thank you, she just said ""well, why?"" 

Because, by her own admission, someone not wanting to do something isn't a ""good enough"" reason for her. Which...kind of implies she just blatantly doesn't believe in consent, but I'm not here to speculate.

I consider both her and my mom narcissists.

Well, she curses me for a half hour constantly, and in that time I'm asking her how I can help, before on the ride home I am blatant with her and say ""I am gonna be rude to you now. Because I'm tired of trying to be kind to you.""

She then tells me ""how rude it was"" of me to refuse something she wanted, even if it was going to help her get what she wanted.

Recently, she called me (3 damn times) in the middle of work talking about how expensive the Minecraft app was. I promptly told her I'm busy, to only call if it's important and that I'm working, and hung up.

Well, she decided that after nearly 5 weeks (she called February 14th), that the first thing she'd tell my mom about was how ""rude"" to her I was on the phone...a month ago. And so, of course, I was told I was an ass hole by Ma and to apologize to her.

This is the same sister who berated my cooking and the state of my home after literally begging me to let her in because she was scared of mom when she was drunk. She slept in my bed and ate my food, and all she had to say to me was:

""You should really f*****' clean more.""

I'm tired of being told I'm an ass hole when I am a good brother, but don't tolerate her bullshit and am honest with her, because neither of my parents are with her.",1,1,1741785464.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9juij/im_more_concerned_with_being_a_good_brother_than/
1j9i9do,"I feel guilty for feeling disgusted by my mother, who has become a shadow of herself.",urlkitten,"I (F30) feel so guilty every time I feel disgusted by my mother again. My parents split up when I was 10, and my mom was always a beautiful, kind woman. But in the past five years, she has become a shadow of herself.

Over the past 20 years, she drank a lot, neglected her health, never quit smoking, and went in and out of rehab for medication and alcohol addiction. But she always relapsed. I don’t think she drinks much anymore—if at all—simply because she can’t afford it. But medication is still a big issue.

She lost her job, is under financial management, has no friends except her sister, and has no future prospects. She has osteoarthritis in her back and can barely walk or stand. She is 58 but looks like 78.

Our conversations are superficial, and she has become disconnected from reality. I’ve been grieving the mother I lost for years and try to protect myself by keeping some distance. I see her every 2-3 weeks and call her briefly every few days, mostly for her sake. Despite everything, I know she is fighting internal demons and never meant to hurt me.

But when we talk, I instantly know if she has taken her pain medication. She slurs, speaks slowly, and talks nonsense. In those moments, I feel disgusted, can’t find empathy, and react coldly—even though she is actually being kind. Right after hanging up, I feel guilty because I know that one day she’ll be gone, and I will regret how often I was short with her. Yet, it feels like a reflex I can’t control.

The rare moments when she is clear-headed, I cherish deeply. We can talk for hours, and I try to enjoy it as much as possible. But the rest of the time, it’s so hard.

Does anyone else relate to this? How do you deal with these feelings?



**TL;DR:** My mother has become a shadow of herself due to medication addiction and neglect. I try to be there for her, but I often feel disgusted when she’s under the influence and react coldly. Then I feel guilty because I know I’ll regret it when she’s gone.

1j9bm4u,I dont know what to do about my family and their response to my grandfather molesting me.,CALADRIUS727,"Warnings: mentions of sexual abuse, pedos, incest,


So, for background information. I told my father (whom im estranged to now) back in (i think) 2023-2024 about my grandfather molesting me when I realized it would be revealed as my dad was looking through his ex-fiance's messages (off topic story) and he ended up calling the immediately family, first my grandma then my grandfather then my aunt. All of which were, of course, confused and shooken. ""Why would she say something like that,"" is my grandma's exact words. And ofc there was denying and whatever. Ended up with me telling the story five times.
This is how it goes, although, warning, it happened a while back and my brain is foggy because I was trying my hardest to forget about it and believe my grandfather didn't mean bad by it. Also because me, my siblings and dad, all were living in an RV on my grandpa's property and srsly relied on him so I felt like I couldnt say anything.
But anyway, it was back when I was 14 (im currently 18 turning 19) when the first time it happened. We were alone, it was snowing heavily, down by the garage and my grandfather was talking about me needing more love (he's aware my father is abusive and mother out of the picture). And so he was behind me and hugged me from behind which isnt too odd until he had his face in my neck and putting his arms up my shirt (and jacket) and groped my chest. Ofc I was shocked and froze not knowing what to do. Mind you, I was never given a ""talk"" the most talk I ever got was to not talk to strangers. I was really good at pretending though and he'd asked me ""are you okay?"" I think? Mind you, Im also reveiwing when i told my online ex best friend like a month after it happened bc i was scared to even tell my online friends. But i replied with ""eh? No not really"" like in a quiet voice and sorta walked off.
I cant remember too well, but between the first time and the last time, he has always been a bit too open with sex talk or would sometimes grope me a little or maybe press himself a bit too much when we rode the quad. (I tried my hardest to not act differently. I think it was because i didnt want to get into trouble, i always remember feeling like i was gonna get caught lying or smth. However, at some point, grandpa hadnt done it in a while and i thought that i could forget and move on. But i stupidly thought that (didnt knock on wood obviously) on the same day, last day, we went driving.  And he was a good teacher, gentle and nice, but on this drive things got crazy. And no, i havent gotten past my self blame stage even if i try to deny it so here goes (im 15 at this point turning 16). That day i was practicing driving till we got to the town where grandpa took over and we went to get some ice so while we got some we messed around a bit and i put ice down his shirt, cause im stupid and was having fun. But then he said ""ho ho just wait im going to get you wet"" and ofc at first i didnt think about it in thattt way. Then i did. I remember how my body went cold and i was uncomfortable. But i went on and drove. Drove till grandpa wanted a smoke break and and we parked at this vet park we stopped at a couple times before. While at the rest stop i dont remember a lot but i remember his tickling me and at first it was playful but then he held me down with my back on the middle console as im sitting in the driver seat, his elbow keeping my torso down (he does a lot of maual labor hes stronger than me, im just a chubby girl) and he ended up slipping his hands under into my pants and touched me for a couple of seconds. I tried to kick and say no multiple times, screaming it. My instincts kicked in though ofc and he got off me and was laughing, and i was too. Trying to laugh at least even when i was tearing up. I pretended like nothing happened and drove back home. Ended up sobbing in the Rv then doing what i usually did. Pretending.
So, after i told my dad he was a child about it and used the fact i didnt ""trust"" him enough to tell him  but told his ex fiance to maybe keep him away bc he visited our new home in every argument we have (that we moved in a couple of months after grandpa molested me last). He, a couple times, also almost nearly said ""i lost my relationship with my father because-"" ofc you can assume what he would say next as he always loved to compare me to my maniulative psychotic mother. Always calling me a liar yet swears up and down he believes me about my grandpa. Which doesnt mean anything to me because they have a sour relationship based on codependency and drugs that always ends up with hate. My dad talked shit about everyone in the family teaching me and my sisters no one else loves us or can care for us. So we believed him because no one reached out.
Not the point, the point of this post is, with the information i give you, and am happy to answer questions, is how i should react to my families response to this all since i have moved out from my fathers place after a desperate call to my aunt for help after the millionth time my dad threatened to kick me out because..well thats also another story but lets just say its money he wants. A lot of it. But yes im living with my aunt now, a girl who spent middle and high school online. So social skills are 0.
Basically, my aunt chooses to not talk about it. I forgot what she exactly said but its like, she is choosing to side step it. Shes got enough drama and I'm very grateful to her. But so she has informed after the talks we have had, which is the first time i was able to have a normal 2 sided talk with someone without being screamed at. And she told me how my grandpa has been doing drugs for a long time, probably with my dad too. But my grandpa mainly did weed and she beleives that my grandpa wouldnt be capable of doing what he did to me without the drugs messing up his brain. Which i totally understand where she could think that because i seriously loved my grandpa, he was my rock, and ended up becoming a boulder rolling onto me. (Very ill relationship with driving now and my body) She also makes it a point that pedos would be noticed from a younger age than how old he is. That he wouldve started with her, his daughter, and by no means did i agree with this. But ofc i love my aunt and all that, we dont need to agree with everything but she does not wish to say whether she does or doesnt believe me. And instead insists that the matter is one to simply not speak of. I should also mention she was molested by a rando when she was younger and thats why i felt like she may relate. But i have discovered incest feels much different.
Anyway, my aunt still talks to my grandma and grandpa, grandma still lives with him and they all seem fine. Like nothing has ever happened. Heard his voice a couple times and it made me ill, i cover photos on the fridge with my grandpas face in it with magnets. I try to avoid him completely but the reason i was having a discussion with my aunt to begin with was because she was trying to advise me to talk to my grandma especially bc she didnt dk anything to hurt me. (Cant go on to tell my aunt my grandma used to make snide comments to me and my little sister about our chubbiness. Never did it to the middle sis, shes skinny) i cant stack on smth else thats hearsay although my sis would attest.
The issue is, i have decided to not speak to my grandma but after my aunt put me in a situation where i had to speak to her (showing my art while on videocall even though i said no theb showing me) she thinks that im fine with it now and has bombarded me twice since and i try to be polite but worried my grandpa is listening. Before this abd the convo i always went upstairs when i heard their voice and refused to speak and aunt did a good job saying i wasnt feeling well or doing smth. I appreciate her for understanding. But she also doesnt want me saying anything about my grandpa or setting boundaries if i were to talk to her. Which i think, first, is a red sign, second, my aunt lied to me too. After my aunt and her fought over the painting my aunt told me that my grandma offered 50$ but i overheard her talking to her friend and said her dad offered it. Which makes me feel like i cant trust her or my grandma about this situation. Next thing i know she will try tk get me to talk to my grandpa, which i brought up to ny aunt but she quickly said she wouldnt.
It makes my blood boil thinking about how grandfather got away scott free and no one else knows like its a hush hush situation.
I just dont know what to do, I hate keeping the peace abd my family is the kind to say ""family comes first"" but it literaly never does to them.
All i know is my cousin, tiny boy, has seen him multiple times even after everything was revealed, which is smth that angers me to the point of snapping, especially because i saw them on a quad (which ny grandpa was a bit touchy a couple times on) and is one of the photos on the fridge. Like shes risking her son. Also, uou should know my grandpa and dad have the same name, and once, when i was around 14 (before) my dad got a call about some sexual assult on a girl and he was with his ex fiance (then gf) and very confused which he mentioned later on when i admitted everything but also his ex fiance told me before he did. Also beterrn the time i admitted what happened and when i called my aunt to help, i didnt get much contact from my family, less than before, was alr little.
Thats it rlly, would appreciate feedback. Thanks and sorry for the long post. I got away from my dad though, hope yall take that as a sign that things can turn around for the better.",1,0,1741755596.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j9bm4u/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_my_family_and_their/
1j98gz5,Living with relatives…,Rare_Anywhere6780,"We are living with my brother and always grateful for them for helping us out during hard times. Everything is going well but I notice my nephew their only child is mean to my 2 year old, he doesn’t want her going to his room so we mostly stay in our room. One time she got out playing in the loft with her older siblings (I have 4 kids) anyway she ran towards my nephew’s room and my nephew ran after her and slam the door and it caught my 2 years old little fingers. So far its the only time she got hurt coz of him but he likes to shut the door whenever he sees her going close to his room or like when he sees her in the loft even tho she’s with us. Okay I respect that he doesn’t want my toddler in his room( by the way he is only 7 years old). Today their door knob broke, its a scan doorknob and the first person was blamed was my toddler, before eventhe scan thing on the door knob got bad my nephew keeps going in and out of his parents room my child was in the room with me the whole and was out not even for 5 mins with her siblings in the loft and I doubt she has something to do with it! I can’t tell my husband because he will get mad and we are not in the situation to get mad because I know we’d be homeless. But I’m just so upset why my nephew is like that? Caught him a few times lying blaming my toddler or my other kids or would run away so he doesn’t get in trouble and he doesn’t know how to share but everytime I buy food/snacks he’s even sometimes the first one to grab. I just hope our financial situation would be okay real soon so we can move out before something worst happen.

1j92o4p,Feeling Overwhelmed After My Siblings Abandoned Me to Care for Our Disabled Mom—Am I in the Wrong?,toshkuh_23,"Hi everyone, I’m a 20-year-old female, and I’m dealing with a tough situation in my family. I hope some of you might be able to offer some perspective or advice.

To give you some background: I have a disabled mom, and last year, my siblings decided to kick her out of the house. Their reasoning was that they couldn’t deal with her toxicity anymore, and they felt burdened by her financial situation. We’re a Filipino family, and there’s this whole “utang na loob” dynamic where we’re taught to always be grateful for what our parents did for us. But growing up, I’ve seen my mom struggle to provide for us, and despite her efforts, she’s always been pretty hard to deal with.

My mom has multiple illnesses, and the worst of them is a broken lumbar 1, which really affects her mobility. I have two other sisters, but one is single and works hard to help provide for mom, while our older sister has her own family and doesn’t want to be involved. My brother also has his own family and doesn’t want to help either. One of my sisters has a mental disability, so the responsibility of taking care of our mom largely fell on my sister, Val, and me.

I’ve always seen Val working tirelessly to support our mom, even though mom never really appreciates it. She’s always negative and never acknowledges how hard Val works. Last year, Val finally had enough and kicked mom out. After that, I had to put my education on hold and get a job to take care of my mom because nobody else would help. Since then, my entire family blocked me, and I haven’t been able to contact any of them.

Now I’m stuck in this situation, trying to care for my mom and figure out if what my siblings did was justified. I get that they have their own families and lives to handle, but leaving me here to deal with everything on my own feels overwhelming. So, my question is: Is what they did right? Did they do the right thing by cutting me off and leaving me with the responsibility?

Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.

1j8yvh1,AITA,SarcasmMom84,Ok last year my sister and father tried put me in jail well first off my father has mental health issues and whenever our mother passed away me and my sister decided that since our father lived closer to me that I would take care of his finances not like a poa just to make sure he pays his bills etc and since my dad has mental issues he would always think others were always out to get him which is part of his illness and would always call me at odd hours of the day or just plain complaining about his neighbors which none of it were true and when I would reach out to my sister who lives 3 hours away would just say oh I can’t do anything to help like all the responsibilities were on my shoulders and I felt like I was replacing my mom who for some reason loved the man to death even with his disability. I just felt like he was more of an burden to me than a father. And now that I have 2 small children it was harder for me to go check on him or take him grocery shopping it was always a struggle so finally after do this for 10 years and having 2 kids it was to beginning to take a toll on my mental health and a stain on my marriage and my sister would never in the 10 years ever come to visit us or our dad but would always complain about the way I handled things I always told her to please help me or please come visit to help but she would never she also has children and a husband let’s not get into that with her husband lol anyways after she tried putting me in jail claiming I was stealing his SS money which I never did I had a job and my husband works full time we didn’t need help financially. But to my sister we were stealing and buying big flat tvs and vehicle which we weren’t. So am I the problem? Should I reconnect with my sister I have forgiven my father because I know he’s mentally unstable and can’t help it. So my question is reconciling with my sister the right thing to do or just continue keeping my distance. Oh and since this has happened last year the part where she tried putting me in jail she has taken my dad to live closer to her and she put him in a group home. Anyone have family issues? My other family members think I’m overreacting and should make the first step in reconnecting with my sister but every time I think of the lies she’s told the police about all the mean and nasty things I so called did to our father. ,1,0,1741720340.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j8yvh1/aita/
1j8xvk8,"I, F20, am fed up of being the ""ungrateful daughter"".",neovoko,"I, F20, am fed up of being the ungrateful daughter.

It's always ""You have to help your mother"" but never ""you should help your wife"" but somehow it always only refers to me, not my little brother (15). At his age I also had to help around the house. I know that times change but the fact that he doesn't even put his own plate in the dishwasher shows me that my brother is no different from my father (47). He can't even manage to put his plate in the dishwasher. My mother has given in or rather given up. She cleans up after my father as if she were his cleaner. And just because I don't do the same, I'm suddenly ""the unthinkable and lazy daughter"". But I'm exhausted. I'm tired of being the oldest daughter. I'm tired of having to clean up the kitchen every day to show my ""gratitude"" for my parents providing me with food and a roof over my head.  It's not that I'm not grateful, but I'm tired of being seen as ""the ungrateful daughter"" every time I don't keep the whole house clean since I'm not working right now. I'm tired of always having to clean up after everyone when they could do it themselves.

Just for reference, the first picture is how my family leaves the kitchen and the second picture is how I leave the kitchen..",29,18,1741717894.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j8xvk8
1j8ulnl,My father has been giving me the cold shoulder. Can someone give me a bit of advice on what I should do?,,"So recently my aunt passed. I was supposed to meet with my father the day she passed to talk about my wedding plans in Vegas. I'm not a big fan of planning weddings or marriages in Vegas but it was my dad's idea and he seemed excited so I was too. He was kind of pushing me to go through with it because he got married to a new woman in Vegas a year ago and they would be celebrating their 1 year anniversary at the same time. She seems nice but I don't know her that well yet. I didn't bother bringing up the wedding plans when we were supposed to meet because I knew this was a time of mourning for the rest of my family. He had actually told me the day before my aunt died that she was in the hospital. I was taking an exam at the time so when he texted me that she had been hospitalized I just responded with ""okay."" In the past I have gone to the hospital to visit her when she would get sick but I always felt like her kids hated me and didn't want me around, especially my aunt. She was never nice to me and she was always very cruel to me and my mother. Her kids always ignored me and shunned me so I never ever felt like I was wanted in their family. So when my dad told me she was very ill again (she lived with Lupus) I didn't know what to do or say. After that I think my dad took it the wrong way and completely ignored me. He's divorced from my mother but he ended up calling and telling her that she passed so I had to hear it from my mom. I texted my dad and called him but he never responded. I think that he was doing this to justify the fact that he was upset because I didn't go visit my aunt at the hospital or my cousins but he didnt even bother to tell me what hospital she was in when he texted me initially. I guess he expected me to ask. I also felt like it was my aunt's children that needed to make peace with her because they were estranged from her for while and I would just be some unwanted nuisance. I have never talked bad about my aunt and cousins but my father has. I dont think he really even like his own sister either. Maybe he did love her but I could never tell because of the way he spoke badly about her and her husband. I did pay my respects at the funeral but I've always had issues with all my relatives. They talk about me, spread rumors and some of these relatives shunned me as a child and never got to know me. All because I was raised by my grandmother and they hated her.

This isn't the first time that my dad has given me the cold shoulder either. When I was young he would go weeks, months, and the longest, a year without speaking to me. He would blame me for not wanting to be around him but he cheated on my mom openly and would verbally abuse her and I. I respected him, feared him, looked up to him, but I was never close to him and I'm his only child. Now that I'm older and I have my son and partner I realize how much it's affected me. I'm anxious, reclusive and I tend to push people away. I do feel like it's my fault for not showing up and seeing my family but I get such intense anxiety around them that it literally makes me sick.I have no siblings and a mom that really depends on me. She's never been on her own and she's lived with my partner and I for the past 10 years maybe more on and off. She has a lot of built up trauma and she needs a lot of help doing anything. Not because shes sick or weak but because she doesn't want to do anything for herself. Not having parents that are supportive and having no family to go to has really messed with my mind lately. I don't know what to do. It's opened up an inner wound that I've had as a child. I know that if I try to reach out to my dad again I'm only going to get a cold response. He basically ignored me at the funeral so I reciprocated the same. My father also had the audacity to talk to my husband when I walked away at the funeral and asked him if we were ready and excited to go to Vegas and get married. My partner doesn't like the idea because his family is not even going to be able to be a part of it. They can't afford to go to vegas and to be honest, neither can we. We were actually discussing what we were going to tell my dad before all of this happened but when my husband told him that we weren't interested in going to Vegas at the funeral he just got up and walked away. He hadn't even spoken to me the entire time, he just gave me a hug and said hello. Right after the funeral him and his wife went on a mini vacation. And I mean immediately after the funeral. There's so many conflicting feelings inside me because I love my father but I'm very tired of feeling so guilty and taking the blame for every little incident. I already felt disconnected from the rest of my family because like I said, they can be cruel for no reason. I've always been a shy and timid person and my father hates that but I can't help it. I'm a grown woman with almost no confidence sometimes and something is constantly tormenting me inside. Should I talk to him? Is this my fault? What should I do?

1j8tmvl,I haven’t spoken with my “father” for 5 years & now he’s offering to “give” me a vehicle….,Confident_Spirit131,"My “father,” Mike, & I have never had a good relationship. It’s very toxic and unhealthy so I ended communication for my own mental health. 
(I.E he calls me & my mother nasty names & always brings up past drama to dwell over. They have been divorced since I was 14, I’m almost 30 now.)
Recently I’ve started a new job, the first week in I was in a very scary car accident & totaled my SUV. 🚙 
My brother, who still stays in contact with him passed on the news, which led to my mom & brother calling me back to back to let me know Mike was going to “give” me 
A vehicle while also asking if they could give him my current phone # so he could reach out, so we could talk first. Being still very wary of this offer I decided to make a text now # for him to have…. It’s been two days & this man thinks I’m faking having a new number & has not reached out. Bc get this, he’s been harassing whoever has my old phone #. 🙃
We’re supposed to meet up this Sunday for the exchange. (He lives in SB Indiana, I live in Detroit MI) he expects me to get there of course… 
Now, I’ve tried to let my resentment for him go. I even wrote a long Father’s Day letter forgiving him for never being there when I needed him. He never got the letter bc again we don’t have each other’s contact information but it did make ME feel better… 

So now all this is dredging up emotions I wanted to forget. I feel like a little girl again just screaming to be heard & loved while it falls to deaf ears…. I can’t even feel excited bc I know he dangles things in front of me to get me to talk to him just for him to take back whatever it was he was promising to begin with. 😢🤦🏻‍♀️",5,1,1741707462.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j8tmvl
1j8t9sr,AITA: sisters secret,NoPerformance8374,"AITA: I have a complicated family but allow me to try to explain. My mother went through hard struggles. which then led me and my sisters to go through similar struggles. 

I am the oldest and remember bits and pieces of physical and emotional we were “dispiclined” . Mostly just being left alone a lot. It’s just me my sister and my mom as a family (dad jumped ship long ago 2 older sisters are no contact) . 

My mom was absent in my sisters life so I kind of raised her. My mom is now 30 years sober.  She was a live in nurse for a long time. Due to her age she can no longer work and she moved in with my family.  It was ok the normal family living together annoyances. But something happened that all of a sudden everything about her bothers me. Irritates me, I know it’s me. I lash out scream and kick her out and I feel like I am being possessed when it happens. Then I feel better she comes back and it builds until the pattern repeats itself. 

My sister saw the abuse she was abandoned by my mother many times. When I seek her help with understanding or looking into the past she looks at me like I’m
Crazy. My mom has changed she is a different person but why do I feel this way around her. 

I eventually came to terms with maybe I just have t healed or I have done to much. I need space just about every excuse and I would go over and over in my head trying to convince myself that I am the problem and it’s me. My sister and mom agreed. 

During therapy I kept asking what changed we were living together fine and then something changed. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I remembered about 2 years ago my sister was high and she told me that she thought maybe my mom had hurt her as a child. She would not go in any deeper she said she would talk to a therapist. That was it she never brought it up again my brain wiped it. 

When I remembered I asked her to help me move my mom out. I was overwhelmed and the secret was making it impossible for me to be around my mom. Did she? didn’t she? My sister said she would and then stopped coming around. Wouldn’t help with family anymore. Looking back I see what’s going on here. 

The issue became that my sister and my mom both kept pointing back at me after every outburst. They convinced me I had an anger issue. I was about to go to a facility or something. They told me it was my job, I left my job. 
The feeling persisted. I reached out to my sister again. Her response was sorry I can’t deal with this right now. 

I responded I couldn’t deal with you telling me “maybe” mom hurt you. I couldn’t deal with her living with me after you told me that. I can’t deal with any of this and you are both making me go through alone. 

I am not proud of how it came out I am not proud of the fact I did it in front of my mom. I know I did not do this the right way. I am still more leaned toward I’m just a raging bitch then to accept all of this. Its pretty clear that I have a self destructive tendency to want
To “be” the problem when the actual problem is my family is more than happy to make the problem my problem alone. 

I have been my families emotional regulator for too long. I needed to let go am I an asshole for doing it so abruptly?

I didn't follow the doctors directions and I am currently facing the consequences. Recently for the past week I can't seem to eat food without throwing up. I finally went to my mom and asked her to help me. She gave me directions and I told her about the research I had done. She told me that in my state, that those articles would not help and that I should do what she tells me. She says that home remedies are better but she also says that since the medication didn't work we should try something different. I said ok and asked if I could get some bread to eat with my eggs. She said that bread is not good for me. I walked away and did some research. (Not google). I read genuine health articles. I went back to my mom bit she refused to budge. 

We argued back and forth because I said I will believe you if you show me evidence that bread is not good . That was all I asked. Just show me proof. I did not ask in a rude way. I am desperate at this point and really want help. My siblings went onto my room and pulled out an energy drink. I looked at my mom and told her that I am mentally ready to quit all things bad. I said that this would be my last energy drink and with this I would also not eat anything that triggers my h pylori. She said not to drink it. There was only a little bit left. I tried explaining to her that is she let's me fin8sh this tiny bit that I would be mentally prepared to quit. That knowing this was my last drink would help me. But she refused. So I looked at her and drank it. I then asked her to help me cause I was ready now.

She said that since I refused her advice that I could not ask her for help. I calmly said OK and walked away. She told me to eat something cause that drink would cause me pain later today. I said to her that since she didn't want to help me she can't tell me what to do.

1j8nweu,My brother’s ex-wife is purposely ruining his mental health to “win him back”. Part 3 divorce and manipulation.,mysticalhair113,"Please read part 1 and 2 for context. Apologies for the length of the post but it’s 14 years cramped into 3 posts. 

What could my brother do at this point? Knowing his former bunk mate and his wife were cheating in front of him. Take a drive to Separationville. At this point my brother started sleeping in Rio's room. My brother wasn't saying much but I was keeping up with Lilly on social media. Months had gone by and things were very strained, so much so that Bernie had gone to stay with Cassie and Laura. Cassie and Laura were going through the beginning of the end of their marriage as well. Cassie realized that Lilly was playing with her feelings and her pocket. Laura was falling in love with Lilly, Lilly was promising a relationship with her. Laura was essentially paying for anything Lilly wanted. 

Now we are entering 2023, around February Lilly decided to go away with a friend to Seattle. Who's in Seattle? Mike and his wife. Lilly had kept sending Mike spicy messages throughout the year and wanted to see him to make things happen. What she wasn't counting on was Mike sharing the spicy messages with his wife. Needless to say Mike's wife shut that down, if you saw Lilly's posts and pics from that weekend she looked so sad and I almost felt bad for her but I would speak to my brother and know that this is the universe’s repayment. In June, Bernie officially moved out of Cassie and Laura’s house and embarks on his own journey, moves into his own place and finds his first post-military job. During the time of the separation, my brother was being an exemplary father to his children while being a supportive and encouraging person to the mother of his children while trying to figure out himself.  October comes by, Lilly and Laura take a trip to Atlanta. This trip was meant for Lilly to hook up with a childhood friend that she was fantasizing about which never happened. 

Early November, Bernie lost his job due to him being careless. He came home for a week to advise us that they were getting a divorce and needed to be around people who loved him. He goes back to California and one afternoon in which he’s babysitting, she’s accusing him of sleeping around, so much so that he spiraled downwards and ultimately ended up at the mental hospital. Guess who decided to go to the courthouse to file for divorce while Bernie was having a 5150? You guessed it, Lilly. Lilly wanted to make sure it was her that did it. She had been manifesting it for years, during our car rides she would say “when me and your brother get divorced, we’re going to be the best of friends.” She has been scripting the story, y’all. Bernie went back to his apartment and started making the moves necessary to leave for himself, he needed to get rid of her. Unfortunately it also means leaving the kids. Three souls that have done absolutely nothing wrong and have to lose out on the one parent that cares, the one parent that wants to parent. 

March 2024, Bernie headed East and went home with his dog in tow. We received him with all of the support, love and care that can be given and received. During one of our many conversations he shares that Mario and Stacy are divorced, Laura and Cassie are divorced. My parents have given him the space to be who he wants to be and become. Since then the divorce has been finalized, Bernie has been out to California countless times for weeks to take care of the kids while his ex wife has ""vacations or work trips"". It's hindering him from getting an actual job. Just as he started school in August she needed him to take off for a couple of days so she can vacation. In October he had to take a leave of absence so he could help her move and drive across the country to the East Coast. In the 4 months they’ve been living there my brother has been there at least three times a month. She wants him back. Her actions are of someone that wants her husband back. She constantly calls him with a new emergency in which he drops everything including school and drives down. 

This last weekend we asked him to stay home so that he can spend time with some family that wanted to see him because my brother is a really cool guy when he’s mentally in it. She had put him so much through the emotional wringer that he couldn’t be present for anyone and locked himself in his bedroom. Last night his location was at school (NJ) at 5pm and then check his locations at 6am today and he’s in (NC) At this point she is giving, unfit parent that can’t deal with tween twin attitudes and a young boy that is now on 2 tablets over stimming his mind. She is not mentally stable to deal with three autistic children and is making him mentally unstable. I’m afraid of what my brother might do because of her manipulative behavior. 

What can I say? This is my biggest heartbreak. This is one of the most painful stories that I’ve ever witnessed. A woman that has torn 3 families apart, incapacitated 3 kids all because she can’t get over herself. I’ve told my brother to document everything and take her to family court and set clear boundaries. He caves in to her wishes and commands because she’ll cut communication with the kids. She’s done it to me before plenty of times, that’s why I don’t talk to her. My feelings for her have layers, they range from anger to love and back to rage. What would you do with someone like this in your life? What kind of advice do you give my brother about regaining custody and improving these kids' lives?

1j8ns6m,My brother’s ex-wife is ruining his mental health to “win him back”. Part 2 Moving with Deception,mysticalhair113,"Please read part 1 for context. Apologies for the length. It’s 14 years broken up into 2-3 posts.

Shortly after this we find out that all three kids have Autism, with time it was determined that they are also non-verbal. California is deemed as one of the best states to live in to receive services for children with autism. Early on in their diagnosis they were getting the proper behavioral/occupational therapy needed to grow. Rio since the age of 2 wakes up with a tablet in his hands and doesn't let it go until he falls asleep. The girls are partial to a tablet but are into imaginative play, puzzles. The occupational therapists would go to the house and teach the kids in their environment, one day one of these therapists saw Lilly hit one of the girls and called CPS as she's required to. This infuriated Lilly and changed companies. As this is going on with the kids, Lilly started working for herself selling leggings, Avon, anything that she can do from home, made some friends, getting acclimated to her surroundings. 

My brother is encountered with his first big deployment and he's gone for 8-9 months. At this time I was going through a major mental health crisis and decided to leave home and go to California to both look for work, start a new life and help with the kids. Lilly gave me 8 weeks to get my act together. They were living in a four bedroom, three bathroom house on base, just guess where I was placed, IN THE GARAGE. I would travel to the big city on Monday and walk to different salons, retail stores looking for work. I would stay in hostels and eat one meal a day to make my money stretch. The only thing I would allow myself to enjoy is some pot both to help me relax and take my mind off of things. This was something that she hated, and would constantly start fights with me regarding my pot use, which back then would be a hit or two and then go about my business. I was broke and had to make it last. Around week 3 of my stay, she was getting very antsy constantly complaining about her neighbors and told my brother that she had to move out of the military housing. Week 4 of my stay she advises me that she found a place and that we would be moving within the next 2 weeks. This new place was a two bedroom, single bathroom house, where she said without using words, ""get out"".  I help her pack everything. Then came the weekend of the move, Lilly recruited another married couple (Stacy and Mario) that her and Bernie befriended to help with the move. I would do trips to the new house with the kids and be their babysitter while Lilly and the married couple would move everything else. Unbeknown to me, the wife would stay home and take care of their baby; that means that Lilly and Mario (husband of the friend,) were left alone to move. She put the moves on him and they smashed. This is the first of many marriages she will ultimately destroy. I left two weeks later because I was tired of her, my morale was low due to constant rejections from job interviews.    

After the move the kids were still receiving their services, my brother came home and everything was good from outside looking in. I was happy that my brother had found a military friend because he doesn't make friends easily. I was content in knowing that they were in a good spot. Six months living in this new space, they have to move. Why, you ask? Apparently she was receiving social services payments and was going to have them revoked because they were receiving extra income to pay for their housing outside of the military base. So now we move back into military housing. Remember Lilly having weight loss surgery, well she lost 120lbs. She's weighing in on a healthy 145 lbs and is feeling herself, saggy skin and all. At this time she decided to go on an app to make friends because she is feeling lonely. She meets and befriends Mike. Mike is 6'6"" 280-300 lbs, he's a MARRIED guy with a big heart. Mike not only befriends Lilly, he befriends my brother as well. As Covid is starting in the United States I take a trip out to California to see everyone, the world is yet to be shutdown. March 2020 happens and the world is shut down. We are all living in our bubbles. My brother is placed on leave because my nephew has asthma and the military had very strong precautions with people with lung illnesses. In May my brother goes back to work and he's faced with his second deployment set to leave in June. Lilly is set to have cosmetic surgery in July to take off the excess skin and get breast implants. So who is there to take care of the kids? I have gone back to work and my job had a strict travel policy in place, so it wasn't me. My parents are older and refused to travel, so it wasn't them. The care of the kids was placed on Stacy, Mario and Mike. Who was taking care of Lilly while she was recovering? A very married Mike. 

Bernie's deployment was cut short and was home for the holidays. Me and my parents decided to go to Bernie's for Christmas because they hadn't traveled in all of 2020 and genuinely missed him and the kids. In this trip we meet Laura and Cassie, they are a lesbian married couple that Lilly befriended, that lived around the corner. There was something about them I wasn't too crazy about. Weeks earlier Stacy and Mario had a falling out with Lilly and Bernie due to the fact that Stacy's dog attacked Lilly's cat while dog sitting, ultimately that cat had to be put down but the friendship was already strained due to Stacy confronting Lilly about how she parents her children. Let's touch on Lilly's parenting, she does just enough to not get CPS called on her. The girls will go days without brushing their hair, she feeds them simple quick things so she doesn't have to put much effort into cooking. She believes that these kids are normal and one day they’ll be normal. Yes they are normal to me and to our family, because we’ve embraced whatever form of communication they can give us. She praises her own parenting online as ""I go so hard for my kids."" looking and seeking for the reaffirmation of other people that don't personally know how she parents. CPS has called on her two more times because of how the children arrive to school and about something more personal that I don’t feel comfortable discussing. She also uses these kids to help her promote her online boutique, which bothers me immensely. 

In January of '21, Bernie and Lilly decided to open up their relationship to include Laura and Cassie. They did the deed. Bernie was ok with the terms, Lilly not so much. She loved the attention she was receiving from everyone. Cassie was falling in love with Lilly, Laura was developing a deep friendship with Lilly. Bernie was starting to get inklings that this wasn't healthy and that it was time for them to move and have a fresh start. In April they purchased their first home almost two hours away from the military base. Bernie was going through some transitions at work that was causing him to be away for 4-6 weeks. He asked me to be a great sister and help with the move. At the same time, I was leaving my job and felt it was the perfect time to spend 2-3 weeks in California. So I arrive and catch Cassie making out with Lilly in the old house. I approach Lilly and she said that they are spicy sleep partners and that it's ok. As the days go by Cassie is doing everything a woman that's pursuing someone would do. Lilly was having a bad day, she was DOORDASHING her favorite treats and flowers. Later I would point it out to Laura that this was going on. I was tired of seeing them, they lived two hours away and yet they were there everyday. On weekends they would sleepover and play blended family. Lilly thought she was having her cake and eating it as well. I called my brother and unleashed everything that was going on, he ignored what I was saying. A couple of days later, I approached Lilly about this and told her about herself. The following day she had a mental breakdown that caused my brother to come home early even though he wasn't supposed to. Six months later Cassie and Laura follow Lilly and Bernie and move 8 minutes away. Unlike Cassie and Laura the one thing that didn't follow the family was the additional therapy the children were receiving. Lilly was only depending on the education the kids were receiving at school. Lilly swears that she reinforces what the children learn at school at home but she doesn’t, she hands them tablets so they don’t bother her. I promise, we're getting close to the end but this is where it gets good. 

Bernie decided that he had enough of the military full time and it was time to leave it, he put in his paperwork and by June of 2022 he was out. Lilly had decided to throw him a party for his retirement. She invited "" the girls"", a couple of other couple friends they made and a couple of guys from my brother's unit. Apparently she had one guy in particular as a friend, Chad. If you're asking where Mike is, he went back to his home state to work things out with his wife. Before the party Chad had purchased a new car and picked it up the day of the party. Chad arrived at the party and was so excited to show off his new car. He asked my brother to take pics of him and the new car on his phone. Chad hands over his phone over to my brother to take pics, while he is taking pictures who is to send spicy pictures. You guessed it, Lilly. Chad expressed to my brother that he and Lilly were sending spicy messages and wanted to see what she was all about due to their open marriage situation. Bernie asked Lilly if this was what she wanted and she said yes. With that said Lilly was having a spicy mambo while my brother took Chad's new car on a ride and rode through all the red lights and tolls possible. Needless to say this was the beginning of the end.

1j8nosj,My brother’s ex wife is purposely ruining his mental health to “win him back”. Part 1 the beginning.,mysticalhair113,"This story begins roughly 13-14 years ago, dates elude me because I have smoked a lot of pot and also trauma blocked moments in time. This story isn't about me, this story is about my brother, his kids and his narcissistic ex wife. I apologize in advance for the novel. For context, I am 40 years old, single with no kids so I really try to stay out of married people's messes and really try to avoid giving parenting advice. My brother is now 37, we come from an old school Caribbean Latin household in which mom is very much a narcissistic person in a good and bad way (smother mother). I do carry some of these tendencies but between therapy and doing shadow work I have been more of the soundboard of common sense in all of this. My brother, on the other hand, is a severe people pleaser.

My brother, Bernie, started dating his now ex-wife that we will call Lilly 14 years ago. Lilly was my brother's first everything at 22 years old. He was not her first everything. As they dated she made all of her red flags visible. Controlling, manipulative, jealous, self-centered, but great girl overall (insert eye roll).  A year into this relationship my brother decided to join the military because he tried the school thing, he was working a dead end job where he was constantly overlooked for promotions. Bernie is my favorite person in the whole wide world, I wasn't opposed to this move for him because I knew the doors of opportunity that this decision would have led to. He left to bootcamp and he would write letters to Lilly, me and our parents. During this time we hadn't heard from Lilly, I didn't care one bit. I frankly hated her then. She hated us then because she was and is very insecure, she was heavy set and felt that we would make fun of her. My brother is a very good looking guy but due to childhood teasing he feels he's an ugly duckling. I saw everything that was wrong with her at 18 years old. Time for Bernie to graduate from bootcamp and he informed us that Lilly wanted to go with us. It was a 14 hour drive going to the military base he was at and during that 14 hour drive she took any and every opportunity to tell us how sick she's feeling and how she has no insurance to pay for her medical bills. Graduation happened and then we drove back home with our new service member. At this point it was a 16 hour drive back home hearing the same complaints all over again. By hour 11, I pulled over and threatened to leave her on the side of the road if she didn't stop complaining. She toned it down for the rest of the ride.  

The military here pays more to their service members if they are married. They felt it was best to get married during the break he got in between bootcamp and his first station. They didn't inform anyone on our end because he knew how temperamental both me and my mother were at the time. She told her aunts and went to lunch after their courthouse ceremony. The day he got married he went out clubbing with me to celebrate our joint birthdays, Lilly didn't come because she was 18. The day they decided to get married was 4 days before my birth date. He then leaves to his actual first station. My actual birthday was the day after he left for his station, on this day Lilly shoots me a text ""Happy Birthday Sissy"". I responded, ""Thank you for the birthday wishes but please don't call me sissy. I am not your sister."" She came back with "" oh yes you are. Me and your brother got married on Friday, so you're my sissy-in-law.""  I saw red. I destroyed all of his Lego sets he had built and cried. 

For the next couple of months Lilly is attending college and my brother is in his first station learning the job he's going to be doing for the military. My brother visits for the holidays and informs us that his second station is going to be Alaska. At this point Lilly is going with him to this new station and officially start their lives as a married couple. Not even 6 months into this move, Lilly felt a need to move her coworker into their apartment to save costs because she wanted to live outside of the military base. Lily's grandmother passed away and I paid for the emergency flight home. During this time the coworker was trying to make moves on Bernie but he only had eyes for his wife. Being that Lilly was staying out here longer than expected, the coworker was only getting more aggressive with her approaches and forced Bernie to get his superiors involved and wrote him a letter to get out of his lease and into military housing. 

A year later they had a set of the most beautiful twin girls (Moon and Sky) that I had ever set my eyes on, of course they look just like me. I flew out to meet my girls. Lilly felt the need to gatekeep pictures, videos, anything that an aunt and grandparents would want of the babies because they were HER KIDS. Six months later they travel to us with the girls and I'm just ever so in love with them. Unbeknown to me they were having marital problems and something my mom said to her had made things worse. When they arrived back to Alaska, they were at the point of separation. They decided to have a date night to talk things through, one drink led to another which led to spicy sleep which ended up being the conception of my nephew. That following January my nephew was born, he was born with some physical impairments that needed immediate attention in order for him to walk properly. In the month after Rio was born, I flew out to meet him. The week after I was there my parents flew out to meet their grandson and to help with the girls. During this time my mom saw odd behavior from Lilly, whenever my brother's friends would come over she would wear skimpy shorts and flirt with them. My mom would call me whenever her and my dad would go on a walk so that she could tell me what was going on. One day she called me crying because Lilly took a cute picture of Bernie with the girls and Lilly refused to text it to her because she didn't want to. Lilly told my brother a different story and ultimately my brother asked my mom to apologize to Lilly because she upset her. Wild, right? But wait, there's more.
At this point my brother was in the military for 4.5 years and was going to renew his contract and with this came a move. You couldn't even imagine the level of excitement that I had that my four most favorite people were moving within the lower 48 states. During this time Lilly gets gastric bypass to help with weight loss and other health issues that she has. My brother and his wife felt it was the right time to get the children baptized a week before the twins' fourth birthday. We all flew out, her side/his side. That weekend was a beautiful weekend but it was going almost too well to be true. My mom is the type that if she spent money on something, she will let you know that she did it and how much was spent. My mom expressed to Lilly's grandmother how much she spent on the souvenirs and how she schlepped them cross country, which apparently got under Lilly's skin. That Tuesday we were supposed to go from the hotel to the house and spend the rest of the week with them. On Tuesday we arrive at the house and I'm in my own world, in the middle of the afternoon my mom says something to Lilly about maintaining the house clean or something about the kids and Lilly loses it. Lilly yelled at my brother, cursed and yelled at my parents eventually kicking them out. My brother left because he couldn't deal with it. I took my parents to the airport and took myself to a hotel. My parents trip was cut short by 4 days, and lost additional money on emergency flights back home. I was in town for an additional couple of days because I had business in the state later on in the week. Ultimately after that week the relationship between Lilly and my parents changed, to this day my mom refuses to bring anything up to her because of the harm she may do to the kids and my brother.

1j8lp30,My mum passed away in December 2024 and I was not allowed to see her and her funeral arrangements were kept from me. I was really close to her. This is a story of elder financial abuse.,ihafd,"In late 2021, my mum made the decision to move in with my brother and his wife. She sold her home, and together they planned to purchase a house, with my mum owning 50% and my brother and his wife owning the other 50%. 

However, the reality turned out to be quite different. What actually occurred was a clear case of elder financial abuse.

I discovered that my brother and his wife took all of her money, leaving her with no ownership in the new property and no financial security. I uncovered this information because I was the only one in the family who genuinely supported my mum after my father passed away. I provided her with financial assistance and looked after her daily needs. No matter where I was, no matter how busy I was dedicated to her needs. 

I stood up to them, but within weeks of voicing my concerns, I was banned from visiting. I continued to reach out, sending letters, birthday cards, and Mother’s Day flowers, and made attempts to visit. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to see my mum again before she passed away in December 2024.

When she passed away, I received the news through a text. I was deeply affected by it. None of my siblings reached out to me with the funeral details, so I had to find out through the church. It's puzzling why they seem to have turned against me, and I suspect there are lies involved.

Life can be cruel and ugly. 

I learned that my brother was claiming I’d been accessing our mum’s bank account and withdrawing funds. Fortunately, I obtained all her bank statements since 2021, and there it was in black and white: a staggering $500,000 in large cash withdrawals - all done by my brother or his wife. I hope the police will charge him with embezzlement, they are already investigating. This will be true justice for my mum and me.

1j8j92n,Family expectations and Career goal,Top-Specialist-7785,"I'm 24 years old and graduated from university about two years ago with a degree in software engineering. For the past year, I haven’t been able to work in my field because I was taking care of my father, who had cancer. I was his only son and the one responsible for supporting him. Now, it's just me and my mother—my two adult sisters are married and live nearby.

My mother wants me to find a job close to home, but there are no opportunities related to my profession in my area. I don't want to teach at bootcamps, and I dislike government jobs since they mostly involve paperwork. I want to work on serious, challenging projects. Right now, I do some freelance work, but the pay from local companies isn’t enough to cover living expenses.

I want to look for jobs abroad in my field, but my mother is strongly against it. She wants me to stay, find a stable job nearby, and get married. However, I don’t want to rush into marriage—I want to focus on my career for at least a year to build confidence before even considering it. I know moving abroad will come with its own challenges, but I feel like staying here limits my potential.

I’d really appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation. How can I balance my family’s expectations with my own career goals? Thanks in advance for your insights!

1j854kk,Idk what to make of certain behaviour from my dad,Consistent_Law6494,"This happened 3-4 years ago. My family (mom, dad, me and younger brother) went to a museum and by the time we left, it was time for lunch. We were discussing where we wanted to eat when I jokingly suggested that we go eat at a Korean restaurant. I didn't actually think my parents would agree but they did. So I was like yeah ok. And we looked up a bunch of Korean restaurants but all of them were too far from where we were at. Like at least 30-40 minutes to get there. So then I suggested we just eat at a nearby restaurant or a fast food place. But my parents were adamant about eating Korean food. 

And even on the way there I suggested multiple times that we stop at any of the restaurants in the way. But they didn't budge. Now at that time I was way into kpop because I was almost 14 at the time so I don't know if they were doing this so they could show me some kind reality about Korean culture or what because they were big on that stuff. They would constantly send me articles that said anything remotely negative about kpop or Korea. Anyway long story short, we ate there and left (food was delicious). And when we left my dad was fuming. He got really mad at me and kept telling my mom that he never wanted to come to this restaurant and that he kept saying we should go there. And then he stormed off to the car. 

  
To this day I have no idea what tf happened. Because I repeatedly told my parents to not go and eat Korean food that day, but later my dad turns around and gets angry at me? Because he didn't wanna eat there? And similar to this, recently we were at the mall and me, mom and my brother had to buy new flipflops for home. So dad took us to a crocs store. Everybody knows crocs are expensive. So he took us there and then got mad when we actually bought crocs from the store he took us too. He kept saying that my flipflops don't even cost that much. 

I'm really sorry if this post comes off as silly or stupid. I know this is not as serious as some of the other issues people post on this subreddit. But I really needed to get someone's opinion on this. ",1,4,1741630066.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j854kk/idk_what_to_make_of_certain_behaviour_from_my_dad/
1j84zbc,Always getting the short end of the stick...,Soft-Breakfast7694,"No more gifts? 

My husband comes from a large family as he's the oldest of 4 and we all have young children. Since we've all began having children, we started gift exchanging only for the kids on Christmas. 

Christmas 2023 - I only had one child at the time - my SIL made a point to say on Christmas eve ""I have to wrap the gifts still, we'll drop them off tomorrow"". I thought this was great because we left his Santa hat at the house that night, too. Gifts, nor hat, to ever be seen. I'm not one to ask ""hey where's our gifts?!"" but i wish I asked about the Santa hat... too late at this point. 

Christmas 2024 - I now have two children at this point - We created registries for the kids this past year (because amongst all of us, there's 8). We (my husband and two kids) spent Christmas Eve with my side of the family this year but we saw my MIL/FIL on Christmas Day. This is when I gave my gifts for my nieces and nephews to my in-laws to bring to the rest of the family as they were getting together that night. We didn't go because, traditionally, we do not travel on Christmas Day. That evening I was expecting a message at least to say ""hey thanks for the gifts"" from any of our in-laws, not that it was much, but at least for acknowledgement but we didn't hear from any of them. 

Now... like I mentioned earlier, we created registries this past year. I can tell who bought what. My SIL never gave my children their Christmas gifts yet I can tell exactly what she purchased.. 

This SIL is not immediate family. It's my husbands brother's wife. This same SIL never gave my oldest son a 1st birthday gift... 

For additional, unrelated context, my husband and I were in the bridal party for this couples wedding. A week prior to the wedding, we (my husband and I) had a heated argument with my FIL/MIL . Without notice, this SIL seated us at an entirely different table than the bridal party/family. We looked like total outcasts. Despite the argument, which had nothing to do with this couple, we would've been behaved/cordial/civil at the wedding as ADULTS should be. Instead, we had guests asking what we did wrong to be seated on the opposite side of the venue. Yes, that was her decision although it was very upsetting to me when I realized where we were seated vs everyone else.. 

Additional unrelated context: This SIL is the godmother to my other SIL's children and is constantly giving lavish and expensive gifts to my other nieces/nephews. I am not jealous, I want to make that VERY clear. However, I do feel like my children will eventually notice when they're old enough that they're not being treated the same or that they didn't even get a gift at all. 

I don't feel confrontation is necessary as I feel it'll go in one ear and out the other...and personally just want to cut them off entirely. In the future, if they were to give us gifts I'd probably reply by saying ""oh I thought we weren't exchanging anymore"". I'm not even sure why I'm posting this other than to get it out/off my chest. Am I wrong for feeling the way I do? Should I say something? Or just let it go, move on but just stop buying gifts entirely?

""How is that lady doing you were visiting?"" A practical thing he at times can ask about. And then it's about him again for 1 hour+ straight, the help he needs from me, and how tough everything is. Ok, it's no walk in the park with now a cathether (peeing bag, don't know the name). But it's always the case.

I have to force myself into the conversation, without him responding to what I actually say. My full adventure of being 6 months away from all his negativity because my plate was already wayyy too full, he chose to let me summarize it for 3/4/5 minutes, not acknowledge anything, then go off on a tangent about the manager I spoke about who took my job away, even with me calling him a senior because 'managers' were basically a trigger word. I took care of him by being the replacement psychologist, with him literally saying it didn't make a difference. This makes me feel nauseous, angry, and not taken serious at all.

I feel so hopelessly incompatible with him. He draws conclusions out of thin air without asking me anything, agreeing with the mediator I hired. ""It's obvious you haven't processed the passing of mom"". What the actual fuck. She barely knew me at all, for only an hour!

He says he wants to help me financially (self-inflicted college debt) and I believe that, even when i'm ignoring the point he makes me feel like a dumb kid because he writes out everything, like I can't think for myself and in my own advantage. That is because I have to tippy-toe around his feelings all the time, my aunt struggles with that too. He doesn't fully own mistakes he made and I hate that.

1j7t7u4,Betrayed by sister and brother in law,Objective-Stranger19,"For starters my sister and I were separated as kids and then grew into an un breakable bond. I have done everything I can to be a good little brother. I’ve paid expenses for her and her husband I baby sit when I’m in town and I try to take care of her dogs best I can. I’m recently getting out of the armed services potentially with some benefits. She told a close friend of mine “She is disappointed in you. You take every easy way out because you are lazy. You have no accountability for your own actions. You shouldn't be taking things from the military because others can't have it. There are real veterans that deserve more that you are getting. Shit like that” because I may be getting out with a retirement due to PTSD and depression. This feels like a lot of jealousy because her husband didn’t get anything and I feel stabbed in the back as she would never say this to me and myself and others disagree with her opinion. I’m not sure how to go about this. Any tips please?

TLDR: Sister said I don’t deserve the benefits I might get for being in the military. Feels back stabbed. ",1,1,1741591802.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j7t7u4/betrayed_by_sister_and_brother_in_law/
1j7sv5k,I yelled at my mother infront of my friend,Weary-Hour105,"I usually sleep late when I don't have school the next and it happens to be my father's birthday, the mood was already a bit off since a family friend's father, died as well and my friend came to pick me up if optional classes (we didn't go) and the first thing I wished my father happy birthday, I got yelled at for sleeping late and many more stuff from mother and father. Later that day my mother kept on making jokes about how I should give my friend snacks and all even though, I am clearly sharing, I brushed it off as her quirky humour. 

Obviously, I didn't love it, and she did it again, this time both my friend and I were hungry. I went to get some chips and as I ate some, I shared with my friend too but she made that same awful joke and I snapped at her, spat out the chips I barely shallowed, yelling how I don't like that joke and how I am sick and tried of her yelling and constant  ""jokes"".

1j7s932,IN LAWS,International-Air472,"I’m gonna try to explain the whole story to the best of my ability but my mind is all over the place because stuff just went down in my life.

So just for context I’ll explain the back story a little bit. So I have been dating this girl for 4.5 years and we love each other very much, we want to have a life together. So for the past 4 year her family were always so fake with me. They never liked me because i was always treating my girl so good and they always had problems with their boyfriend/husbands. So now that they see love, they are triggered by it because of jealousy.

So I am currently living with my girlfriend in an apartment. Shes been living here for 10 years and I moved in with her 4 years ago. Before I moved in she was living with her sister. And her sister’s name is on the lease, even to this day. When her sister left she didn’t say anything and kind of screwed my girlfriend over and make her fend for herself. And she left her name on the lease AND still got mail here. So time went by and our life kind of took a toll but long story short we were 6000 backed up in rent so we were gonna get kicked out. So we just decided to start a new life in a new city and start fresh because we were living in the same place for years and also her family lives in the same building too. So we kept it a secret since January from everybody just because we didn’t want issues and we just didn’t know what was gonna happen so we just tried to make moves. Finally when we secure a place and we are 3 weeks from moving out. We tell her mom and sister and they go BUCK crazy. Screaming at my girlfriend telling her that she’s selfish because her sisters name is still on the lease and maybe she wanted to live here because she’s losing her place too and we don’t communicate. Then all of sudden her whole family went into a big tantrums. Her mom started yelling saying she was selfish. Her other sister came to our apartment and started screaming at my girlfriend, (and like any good boyfriend I don’t care who you are you don’t disrespect my girlfriend.) I didn’t want to add fuel to the fire so I was trying to pull my girlfriend away because she seemed anxious and put on the spot. All of a sudden her OTHER sister is telling me to shut up and nobody’s talking to you. But I wasn’t even talking to her. I was just trying to calm my girl down and tell her to make everyone leave so we can cool down the situation. Her sister got up in my face and I was telling her to move back and then the sister that had the name on the lease started video taping me saying she was scared for her safety. If you were afraid for your safety, you can take two steps and the door is right there. She was literally in pathway to the door I wasn’t even blocking anything. She could have left. But they were instigating things and i got angry and i screamed and called her sisters out. He dad then called her said that im not a man and I should have been taking care of her and fixing things. Like I know the man is suppose to be the forefront of the household but im not god. I dont have all the answers. A relationship is an equal partnership, if i fall you got me, if you fall i got you. For context her family was always rude to me and I always took shit. My girlfriend never wanted problems so she would just leave it but i told her im a person and i deserve respect. I was always so open and welcoming to her family but I never got the same love back. They always talked down to me and treat me different, talk to me like a kid. I took so much for 4 years but i don’t deserve this. All I’m guilty of is loving my girl unconditionally. So now they all got involved and me and my girl feel horrible and annoyed and it’s kind of putting a halt in our moving process. It’s slowing us down. We now have her family on our coattails and I don’t know what to do. Was I or my girlfriend wrong in this situation. At the end of the day we are all adults, We were literally just trying to do something good for our life and move up but everybody is seeing it as us being selfish and we are not helping that sister. We don’t owe anybody an explanation, this is our life’s and we are full blown adults .

Thanks all for reading hopefully i shared everything proper. I’m typing fast because I don’t want to forget anything but if you have any questions let me know. Please be kind and don’t judge at the end of the day I’m human just trying to survive like everyone else in the world and I’m just trying to be happy because I’ve had a LOT of pain in my life.",1,1,1741587521.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j7s932/in_laws/
1j7m8ri,My stepmom and her family (especially her mom) act like they are my actual family or have any authority over ne,_aidischirris_,"My relationship with my stepmom is complicated, I have explained it in other posts. I don’t like her making decisions over me or prohibiting me things, I live with her but everyone knows that she does not like me. My dad knows this, and everytime he tries to do something she gets violent towards him. She is not my mom, she didn’t raise me, we barely talk. 
I get that she is close to her mom hut she tells her EVRY SINGLE DETAIL ABOUT ME, SO MUCH THAT HER MOTHER TALKS TO ME LIKE SHE ACTUALLY KNOWS ME, she tries to convince that my dad isa bad person, my dad might not be the best in many things but as a father right now he is better than before, he is actually trying with me afyer 15 years of not living together. I treat everyone with respect and all I get are yelling, passive aggressive comments, control. I don’t like thi, I just want to go away, run away… everything is so stressful. Like, why do I have to ask permission? Why does she hage to take decisions iger things like me driving (I am 17, my dad always talked about my permit wich I have not being able to get hecause she is not okay with it. Listen to this, she sent her mom to talk to me of how she is my mother and I should treat her like one), about going out, working, etc. I don’t want this, I didn’t even want to move here.",2,0,1741566965.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j7m8ri/my_stepmom_and_her_family_especially_her_mom_act/
1j7lvhr,"My sister is going off to college, and my parents don’t know how to talk to me. (14F)",RingPrestigious9389,"My older sister is very accomplished. Student council? She's on it. Theater stuff that I don't know about? She's organizing it. My parents are very proud of her, but now that she's going of to college, the attention is turning on me, and I'm just now realizing that my parents don't know how to talk to me. 
I personally like to fly under the radar, but now that I don't have a well-behaved older sister to hide behind, all my parent's attention is on me. Every time we are alone together, they either pretend like I'm not there or give your basic ""so how's school going, sport?"" talk, like I'm some random kid they just found. I find this frustrating, because I'm at an age where stuff is happening and I can't stop it. I don't take to change well, and my sister moving away is already a big shift, but my parents treating my differently is a bigger one. It's not like I'm not accomplished, I do a ton of jazz band stuff and I'm even in a rock band, so I don't know what they want. Do they want me to be like her? Are they gonna replace her or something?

1j7idd9,I don’t know if I’ll ever recover from growing up in an unhealthy family. I can't bear it anymore (19F),RushAmazing1419,"
I've never had a perfect relationship with my parents but they're not mean to the point I hate them, and I almost which they were so I could be mad without feeling bad, everytime we have our short happy moment I feel like the ""mental abuse"" never existed... I grew up with parents who often fought, never physically, but always verbally. There isn't a single day where they don't pick on each other, they don't even love each other, I hate that I grew up without seeing what it was to have parents that loved each other. 

Moreover, I'm pretty sure I grew up emotionally neglected, I heard : I love you, I am proud of you, etc.. once in a blue moon, and physically it was okay, but I kind of crave hugs. I am jealous when my friend tell me that she tells her mother all her problems cry in front of her and is hugged by her. 


I am having my finals soon, to go into an engineering school, in literally 5 weeks and I've been so stressed and anxious of failing, and they are being insufferable. They want me to help around in the house when this is like the most crucial period of my last two years. And lately every time they tell me something I am on the verge of tears, and I just can't take it anymore. They say I am like lazy, I am mean for not helping, and that once I will have my own house I won't be able to do anything, stuff like that...Usually I talk back or just act indifferent but I can't lately, I just want to get out, like the lump in my throat that have been here since almost a week.. 

I just wish I got a healthy family, and they don't see how much sacrifices I also did for them to keep the peace. In the house and try to de-escalate when they are fighting, and I had to take parts often even when I don't wanted to cause otherwise the parent who wanted me to defend them was mad at me. 

I had to be my mom's therapist, and I didn't even ask for all of this. She talks shit about my dad and he does the same, I feel bad for them cause I also want them to be happy. At the end I still feel bad and I still love them, I tear up in seconds thinking about loosing them but I can't even appreciate them because all there is in the house is negative vibes I'm always walking on eggshells; I know they love me, but that's not how I wanted to grow up. 

Now I just want to succeed in my exams, move far away, and try to live in peace, make real friends, start therapy and feel loved...But I will never get over not having a happy loving family.

1j7hgnf,Struggling with My Toxic Dad’s Family - Should I Cut Ties Completely and Avoid a Wedding?,senophilian,"I’m 21M, and I feel completely stuck in the middle of a toxic family situation. On my dad’s side of the family, they’re greedy, narcissistic, and manipulative. They’ll do anything for money and won’t hesitate to tear relationships apart over petty reasons. They make everyone’s life miserable if things aren’t going their way, and if they’re unhappy, they’d rather drag everyone else down with them. My dad is exactly like that.

On the other hand, my mom’s side of the family is supportive, kind, and understanding. They don’t hold grudges or cut ties over minor disagreements. They have always been there for me and my mom, no matter what happens.

The relationship between my mom and dad is rocky, and it has been for years. He even blocked my mom and me from contacting her older sister, my aunt, for 12 years. We weren’t allowed to see her or talk to her until her death. My mom regrets not keeping in touch, and so do I. 

Despite whatever happened between them, blood should have come first, and I now realize how important it was to maintain those connections.The worst part is, when I stood up to my dad and told my mom to divorce him because of the abuse, my dad cut me off for months. He’s done that several times in the past whenever I didn’t obey him or when I disagreed with him.

Things have gotten worse recently. My dad’s family has been plotting against my mom’s side, spreading lies and manipulating situations to create conflict. Every time they do this, my dad believes whatever they tell him, no matter how outlandish the stories are. Last Sunday, it led to a huge fight between my mom and dad. 

I absolutely hate my dad’s family, and I can’t stand the drama they bring into our lives.Now, there’s a wedding next month on my dad’s side, to one of my cousins. My mom and I have been talking about not going to the wedding. Honestly, I don’t even want to associate with them anymore, and I feel like it might be best to distance myself for good. I feel like I’ve been emotionally drained by all of this.

So, what do you think? Should I just cut ties completely and avoid the wedding? What else can I do to protect myself and my mom from this toxic situation? I’m tired of dealing with all this drama, and I just want peace in our lives.",1,0,1741553782.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1j7hgnf/struggling_with_my_toxic_dads_family_should_i_cut/
