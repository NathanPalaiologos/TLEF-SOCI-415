1kw60hm,Severely ignored by my family and being excluded,Tall-Jackfruit7375,"To start things off, I’ll explain my current living situation and the double life I kinda live

My dad works in a city 2 hours away from the one my mom and rest of siblings live in. I’ve decided to move with him and my younger sibling for a better fit uni for me. 
And i regularly visit my mother and siblings with my dad and brother every weekend.

My dad is a severe narcissist, I won’t get into depth as it’s too much but if I were to describe him with a few words they would be — cold, careless, unemotional, extremely selfish and only cares for himself, very manipulative.

The scary thing about this guy is he doesn’t show any of this at all, he is nice and doesn’t shout or physically abuse. 

I had to pick this out of him by situations that happened between him and my mother, and I am an extremely analytical person so over the years I’ve noticed his habits, body language, his words of choice, what he does with problems between me and my siblings or problems in general. I’ve diagnosed him as a narcissist. He fits all of narcissistic traits perfectly.

Recently. Him and my mother have had a strong fallout where he almost cut her off and he accused her of things. And also said things to her such as “go to fucking hell” and threatening with divorce, he also attempted to kick her out the house. 

This was all done verbally, and very coldly.

That pretty much tells you the type of person he is.

Moving on to my family, I’ve always had problems (severe) with my mother, she’s extremely religious (I am too, but not as extreme) and she’s caught me with stuff that completely changed her view of me. 

My privacy was crossed aggressively, I was hated so bad. But eventually those problems with her faded away and my relationship with her is improved. I think she still invades my privacy but in secret whenever I visit on the weekends by looking through my phone and such.

Both my sisters don’t like me that much even though they don’t say it, the first one I used to be very close with but used me and manipulated me and also treated me horribly, so I’ve cut her off but not directly.

The second one, I was never close to, but she talks to me and treats me as if I’m 10 and doesn’t care about me at all, and I’ve gotten into a few fights with her. 

And this is a simple situation that happened between me and them (recently) a month or two ago, to give you an idea of how they are casually with me. 

It was the evening , maybe 4-6 pm.

They walked in on my room, striked up convo with me as I was using an iPad that I had saved up for myself over the range of a few months. 

Everything was fine and we were chatting and laughing, suddenly, it turns into them severely attacking me verbally by questioning why I even got it, the first sister was telling me I was ruining their chances of my dad buying things for them and devices by telling them to do the same as me (the iPad was a used gen 10 in pink, 64 gigabytes.) it was extremely cheap which my dad is aware of. I kept explaining to them that he would never as he knows it’s cheap, and he wouldn’t just not buy them devices because I bought myself a very cheap device to play games and watch shows on. 

I was described as stupid, dumb, selfish, and a little kid. 
It happened aggressively and it was done in 2-5 minutes worth of speaking. 

After that, I left my room and cried and I went to my mother to tell her about this, they came and it turned into a big fight of me crying, the first sister lying about everything and accusing me of being manipulative and a liar, also playing the victim to my mom. (Second sister was involved too but not as much) 

After this, there was tension and she attempted an apology a week after. 

Anyways, many more situations happened between me and my family over the course of these months. 

And my mother is someone who’s easily influenced, but I’ll get to that result later. 


So, after explaining each one of them, and situations that happened between them and me or just them, I hope it gave you an idea to why as what I’m about to say is happening to me. 


I’ve been excluded by the family, they go out together and don’t tell me, my father left this week for my sister’s graduation and didn’t tell me till the day before and it was on a school week. 

I couldn’t do anything, or come or book a seat for the graduation, my two sisters and my mom and father went out and I was left alone with my little brother (who is too young to notice, doesn’t care and doesn’t know) in the community we’re in. 
And they went out for dinner and such. 


Also, my mom has been constantly ignoring my messages, never calling me, and I’d literally beg her to reply but she wouldn’t answer me at all and she doesn’t care at all. 

Whenever I arrive in the weekend, I’m welcomed with a hi while my brother and father are hugged and sat with. 

My sisters don’t text me nor care about me at all, and I have a strong feeling my mom and them are talking about me, because this is how they are when they severely shittalk me and exclude me, so it’s confirmed for me due to a constant pattern. 

I’ve never done anything bad to them, or did anything that affected the family. I’ve always been hated for situations and experiences that happened to me as a child that I couldn’t control. I AM IGNORED AND HATED FOR SITUATIONS THAT ONLY AFFECTED ME, THAT I COULD NOT CONTROL. 

There is so much more that they have done to me that I could not describe even if you gave me a 100 years to tell you, what I said was only the tip of the iceberg, and I don’t want to say anymore as it’s extremely late right now and I don’t want to cry in this cramped apartment 

I have no genuine friends, only people I sit with, that go out without me. 

I only have my partner that I am very very close to that my family can’t and doesn’t know about, he helps me so much but we’re gonna becoming long distance for 2-4 years soon and he’s already dealing with his own family problems that are much stronger than mine. He is literally the only thing I have. 

I am helpless. I’ve given out, I cry everyday, and I am so fucking confused and shaky. 

I don’t know what I can do. I hate my life, and I wish I could have a proper mother or father figure. 

I cry about how nice my professors are to me, I cry about meeting my friend’s families. 

I’ve had two male teachers that I’ve horribly cried in front of due to my problems. Please do not make this weird as no boundaries were crossed and I am an extremely assertive and strong person but it doesn’t show due to how I’m explaining my life situation, they are extremely caring people who have supported me in the smallest ways, and I will be telling my future kids about them one day.

The first prof, I’ve opened up to about my hate for the people around me and how my “friends” are, and I’ve cried in front of him really bad when my dad threatened to drop me out due to my grades, and he helped me out. 

He’s also pulled me out of lectures a few times due to him noticing my state. But I never shared much. 

The second prof, I am not as close to, but I’ve cried in front him after class due to a group project and he noticed that I was extremely sad and anxious. 


I am genuinely tired of life. I want to find friends even if it’s online just to bond with and be close with and there for. I struggled with so much more. I want help and someone to talk to, and I want to know ways I could improve my life by myself, such as hobbies and more. I game a lot which helps me and I’m very close with my sweet partner which id die for. And I also cry which helps, or go on dinner dates by myself and bike around at night, or I make myself a nice iced matcha. 

But I need more help, I need opinions and advice or literally anything. 

Say what you want, I am genuinely in desperation and I want hope in life and someone to show me my first step to greatness and happiness.

1kw53qa,I (20F) feel like I have to parent my little brother (17M),Affectionate_Use53,"i am the only daughter and i have 3 brothers haha. two of which are out of the house but i still live with my parents and little brother. honestly my parents have had an awful marriage (cheating, divorce threats, walking out of the house, fighting, etc.) which also led to their focus being “far away” from the kids, id that makes sense, so us siblings have been very close. 
my little brother is 17 now and kind of in a very important time in his life. he’s struggling in school, grades are low, acting out, angry/sad all of the time. it feels like my parents aren’t really there for him and or don’t really care? so i’ve been helping him with school, trying to be an outlet for his feelings, making sure he’s getting to events/school/practice, making dinners, hanging out, paying for his outings/private practices/food, and what not. but it’s just so exhausting and i constantly feel like i’m failing him. 
parents aren’t even super involved with his (or my) life. and they’re constantly yelling at us about something. i’m really trying my best to be there for him and be the person he needs but i can’t help but feel like i’m not doing enough. can anyone give any advice? i’m trying so hard.

1kw53ep,how to cut off family?,Middle-Scene534,"how do I cut off my family members? without hurting them? 

my family has always been my number one hater, they always have some negative thing to say about me (my appearance, my ""attitude"", etc) and never listen.

I reach out to connect and they always gotta say something negative about me. I tried to explain a situation that happened to me this past weekend (this panhandler tried to hit on me while asking for money) and suddenly im just an angry person who has nothing good to say when it was a genuinely scary situation? we dont live in a big city, i was in ATL for the weekend and had so many people begging for money and catcalling me. 

this is the first of so many incidents where they tell me I'm always angry or negative but when I tell them good things they dont care? I get a cool and that's it 

I tell them good things going on in my life all the time but never get responses to them so I stopped texting them about what's going on in my life.

I guess my question is how do I cut them off gently? I dont know they can handle me telling them what I think (because ill be the bad guy again) so im planning to just stop answering them unless it important. 

but any suggestions for me? I guess a therapist so I can have someone there in my life that will listen, its been years since I felt my family actually cared for me",4,5,1748292427.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kw53ep/how_to_cut_off_family/
1kw4xrv,Car argument that tore my family apart,Worried-Offer-7153,"So, it was a normal outing, and we were on the car ride home. My dad was driving, i was riding shotgun, and my mom and brother were all in the back. 

My mom urged my brother to lean on her shoulder, but he refused and slammed his head back into the car door window, where he was originally trying to doze off.

My mom yelled at him, scolding him for the attitude. My dad told her to leave him alone, and mom didnt have any of it. 

She started going on and on about how none of us followed anything that she said, and doubled down by saying it was in my dad's blood.

My dad raised his voice, yelling that she didn't always have the right to boss us around. My mom yelled back and at this point my brothers eyes got teary as i glanced back.

My dad then said that she was using us as an instrument to flex on other people, especially parents at school since we were doing well academically. 
That was the tipping point. 
My mom got extremely mad and started blabbering about how badly we treat her despite having given all her life to raise us.

The car got quiet, then after a while she erupted into screaming and tears and started yelling at my dad to let her off the car when we were not even a quarter of the way home.

She started to try and shove my brother aside to open the door in a car moving 140kph, opened it for a moment, and almost managed to jump out. 

This was when i started to realize that this was a really bad situation as i hear my brother and mother crying as they struggle. 

My mom was sobbing and yelling about how we treated her, and that we never cared about her.

In a moment of anger and annoyance, i bursted out confessing the many times i tried to kick the bucket after making her cry.

My mom had no reaction and was still sobbing. 

Then, just when i started to tear up, i heard my dad speak in a soft, shaky voice

""Please dont think like that.. You are all i have, i dont want to lose you.""

I cried. Really fucking hard. He held my head closer to his chest as he quietly sobs.

The person i see as the strongest man in the world, who i idolize beyond anything, is in his most vunerable state.

That broke me. I never saw him cry or even show a hint of sadness.

after, it was a quiet ride home.

This was the first time my family got into any sort of argument, and so everyone was shaken.

This morning (the day after), i awoke and went to get breakfast in the kitchen. I saw my dad, staring blankly into nothingness while eating.

I didnt know what to do, so i went back to my room and traced my face onto my pillow with tears.

My mom doesnt talk to us anymore, and swears she never will. 

I had to tear up the house to find my documents so i could go enroll, and before i left i tried talking to my dad, who still has not touched his eggs. No reply.

When i came back, he called me into my room. He bought me a birthday gift.

I had nothing left in me in order to shed tears, so i just hugged him for a really long time.

He is the only person that greeted me, out of my whole family.

I will hold him closer to my heart than anyone else in this shithole of a world.

1kw3yjo,Sometimes even little things help a lot,Willing-Sound-2301,"About a year ago, my life completely fell apart. My girlfriend left me, and it felt like everything just crashed at once. I didn’t really have anyone to talk to, and I kept everything bottled up, thinking I’d be fine if I just gave it time. But the truth is, I wasn’t fine at all.

I was scrolling through Facebook one night, just trying to take my mind off things, and I stumbled across this group called Pretend Family. I don’t even remember why I joined maybe I was just desperate for some kind of connection and  I’m honestly glad I did.

At first, I just watched from the background. But slowly, I started commenting, then sharing little pieces of what I was going through. The way people responded it caught me off guard. They didn’t judge. They didn’t give fake advice or tell me to “man up.” They just listened, related, and showed real support.

It didn’t fix everything overnight, but it helped more than I can explain. Knowing there were people out there even strangers who actually cared? That made a huge difference.

If you’re going through something, or just feel like you need someone anyone to talk to, check out Pretend Family. It’s not perfect, but it’s real. And sometimes that’s all you need.",1,1,1748289631.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kw3yjo/sometimes_even_little_things_help_a_lot/
1kw3hlo,Sister in law is controlling and ruining my brothers life,kittycatladyyy,"Long story short, my sister in law has always struggled with her mental health because of growing up with an abusive mother. She’s never really dealt with it or sought help. Covid happened and she’s basically spiraled ever since. First off, she became very sick with covid in 2020 and soon developed a phobia surrounding covid to the point of to this day she will not leave the house or go inside any public buildings. She never worked in the first place because of her anxiety. She forced my brother to find a remote job. She home schools their kids. They don’t go to the grocery store. No one is allowed in their house without a mask. They will only see family at outdoor functions. The kids have zero friends except their cousins who they can FaceTime. My brother has never been the type to be controlled. But he’s basically a shell of a person at this point. It hurts my heart for him and the children. Anytime any of my family tries to talk to them about this situation, my sister in law attacks us and freaks out. My brother does the same. He turns into a monster and acts like we’re heartless and don’t care about them. They both need severe psychological help but we can’t even suggest it or they freak out. Their oldest daughter is 8 and she already is crying for help and wants to have friends and go places. I have no idea what to do to help them. It started out as they just seemed extra cautious because of covid but now I think it’s a full on phobia of life itself. They are in a bubble and won’t let anyone in. I fear what will happen to the children as they get older if they continue to be isolated. Is there anything I can do or do they need to want help to get help? I’ve considered an intervention with my brother to try and help him see how much control she has over him but he just seems so tired and like he’s given up trying to help her. He just defends her.

1kw36un,In need of serious advice,YoBoyFrank,"Sorry if this is long but at this point I’m a bit desperate, I feel like this has shaped my family dynamic for years.
I’m also sorry if it feels cluttered, I’m not a native speaker.

Me (22M) and my mother (45F) argue frequently. My mom tells me that sometimes I tend to be sarcastic and that I don’t own my mistakes (An ex also told me the owning mistakes thing in the past and I will address it later in this post) she tells me that she feels like everything she tells me is wrong to me and I tend to dismiss it or mock her. I know I tend to be overly sarcastic and have already encouraged her to point out this type of behavior when she’s not feeling it. 
So she tells me that she can never say anything to me because when she does I get mad at her. But here’s the thing, I don’t really get mad when she corrects me, (I’m normally very receptive of criticism especially with friends and family) it’s always her tone and her yelling that I guess makes me go into defensive mode when we argue.

For instance, yesterday I told her that I was worried about my gut health and wanted to see a doctor soon because of some changes I’ve been noticing in my stool, I said this in a calm way. She started YELLING and scolding me because she had already expressed her concerns with my health (she pointed out I was being very irresponsible with my sleep schedule and usually skipped breakfast, but I’ve been hitting the gym recently, slept well, lost weight and all that stuff has normalized a few weeks ago, so currently I have a healthy lifestyle but she told me to go to the doctor to do a general check up for any deficiencies but I didn’t really want to do it because I knew I was fine (I also study medicine))

So when she started yelling at me I told her (calmly) to please tone it down, she immediately said she wasn’t yelling at me. She told me she was mad because I told her this 2 days prior to our family trip. But I just told her because I wanted her to know, I didn’t really wanted to rush a doctors appointment and was open to have it checked out later. It was a heated argument and I am in disbelief because I don’t think a minor health concern should trigger an argument of said caliber.

When she scolds me she says things that straight up aren’t true (like when she said she wasn’t yelling) or brings up mistakes of mine from the past, I always feel the stupid need of clarifying things for her and this only ends up flaring up the conversation.

For some context, I come from a very “gaslighty” family. My grandmother literally always gaslights my mom and makes her feel guilty about stuff and I know my mother does the same when it comes to arguing but today she started crying and told me what I wrote in the beginning of the post, she also said that my type of attitude was the same reason she fell apart with my dad (divorced) this comment on her part almost broke me but I stayed calm and just told her “ok” but I absolutely didn’t feel like it was.

-Am I in the wrong here?

-If you’re a parent, have you experienced from your kids the sarcastic/dismissive attitude my mom says she sees on me with your kids? How could I change this?

-How can I be more receptive when she shares her concerns with me and be less sarcastic? Sometimes I just feel she warns me of obvious things and worries about me to the point of obsession which I don’t think has ever been healthy/productive during my upbringing.

-How can I practice owning my mistakes?

-Has anyone been in a family with a similar dynamic/issues?

Feel free to ask any questions and thank you in advance.

TLDR: Mom says I’m too sarcastic and dismissive towards her but I just don’t like the way she speaks (yells) to me, how can I be more receptive towards her overly obsessive observations without hurting her feelings?",1,1,1748287689.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kw36un/in_need_of_serious_advice/
1kw1xdq,Baby due near Christmas…help me with some boundaries?,Massive_Ease_8125,"So we are expecting our second baby, due end of November, early December. December is usually crazy busy for us with multiple family Christmas get togethers and gatherings. My side of the family tends to be more relaxed with the gatherings, but my in laws are very particular in having multiple different gatherings. For instance, we have to do my MILs extended family, which is the second Saturday of every December (already hate having that scheduled for me every year), my husbands direct family, which can never just be a thing during the day, always has to be overnight because they want that Christmas morning feeling lol. Also we typically do NYE with them. 
SIL’s kids are always sick, and my in laws don’t really communicate if a family member is feeling ill ahead of time. I usually find out after we show up, because they know I wouldn’t go otherwise. 
My son will be 18 months at the time, we’ll have a newborn, and to be honest, I’m not interested in going anywhere for a couple weeks leading up to my due date (so I don’t risk getting ill before delivery), or a month or so afterwards with a brand new baby. It’s not worth it to me. MIL has already voiced (in nicer words), how this birth is inconvenient timing LOL. Sorry we didn’t plan conception based off of your holiday parties and plans. Husband is a pushover with his family, and also sometimes has his head in the clouds in terms of best interests of our child and germ exposure. (I.e. big fight between us with the birth of our last son and me not being okay with family kissing his face and him fighting that it was fine and he doesn’t want to upset his parents by telling them not to). 
All this to say, please help me with some boundaries that I can put into place ahead of time so I’ll be prepared for postpartum during the holidays!

He’s spent his whole life trying to be good to his family—his mother, his siblings—yet they’ve always treated him like he doesn’t matter. Like he’s invisible.

They look down on him because he’s gentle, quiet, and refuses to play their games. He’s never chased power or tried to take advantage of anyone. All he ever wanted was love and a place in the family. And for that, they’ve shut him out again and again.

When they recently divided the family land, they gave him nothing. Not even a conversation. Like he didn’t exist. He tried to act like it didn’t hurt, but I saw it in his eyes. I always do.

And what breaks me the most is that he still shows up for them. Still speaks kindly of them. Still hopes for love that never comes.

He sometimes tells us, “The day I die, these people will even throw you all out of your own house.” And I believe him. Because that’s how little they respect him. That’s how little they’ve ever cared.

1kw1ozx,Reflecting and Remembering,maureen1231,"Collectively, we observe Memorial Day as a nation. But the most powerful observations are often within our family and our community.

Many communities today are noting the occasion with parades and speeches, reflecting and reinforcing community values.

In military cemeteries, white crosses of fallen veterans mark beautifully manicured lawns in a sweeping scene of tribute. What if one of those crosses was absent? The entire picture changes.

Every cross matters.

Similarly, every voice in your community matters, including yours, even if you don’t know it.

In *It's a Wonderful Life*, George Bailey feels like a failure even though he is an integral part of his community.

He represents all of us.

We may not perceive a connection between our family history and our community’s.

But when you talk about or write about your life, you will undoubtedly mention the name of your town or city, the name of the street you lived on, the name of the schools and churches you attended, and a dozen other landmarks you frequented, like restaurants, parks, factories, and pool halls.

On its website, the Society of American Archivists states: “Whether or not members of your family attained a degree of fame … your family history becomes a part of your community’s collective memory.”

This is especially true on Memorial Day.

1kvzne0,Is it normal for a parent to become friends with their child's enemies and their parents?,Particular_Carob8100,"It's something I've been wondering for years. Aren't parents supposed to protect their children?
Since when is it normal to always side with your child's enemies because you personally think your kid is spoiled and a jerk?

To  never give your kid a chance to tell his or her side and  literally have discussions with the enemy when your child isn't even around to defend himself or herself? Then turn around and constantly schedule play dates WITH said enemy at THEIR house, so your child will be at their mercy (under the guise that you're trying to teach the child to be friendly) but say nothing when they do the things your child don't like because it's their house? Then punish the child for having an ""attitude""?

I feel like there's something very wrong with this because it shows that you're not really trying to get to know your child and you have something against that child. 

Am I wrong for feeling like this? I feel like family should stick together over strangers. I get holding family accountable for being jerks, but banding up with other strangers to corner and team up on a family member in a public setting when you can deal with it at home as a family?

1kvuij1,porn addiction father,throwaway0019202093,"Sorry for rough caption, not sure what to title this. Really looking for advice  to help me understand.

So for context, I’m 16F and I live at home with my 2 sisters, 18F and 11F. My parents are together and have a relatively healthy relationship. 

Yesterday, when scrolling through a dropbox folder with lots of childhood photos and more with my younger sister, we came across a large collection of pornhub links. I quickly exited and we both went quiet. Parents were sat across from us. This was my dad’s folder - as he is the only one who has editing access to the dropbox. This isn’t the first time i’ve come across porn of his - when i was 9 he left a pornhub ‘teen creampie’ page open on his computer, another time it was asian teen porn on his phone, and so on twice more. Not the first time, but this was the first time it was not left open but rather organized into an app. Obviously i think he placed the collection there by accident, but still not nice to see with an 11 year old. I left the room and briefly scanned through the different links- b i g centre around ‘ teen ‘ girls with larger men. Felt sick to my stomach.  Never told my mum before about the links but this time I told her and i’m guessing she confronted him as the access link stopped working that night.

I’m now wondering if this ‘ teen porn ‘ has connections to an event that happened to me? 

At 15, i had my first boyfriend of 3 or 4 months over and planned to sleep over. I’d assumed it would be okay as I have had a male friend sleep round before. At around 11 o clock , my dad got very very angry and said he could NOT sleepover, but when i demanded an explanation as to why not, he refused. Completely blanked me and said he didn’t need an explanation. To most families, this would be normal and chalked down to an overprotective father - but my dad is very loose when it comes to rules surrounding me and doesn’t fit into that role at all. My boyfriend loosely resembled the men in the video links i saw - 6,2, darker skin, etc. The male friend who slept over once before didn’t resemble them. 

i’m now feeling sick and wondering if his outburst at the time was due to a porn addiction, and him reflecting porn videos onto real life. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Just looking to feel less alone about my thoughts . :(

1kvs888,I don’t want to be associated with my dad’s side of the family.,itsjessmus,"[I already posted this in r/africanparents under a different title but I haven’t had any responses :(]

I (19F) come from a very different family compared to a traditional or even a ""normal"" african home. My parents are divorced (which isn't abnormal as we live in the UK) and my dad has 3 other kids from 3 different women. I have a younger brother (16M) whom I've grown up with as we both have the same parents, and I am not close to my 3 other siblings who were all born out of wedlock (not important to me but he is an ex pastor and very ""devoted"" christian and my entire family are also christian's - I am not - but obviously this is very frowned upon) who are 29M, 22M and, 1F.

My mum had no idea about my older brothers as my dad hid it from her and his entire family, and he had abandoned them (only occasionally sending money and speaking to them) which of course isn't their fault. My dad recently had another child 5 years after my parents divorced. I find it hard to bond with my older brothers (29M, 22M), and this could be because they live back home in Africa and I had no idea about their existence until i was about 10 years old, but even after my dad confessed we maintained minimal to no contact. This includes my younger sister (1F) who was basically a surprise baby. He had gotten a lady from his church pregnant (again absolutely frowned upon) and they had hidden the pregnancy. The only reason I found out is because a couple days after she was born I had visited my dad so he could give me a driving lesson, and she (the baby) was in the house and he dragged me upstairs and made me hold her whilst taking pictures (I was very uncomfortable and confused).

Recently my older brother (29M) had told me he is getting married, he has 3 kids (12M, 8M and 6F) and the lady who he is marrying has 2 kids of her own (15M, 13M) whom she had just before she graduated high school/college/sixth form. I was asked if I would attend the wedding, l gave a vague response as there is no set date and said ""If I can afford the plane ticket and if I am available I will try to be there."" But shortly after this, he had begged me for money, which I refused to give him as he has a history of alcohol addiction, nevertheless I would not give him any money because I am a 19 year old living off of student finance (I am living comfortably and have no complaints as it’s exam season and I’m just trying to survive this Chemistry paper if anything lol) and I have vowed to myself that I will not be giving any relatives money.

I am no longer close to my dad, as after my parents divorced when I was 12 he became a sh*tty father (there's a lot of stuff he did but l'm not gonna get into it), and I also realised he was just a horrible, controlling and contradicting person. I am at university so I want to make the next step in cutting him completely out of my life, this includes his entire family (all 9 of my uncles and aunts, and their kids) and potentially my half-siblings as I have no emotional bond towards them. This family stresses me the f*ck out, as everyday there's a new problem, whether that's financial, mental or physical.

FYI: My dad’s side of the family is sh*t, like they have their own problems which would take at least a century to explain. They are mostly to do with money, relationships (marriages failing and cheating), lying, addiction issues, lack of education, judging, lack of employment, stealing, lack of parenting, people popping out babies like they are loans and grudges that have been held longer than Mount Everest has been considered a mountain. (On top of that they were incredibly rude and disrespectful to my mum.)

Would I be wrong to cut them out of my life?

TDLR:  I am no longer close to my dad, and at university so I am planning to cut him and his entire family out of my life. However I have no idea if I am being too harsh on him, and my half siblings even though we have no emotional bond.

Sorry for the long post •_•

1kvovhk,Anyone else stuck in this weird guilt loop while caring for elderly parents?,deborahfesity16,"I’m in my early 30s, single, and still living in my hometown mainly because my mom’s health has been on a slow but steady decline. She's in her late 70s and not in terrible shape, but she definitely can’t live on her own anymore. I moved back a couple years ago to “help out for a bit” but now it’s just become my whole life.

  
I take care of all the errands, meds, doctor appointments, you name it. It’s not like she asks for it all the time, but I’m the only one close by. My siblings either live out of state or basically ghosted the situation. And now anytime I bring up maybe moving or doing something for my life, she gets all sad and makes me feel like the worst person in the world. She says stuff like “I don’t want to die alone” or “You’re all I have left,” and I just sit there feeling like absolute garbage for even thinking about leaving.

  
Don’t get me wrong—I love her. But I feel like my life is on pause while everyone else is out there doing their thing. Dating? Forget it. Career moves? Nope. Sometimes I even feel guilty for going to the gym or out with friends. Like… am I supposed to be a full-time caregiver forever?

  
I know a lot of people say “just hire help” or “put them in a home,” but my mom is super against both. And even if she wasn’t, I’d still feel like I was abandoning her. It’s like this guilt just eats at me no matter what choice I try to make.

  
Anyone else been through this? How do you deal with the guilt of wanting your own life while still caring for elderly parents?

  
Would love to hear from folks who’ve managed to find some kind of balance without feeling like a total monster.",6,4,1748246280.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvovhk/anyone_else_stuck_in_this_weird_guilt_loop_while/
1kvobta,"I want to move from my high-conflict home, but I feel bad leaving my mom and siblings behind.",instantnoodles733,"I F(21) am the oldest of 6 kids. My dad (M43) is an alcoholic and narcissist. He has been verbally abusing my mom (F41) for years, to the point where she has extreme memory loss of negative events. He has cheated on her also, and has done many concerning things when he was drunk like swinging around a knife once at her.

This has really broken our family. When the kids are little, my dad has an easier time manipulating us. He makes us like him by buying us treats and expensive things for birthdays and holidays. However, the older everyone gets the more resentment we hold towards him because of his behavior.

I have been begging him to seek help, whether it's therapy, doctor, priest, etc. However, he doesn't believe he has any problems and constantly blames my mom. He hates her, and she stopped loving him after being consistently put down. She has no self esteem, she feels like she has no potential in life. He made her be a stay at home wife. He yells at her when she tries to take care of herself because he thinks she cheating. She has no friends and only takes to her kids. She is very isolated and socially anxious. 

She is willing to try to therapy i think, but she's afraid to go out if its not to the store or for an errand concerning him or the kids because she doesn't want to deal with his fighting and accusations. He says disgusting things that make your stomach clench. 

I've been prompting her to get a divorce for a while but she is worried about the effect it would have on the kids. However, living in this high-conflict household has produced a lot of issues in all the kids. All of us that reached teenage years have developed depression, anxiety, extreme insecurity, disorderd eating, etc. Regardless, I don't think she will be pursuing divorce anytime soon.

My sister (F20) has already moved out. It was really hard for her because she is my dad's favorite child and he is extremely persistent. It was also hard on my mom. One of my aunts from Ukraine lived with us for a while and she was a great support for my mom. However, she moved away back to Ukraine in the Fall and the was something my mom had to get over. Then, shortly after, it was my sister who is leaving. She cried over it, which was big because she never cries in front of us. 

I really want to move out. However, I want to support my mom and siblings and maybe it's because I'm the oldest but I really want to try and fix things. But I've been trying for years, I'm exhausted and want to live my life. But I feel guilty and selfish, because I would leave my 4 brothers behind and my mom alone. My dad isn't violent, but living in that house makes one so dismotivated. It's debilitating. 

I don't know what to do. What has led me to this strong desire to move out is reflecting back on my life more. I remember my dad using physical measures to discipline us that were quite violent. I remember the swearing and accusations he made towards my mom. I remember the anxiety and fear. The fact that she gave birth to my youngest sibling all alone??? He never gave her affection, never encourages her. He never talks to the kids, just goes to his room and drinks. Then we have to sit awkwardly as a family for birthdays and gatherings. 

All these thoughts led me to confront him and the way he talked to me was exactly the same way he talks to my mom which shocked her. I dont want to see him or reason with him anymore. I'm tired of his drunk manipulative texts (""im going to leave"" ""i hope you'll be happy with your mom's new man""). 

But again, I love my siblings and mom and im just worried about them. I feel so guilty leaving them.

Sorry if this messy or has bad grammar. I'm a bit overwhelmed. I told my mom I want to move out and my brother (M18) is also planning on doing so and it's been affecting her a lot. ",1,1,1748244046.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvobta/i_want_to_move_from_my_highconflict_home_but_i/
1kvlt9x,"My mom is convinced that my dad is cheating on her, but I'm not 100% sure. Idk what to do.",CatQuiet4601,"This is kind of long because I don't know how to organize my thoughts. I've never posted on Reddit but I'm kind of spiraling rn and don't know who to turn to. I'm kind of scared my siblings will find this post...idek if this is the right subreddit, so I apologize if this is the wrong one.

My parents have been married for a little over 30 years now. My older siblings have already moved out, so it's just me and my younger sibling still living at home. We all have full-time jobs. My dad is retired.

Earlier this evening, my mom came into my room with my dad's ipad and showed me that he's been messaging some woman. I don't know her and I've never seen or heard of her before, so I'm certain she's not a family friend or distant relative. Idk how old she exactly is, but she's definitely much younger than my parents, no older than 40 for sure.

My mom showed me some of the messages they've exchanged, which are in their native language. I can speak the language, but I'm not fluent with reading so I couldn't understand everything. Based on what I could read from what my mom showed me, she's currently living in their home country in Asia (my family lives in Canada rn). They seemed to be telling each other what they were doing day to day, like my dad would tell her that he's currently out grocery shopping or about to cook dinner.

There were pictures being exchanged as well. Most of what my dad sent were of the food he was cooking throughout the week, meals he was cooking for us for dinner. Nothing scandalous. It's the same kind of stuff he would send to his relatives back home.

What really caught my attention was how the woman had sent selfies of herself to him, and sometimes selfies with her young child. I didn't see any mention of a husband/boyfriend, but I tried not to jump to conclusions, but what really punched me in the gut was seeing that he had been messaging her and sending her pics earlier today while he was out with my mom and me. 

I had taken them out to check out a local vintage market, and he had been messaging her while we were there. There was a necklace my mom saw that she debated on purchasing, but after a while she decided not to get it because she wasn't confident it would suit her. She ended up buying another necklace instead.

Later in the day, my dad had approached me and said he had bought the necklace, but to keep it a secret from my mom. I thought he was going to surprise her, so I let him hide it in my bag. He did this often, where he would secretly buy things for my mom and have me hold onto them until he gave it to her later in the day, so it didn't seem out of the ordinary.

I had completely forgotten about the necklace until my mom showed me that my dad sent a pic of that very necklace to this woman and sent a message saying something along the lines of how he's going to buy it. As I mentioned before, I'm not fluent with reading my parents' native language. The ""I'll buy it"" message is unclear to me. The pronoun he used could mean ""I'll buy it for her (referring to my mom)"" or ""I'll buy it for you (the other woman).""

The necklace is still hidden in my bag, and I feel sick to my stomach just thinking of the possibility that he bought it for this other woman and not my mom after she had shown interest in buying it.

Idk where to go with this. Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I'm still in shock and idk what to do. My mom ended the conversation with ""I'm just letting you know."" and then left my room and went to sleep. I've been in shock since because wtf am I supposed to do with that?

Part of me wants to confront him right now and demand he explain what the fuck is going on. But I'm so scared because I can't believe he would ever cheat on my mom. I want to still give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my mom and I are misreading it and are missing context since we didn't look at older messages, only the recent ones. I'm scared of throwing accusations and then being wrong about him, but I'm also scared that it's actually what my mom suspects. Another part of me wants to talk to my mom, but idk how to go about it.

Should I confront my dad? Or do I talk to my mom first? Talk to them both together?

  
TLDR: My mom showed me a chat my dad has with some woman living in their home country in Asia (we currently live in Canada) and is convinced that he is cheating on her. I'm not 100% sure because I'm not fluent in reading their native language and can't read all of the messages. But I saw messages that he had sent while he had been out with my mom and me. While we were out, he bought a necklace that my mom originally wanted but changed her mind and chose something else. At the time he bought it, he told me to keep it a secret from my mom, and I thought it was to surprise my mom because she seemed to really want it but decided against it due to the style of it. There is a possibility my dad bought it for the other woman and I'm still holding onto it. Should I confront him? Or should I talk with my mom first?",2,2,1748234542.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvlt9x/my_mom_is_convinced_that_my_dad_is_cheating_on/

1kvldsn,"Orphaned by Death, Abandoned by Choice",starfern220202,"When you lose a parent as a teenager, you expect the one who’s left to rise to the occasion—not the case.

I was 17 when our mum passed away. My sister was just 13. Our parents were still married when she died, and despite whatever had gone on between them, we thought Dad would hold it together for us. Instead, within a month, he had a new girlfriend. It didn’t stop there. One after another, women came and went.

Eventually, he met the woman who would stick around. She’s his fiancée now. My sister and I call her ""the witch."" The name might sound childish, but when you’ve watched someone swoop into your life, rewrite your family dynamic, and influence entirely the deconstruction of our relationship with our dad. I think my Dad is very weak, he does anything and everything for anyone else except his two daughters.

It would take forever to recount all the things she’s done to us, but here are just a few:

* She refused to feed my sister dinner because she said she “needed to lose weight.” That turned into an eating disorder my sister still struggles with.
* She accused my sister of being sexually inappropriate with our own dad—just for hugging him.
* On the five-year anniversary of our mum’s death, we asked Dad if the three of us could have dinner in her memory. He said no—*the witch* had to come, or not at all.
* She moved her own family into my dad’s new house. Her son, the same age as my sister, spread indecent photos of her around.
* She once told us that she *used to feel bad our mum died*, but doesn’t anymore—because we’re “bitches.”
* She lied about us to the rest of the family—twisting words, inventing stories. They sat us down and yelled that *we* were going to kill our dad by raising his blood pressure.
* We were never invited to family holidays. When Mum was alive, our vacations were a small beach half an hour away. Now Dad travels the world—with her.
* One month after Mum died, he sold everything of hers. We weren’t allowed to keep a single thing.

My sister got the worst of it. She was younger, trapped in that house. I was kicked out when I was 18, just a few months after Mum died. I had to find my own feet, whilst still dealing with the grief of my mum.. I cut them off for good a year ago, but it still stings, I try not to think about it - but it sucks.

We both feel deflated. We lost our mum—our best friend—and then we lost our dad too. Not to death, but to someone who turned him into a stranger. There’s no one else. Mum was an only child. Our nanny is sick. Dad’s family has cut us off, thanks to the lies they’ve been told.

So I guess what I’m really asking is:  
**Has anyone else lived through something like this? Does it ever get easier? How to process all this grief and trauma?** 

**I would like to hear anyones similar stories just to feel a little less alone.**

**TLDR**: Our mum died when we were teens. Our dad quickly got engaged to a woman who’s treated us horribly and turned our remaining family against us. We feel abandoned. Alone.

If a person got adopted and lived with their adopted parents for their whole life, then one day their blood parents show up, would they really feel a sense of connection or closeness to that person? 

Wouldn’t their connection with this newly arrived blood-mom a nurture thing more than a nature thing? Cuz naturally, animals love any being that treat them well and if the blood-mom was never there for them, there shouldn’t be any connection. The only reason why they feel connected would be because of social norms that says “blood family is important”. So ultimately the blood-mom should be no more than a stranger without the social norms…?

She says that he never says no to me and my brother, sometimes I feel like just giving up. 

Today after talking to her for a while i realised she has been through a lot, she has seen her mother's loss her brothers cutting of connection and the fact that my father has a great connection with his brothers just pisses her off. I understand where she is coming from being wrong is like a taboo, but she thinks she is always correct about everything about every damn thing, I love her so much and want her to be healthy, but she overthinks too much cries about every little thing and bring chaos, her usual is keep crying for hours and days not cooking not talking to anyone. And it's always the same, my dad is a hardworking man who puts his best foot for the family, though she appreciates her sometimes but she always just fights with everyone and never accepts that she can be wrong.

EVERY single thing i say, she’s quick to argue it, insult me, or prove i’m wrong. it’s so exhausting. i want to love her i really do but i’m too hurt. i’m currently on a vacation with my family and this trip has solidified my thoughts of going no contact. i cant be around her, it’s too triggering and depressive. everything she does makes me feel like how i did as a kid. i cant keep going through these feelings, my emotions are everywhere when i’m around her but i can’t help but hang on the hope that maybe she will change. but i know she won’t so i’m tired of it and i just want to go no contact. after this trip, i plan on removing her from all my social media and muting her calls and messages. we both go to college and the only time i will see her in person is for holidays and other vacations but i also plan on minimizing contact with her in these instances. am i bad person for this or should i go no contact? i’m so tired of it but i cant keep living like this, it makes me too sad. if you’ve had similar scenarios or have gone no contact with family members please let me know how you dealt with it and why you choose that option",3,3,1748226398.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvjfd1/i_plan_on_going_no_contact_with_my_sister_am_i_a/

1kvij88,Do I reach out?,MushroomAcademic4816,"Trigger warning: child abuse

I’m pretty sure this fits in rules, but I have three estranged siblings (two stepsisters one bio brother), I’ve been estranged from them since I was 13. My sisters are 17 & I believe going on 12-13? My brother is going on 15 this year. I’m currently 19, when I was 13 I was kicked out. My dad/ stepmom say it was because I was essentially a wild child but I’m not sure. They subjected me to a lot of abuse and I don’t remember much besides being secluded to my room for months with nothing, being screamed at, a lot of corner time, starving, just things that are so inhumane to do to a child. They made me terrified to be in their house and they made me terrified of my mom, when I was 13 I believe I had a nervous breakdown and after that they kicked me out to live with my mom who I was literally trained to be terrified of. From the point I was kicked out I wasn’t allowed to talk or see or even know about my siblings, & from my cousins account my name was considered a “bad word” in my dads house. They also told my siblings a lot of things that weren’t true about me, and my cousins, luckily I reconnected with my cousins and I’ve proven that everything said was not true a few years ago (I think two)? 

Now I’m 19, the last time I saw my brother was when I was 17 which is the only time in the past six years. My dad let me see him the day before they moved away to Mississippi (I’m in Georgia.) I haven’t talked to him since then, I was supposed to see him for my graduation but my dad fell through, I was supposed to get his number..I haven’t. And as of a month after my graduation I went no contact with my dad because of him borrowing money & not giving it back (this was important because I’ve been living on my own since I was 16, the money I gave him was rent money so it was a big deal). Now I have literally no way to contact my brother unless it’s through my other two siblings, I also am under the assumption my brother doesn’t have a phone since he’s autistic but I’m not sure. 

Today we found my two stepsisters TikTok’s, they’re both public, I could message them but I’m scared. I don’t know if I should, I don’t know what they’ve been led to believe about me from my dad & stepmom, and further more my dad/ stepmom have been divorced for two ish years. However my stepsisters still see my brother so I’m not sure what’s going on tbh. 

Besides that, the only thing I’ve heard is that my older of the stepsisters called my grandmama against my stepmoms permission a few months ago and told them she missed all of us. My grandmama is a drunk so I don’t know if I believe her but I want too..

I just need advice from someone whose been their done that, I’m 19, they plague my every waking thought and I’m not sure if it’s a good idea or not. I don’t know how to go about this or if I should even go about it. Any advice welcome. Thanks.

1kvh549,Having an estranged parent with Peter Pan syndrome is exhausting (rant),AffectionateNanny56,"I’m turning 30 this year and have recently connected with my bio dad after 10 years of no contact. His sister reached out to me and informed me that he was at death’s door about 6 months ago, and after days of soul-consuming guilt I decided to reach out to him. It turns out he had a mild cold and she was just guilting me into getting into contact with him again, but now we’re here and are chatting on a semi-regular basis.

For context, I moved away with my mother and her side of the family 2 years after I was born and for whatever reason, my bio dad decided to stay in his home country (where I was born.) We had a relationship over the phone for about 6 years where he would call me on my birthdays (I remember the calls being extremely strained and awkward) until I was around 8/9 and then I scarcely heard from him. He never paid a penny in child support, sent maybe 1 or 2 small gifts over my lifetime but never visited me or had me visit him.

I have been through some pretty intensive therapy over the years to deal with things like abandonment issues and identity crises, but speaking with him again is a little triggering to say the least. I was such an angry teenager and grew up in a part of the world where almost all of my friends had both of their parents, with overprotective, loving fathers who would do anything for their daughters.

I have very vivid memories of waiting by the door of our house on my birthdays as a child (9-14), absolutely convinced that he would show. I know a lot of people raised by single parents don’t feel the loss of the absent parent, but that simply wasn’t me - I wanted a father so desperately it hurt. Of course this turned into looking for approval and love from men in all of the wrong ways as an adolescent, which took a lot of therapy and mistakes to grow from. 

He doesn’t know any of this and I haven’t shared the extent of how his absence/my childhood away from him has affected me as a person. It doesn’t help that he has *chronic* Peter Pan syndrome. While my mother had to take on 3 jobs to keep a roof over our head and food on our table, he got to grow up relatively worry-free without responsibility. When we talk, he sends me voice messages about his plans for the week and videos of the new puppy he just got. Everything seems very jovial and without much thought. He loves horses and motorbikes and seems to have a new project horse or bike every week (both very cheap to acquire in his country) 

He has no plans for retirement despite nearing 50 and having quite a few health issues. I sometimes get the vibe that he’s very subtly asking (without asking) for a little money here and there, but this could just be me being paranoid.

I wonder if I should lay it all out for him and go into great depth about how teenage me would beat the shit out of 30 year old me for even entertaining a relationship with him. I needed him as a child, desperately wanted him to love me and cultivate a relationship with me, but now? I’m 30, married to my soulmate and am mentally, physically and financially better off than I ever dreamed I would be. I don’t *need* to have a relationship with him, and I don’t crave it anymore. But I’m trying to be gracious and kind like my mother raised me to be, so I listen to his voice messages and respond in kind.

Part of me thinks it would be nice to have some kind of relationship with the man, while the other part of me doesn’t see much point in it. I’ll be discussing this further with my therapist this week, but curious to hear from anyone out there who also has a parent with Peter Pan syndrome. It’s seriously like talking to a 13 year old boy when we chat and it’s such a strange feeling.",12,11,1748218912.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvh549/having_an_estranged_parent_with_peter_pan/
1kvf1ru,My grandma favors me and my mom says it’s unfair—am I the problem?,nightslimes,"I (14M) have always been my grandma’s favorite grandchild—it’s just really obvious. I’m the first grandchild, and when I was little, my grandma lived super close and used to take care of me almost every day. But when my younger brothers (twins, 8) were born, my grandma had moved about 6 hours away, so they never got to spend as much time with her. Because of that, my grandma and I have always been really close.

My brothers always bring up how unfair it is and say she only favors me. My grandma denies it and says she loves us all equally, but my brothers keep saying “lie” whenever she says that. My mom also says I’m the favorite, and she always brings up how she was the least favorite when she was a kid, so she knows how my brothers feel. But I think it’s not really about favoritism—I just had more time with my grandma because she lived nearby when I was a baby.

It’s starting to feel like everyone is making me out to be the bad guy when I didn’t do anything on purpose.

1kvexic,Mother hooks up with son-in-law JUICY DRAMA,roguemannequin_927,"I want to put one of my many family dramas out there to get some advice and also to share because it’s just too damn juicy not to. 

So…. this story takes place many years ago. Like early 2000’s. I was a child when it happened and didn’t find out until I was 28. Anyways…. The story told from my mom’s perspective is that she, my brother, my sister, my sister’s husband (BIL) were all partying and drinking. She didn’t go into too much detail other than that her and my BIL hooked up. My mom said she was drunk and blacked out and then he took advantage of her. She said she couldn’t move. She couldn’t stop him. He raped her. My sister didn’t know about this until 10-15 years later when my brother talked my mom into telling her. When my mom told my sister what her husband did, my sister didn’t believe her, said she was lying and made it up and stopped talking to our mom. My brother tried talking to her and tried telling her the truth and she didn’t believe him either and stopped talking to him as well. Not long after that I got a text from my BIL telling me that he misses me and asking if we can meet up and if he could take me out to dinner. I immediately got the ick and told my sister about it. I even had the texts to prove it. She then got pissed at me and said that I made it up and that me, our mom and brother were just trying to turn her against her husband. She thought we were all lying. It’s been 10 years since she’s talked to any of us. It’s killing my mom and myself. She feels like she lost a child and I feel like I lost my one and only sister (we were best friends). I also, lost a niece and nephew (her kids) and I since not speaking, I’ve had a daughter whom she’s never met. 

The story doesn’t end here though in fact there’s a prequel….

My sister met her husband when she was 16 and got pregnant. A few years after having the baby they got married. Another few years after that my sister was going through some papers in their office desk when she found a paper about child support with his name on it. She questioned him about it and that’s when he revealed to her that he had another child before he had one with my sister. So for YEARS he hid a child from my sister. When my sister found out she was devastated. Now that the rats out of the bag he wants to be in the child’s life. Then my sister gives him an ultimatum. She tells him it’s either her or the kid he hid from her. He told her that he couldn’t pick between the two and when he told her he would leave her she agreed to letting the child come around. 

So, after hiding a child from her and lying about it to hitting on me and lastly, raping our mother, she is still with the guy. She chose him over her own family and it’s truly beyond me. I miss my big sister and my niece and nephew more than anything. I don’t think her and my mom could ever make amends but I wish that she would reach out to me. I don’t think she ever would though. It seems like she’s on her high horse. I’ve tried reaching out to my niece who’s in her twenties now. She never texted back. I never did anything to her or to my sister to deserve this. I would think my niece would want to know our side of the story but I’m beginning to think my sister has brainwashed her. It’s just shitty that she stayed with a man who’s a liar and a rapist.

Just to add my mom and sister were super close. Best friends. The 3 of us were best friends. We did everything together. When my sister got pregnant at 16 my mom let her boyfriend move in with us and my mom helped raise the baby. My niece grew up thinking I was her sister that’s how close we all were.",5,2,1748212268.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kvexic/mother_hooks_up_with_soninlaw_juicy_drama/

1kvd72f,My mom is pregnant but she is a grandmother,GradeBitter1595,"Hi moms, I need to share something that’s been really weighing on me.

I gave birth 5 months ago, and my mom, who is 40, just found out she’s pregnant. It was a total surprise — she wasn’t trying, and for personal reasons, she doesn’t consider abortion an option.

I’m feeling completely overwhelmed. I was so happy when she became a grandmother — I thought we’d go through this new chapter together. But now I’m scared she won’t be as present for me and my baby. I feel like our bond is going to change, like she’s starting a whole new family, and deep down, I feel pushed aside.

I also feel jealous, and that makes it even harder. I don’t want to feel this way, but I do. It hurts knowing she’ll be going through motherhood again just as I’m discovering it for the first time. I really wanted this phase of my life to be special, and I imagined her being fully there for me and my daughter.

I feel guilty for having all these thoughts, because a baby is still a blessing… but I just need to talk about it. Has anyone been through something similar — having a baby while your mom is also expecting? I would really appreciate any support or shared experiences. Thank you so much for reading ❤️


EDIT: I wanted to clarify something, I’m not jealous of my mom. I’m happy for her, truly. But I’m going through a mix of emotions I didn’t expect, and I’m still trying to make sense of them.

I just had my first baby a few months ago, and I was genuinely excited that my mom was becoming a grandmother. Now that she’s pregnant, I’m realizing that things might not be the way I pictured them. I’m scared that we’ll grow apart, and that my baby won’t get to know her the way I hoped. She also lives in another country, so the distance already makes it hard.

This isn’t about resentment, it’s just me trying to process a big change I didn’t see coming. I know life doesn’t always go how we imagined, and that’s okay, I just needed a space to share and be honest. Thank you to those who offered empathy and understanding.

My kids (4 and 7) have gotten really into audio lately – bedtime stories, animal facts, and those calming mindfulness podcasts for kids. It’s been a nice break from screens, and they honestly ask for their favorite episodes like they used to ask for TV.

1. Are your kids listening to podcasts or audio stories too?
2. Which podcasts do you recommend?
3. What do they use to listen? (Smart speaker, phone, tablet, etc.)

I'm the stepparent to 3 amazing girls. A set of twins (15f) and a 7 year old female. The twins and the little one are half siblings on their dad's side. We have tried everything we can think of without blatantly telling them they have to be around her, we don't want to damage our relationship with them hence why we aren't forcing them to interact. We currently have them every other weekend and the little one comes over on the weekends they aren't with us. A big part of their resentment comes from them not liking the little ones mother, as well as them being teenagers and not liking kids. We have tried suggesting, to no avail, outings like going to movies or the park just to get them to to be near her. They blatantly refuse and at one point even cried when my partner said that they will have to be around her at some point. I am at a loss I don't want to push to hard and lose the respect and love from them that  I've worked towards by being  supportive and respecting their boundaries. The little one is absolutely crushed when we tell her her big sisters won't be coming to see her and it's breaking both of our hearts.

1kvb3tn,Need advice on what to do with my depressed sister,Majestic-Might-4171,"It’s hard to know where to start. I wish I had more answers but I don’t know how to help her next, so here goes nothing. My youngest sister is 24 years old and has struggled with depression for the last 8-10 years. My family experienced a traumatic event where our dad committed suicide in our home unexpectedly with zero awareness he was struggling with his mental health. This was before any of the mental health movements or any real knowledge of what mental health struggling looked like. I went to therapy for 3 years and after that I was able to reflect and see that there were some signs especially with his attention to robin williams death. After he left my mom became kind of a non-parent, and my sisters were still developing. They were 14 and 16 at the time of his death and I was 20. I went into college and continued trying to help my family. They ended up all going to college. My middle sister has a very strong willpower and is doing well, but our youngest hasn’t spent time in therapy very much and has a very negative view of herself. Any negative occurrences she finds a way to tie it back to herself and blame herself and almost self-validate the way she thinks about herself. My mom took her to get her brain scanned 2 years back (my mom is Eastern European and doesn’t understand mental health, but believed maybe the scan would explain my dads death as well) the scan came up that her brain no longer is producing Seratonin and they identified she was severely depressed. Ever since then she has gone to see one therapist for maybe 3 sessions and saw a psychiatrist about getting anti depressants and I believe is still taking the ones they prescribed but I don’t think just taking pills without working through and processing everything she is feeling is the answer. She doesn’t believe therapy works for her and it’s just getting worse and worse. I just need some advice on how to navigate this, and I know I am leaving out plenty more but there’s just no way to fully explain everything over the last 10 years. I almost feel like the next step is to find a licensed psychiatrist/therapist or someone who can point us in the right direction of what she needs to be doing. And like sit with her and tell them our side too. I just don’t know what to do but I do know not doing anything will eventually end the same way my dad ended. Any advice is appreciated.

1kvb0tp,"My mum makes it difficult for me to live with her mentally, but I'm a recent University student and cannot support financially due to caring responsibilities and my ADHD. Any advice?",CrimsonMeliodas,"Hi everyone! I’ve never posted on reddit before and this is an old account, so I majorly apologise if this is very lengthy or is hard to follow. I’m 18F, almost 19 and live with my mum, 51F, my stepdad, 31M and my younger sister 9F. I’m currently a university student finishing up my first year in university and the problems with my mother keep stacking up but have gotten worse throughout my year in university. I have chosen to stay living at home because of a few reasons, these including: I have to pick up my little sister from primary school every other week; I have high functioning ADHD and am currently on a 3 year waiting list for medication and don’t cope well with other people being within my safe space and have a hard time staying organised so my room is usually quite messy and unorganised, I also have a medium distance girlfriend who has autism and doesn’t cope well with being around multiple people she is unfamiliar with as it makes her uncomfortable, so living at home allows me to see her often while minimising costs and makes it easier for both of us to see each other comfortably. I want to also mention that my mum really likes my girlfriend and has no issue with letting her come over every month for a week or two, her and my mum get along well and she encourages her to come over often so that isn’t causing the issues I have. As I mentioned, I’m a university student and the only income I get is from student finance and that’s it. I am physically unable to get a job because I have to pick my little sister up from her primary school every other week, which means I need to be home to pick her up and babysit her for a bit until my mum comes back from work. Furthermore, I also need to then babysit my little sister on her school breaks, which can last from a week up to 2 weeks and then 6-7 weeks in her summer break, which will make me unable to get a job more than I already struggle. I also must babysit her throughout the week when my mum and stepdad go shopping or go anywhere because my little sister doesn’t like going with them anymore- she just likes playing on her tablet all the time. This means I always need to babysit her whenever they go anywhere, and this happens often throughout the week. I also have to skip quite a few of my Uni classes because they override the time slot that I have to pick my sister up, meaning that I also miss valuable teaching time within Uni and basically have to skip an entire week of Uni to pick up my sister. As I am only on student finance and am physically unable to get a job, I only rely on my student finance, which is extremely hard to manage due to my ADHD and how I must deal with all my personal costs, with no financial help. This is a problem because I have to constantly pay for prescriptions, my glasses, all my travel costs, my girlfriends train fare when she sees me and my own when I see her, all my clothes, new utilities and etc. Additionally, I also pay 200 rent every month to live at my house. This is meant to include all my food, water bill and electricity. However, these are all met apart from the food part. My mum usually pays for me to eat throughout the week by making meals at dinner time for me when it is group food, otherwise I make food myself. On weekends, my mum doesn’t cook because she says she can’t be bothered because of work, so she orders take out. I have to pay for my own share within this take out. Every time she orders it, she pays for her, my sister and my stepdad, but she always asks me if ‘I want to put in for a takeaway’, meaning I have to pay for my own food when she orders this. This bothers me because I pay rent, which is meant to include ALL my food (her words), but I have to put in for take out on a weekend because my mum doesn’t prepare dinner. If I say no, then I get no food, and she only orders it for them 3 and I’m left with no food from the takeout. These take outs aren’t fancy either, they’re just your average take out that you’d get from around the corner or something like that. If I say no, I then have to either order my own take out later on at night or I have to prepare my own food. This bothers me more than it normally would because I do not possess very good cooking skills. My mum has taught me no life skills, even though I’ve asked plenty of times when I was a teenager for her to teach me how to cook, use the washer etc. She refused. She never helped me, nor taught me. She said she would and then never did. Now that I’m 18, she expects me to magically know how to do everything and know how to cook. I can only make simple meals that you use an air fryer for or simple dishes like pasta or breakfast foods because I’ve not been taught how to cook otherwise. When I don’t know how to perform these skills, I am belittled for not knowing how, even though she hasn’t taught me when I’ve asked. For example, when I didn’t know how to turn our oven on, she came in and sighed, then said ‘for fuck sake op, how do you not know how to turn an oven on? You’re 18 now, you should know how to do these things, it’s not hard’. I replied back saying, ‘I haven’t been taught how to do it, and I have asked before if you could teach me, but you never did’. These comments from her are quite common, too. She says comments like that whenever I can’t do ‘basic skills’ because I haven’t been taught how to do them. Therefore, I have to either spend a lot of money a month on take out food or I won’t get fed, or I have to deal with belittling while I make simple food, which I personally don’t find really fair.

I also have a challenging time saving due to my ADHD and find myself splurging on things that are to do with my fixations, as I am a collector. This never overrides my rent or anything like that, I always have money saved in my savings for rent but paying for everything, including leisure is a lot of costs and I spend a lot of money on replacing stuff that I need, and paying for all the costs that come with being an adult. I’m not expecting her to help or give me any money to help me out, as I’m 18, it’s my responsibility to manage my costs. But, as I pay rent, I think it’s only fair that if they are ordering food, I should also automatically get my food too, instead of paying my own share, even though I also pay to live there. Now, feel free to criticise me on this opinion, I’m here to get advice after all, I just personally think it’s not fair. I have also spoken to my girlfriend and she shares the same opinion as me and thinks it’s not fair the way she treats me, but I also want opinions from an outside perspective because my girlfriend might be a little biased as she doesn’t really like my mum all that much because of how she behaves lol (which I’m not faulting her for at all).

Adding onto the leisure spending, my mum also complains about how I spend my money and always asks me how much of my student finance I have left in a snarky tone if you can see what I mean haha. This is usually when I buy something a little more expensive, like a new figure for my collection or new clothes or something like that. She usually asks that whenever I buy something expensive and makes snarky comments about what I buy and spend my money on. If I go out with my girlfriend a lot, she will make a snarky comment about my spending habits and belittle me for spending a lot, although she has done research into neurodiversity and how it affects things like that (due to my sister having autism). I was only diagnosed recently with ADHD last August, when my mum kept insisting it was autism for over a year when I told her years prior that I think it was ADHD. She didn’t offer to get me tested or anything like that when she believed I have autism, she just kept correcting me when I said I think I have ADHD and told me I was getting obsessed with thinking I have it. Her only reasons for believing I had autism was because I’ve had a fixation on a video game ever since I was around 5 and because I’m a picky eater. Furthermore, with the money complaining, she complains when I try making plans with my friends or have any plans with my stepdad because she is ‘going stuck with my sister’, so she essentially complains when she has to babysit my sister on her own, meaning I have to spend less time with my stepdad because she complains about having to take care of my sister or she can’t stand him being away from her for too long. However, when she has plans, I am automatically expected to be free to babysit my sister. I’m expected to cancel my plans and make myself free to babysit my sister so she can have her plans. This happens very often. She cancels my plans because she doesn’t have anyone else to babysit my sister and automatically expects me to be available for it, meaning I have to babysit my sister for a whole day and usually for the entire night if the plans are staying at a hotel or being away with my other siblings. This further solidifies why I can’t have a job because I would physically have no time for the job due to how much I take care of my sister. Adding onto the financial struggles, I have gotten my last student finance payment, which was paid at the end of April, and I have had to spend 600 of that on a new PC. My old gaming PC was very outdated as my brother gave it to me for free when he built his new one. That PC is very outdated as he used it for gaming back when he was around 14-15 and he is now 22. The PC lagged on any game and made it EXCEEDINGLY difficult to play games such as Fortnite as I’d lag just running around. The storage was also getting full as I used that for all my Uni work and it only had around 400GB of storage. I desperately had to get a new PC as my main hobby is gaming, and I need one for university. I spent 600 on my PC now because of how high end the PC is, it has a lot of storage, and it’ll last me a lot of years. My mum hasn’t changed her behaviour, although she knew I needed to buy a new PC. She has just been complaining more about my spending and looming over me saying I need to make my student finance last until September. I’ve been offered no help with the cost of this PC, which I didn’t expect as it is a lot of money, but I am still being asked to put in money for a takeaway every week and I have to pay for my own alcohol when I drink with them and get don’t get offered any. All other leisure’s need to come from my own wallet, which I understand, however, my PC has set me back a lot and I can’t afford to keep up with all my expenses being 600 down and not being able to get a job whatsoever. My sisters summer break is coming up too, meaning I have to babysit her for the entire summer all week and I won’t be able to get a job to support myself during this time, making this a whole lot harder.

This is quite long now, so I’ll wrap it up with this last point. My mum likes to humiliate me a lot and I’m sure she gets a kick out of it. I’ll explain. Since I have high functioning ADHD, I find it extremely difficult to organise myself and to help with this, I usually keep certain items like my wallet and such in a certain spot so I can always find it, otherwise it’s as if its disappeared haha. I also have the very known floordrobe that most ADHD people have. I would prefer not to have the floordrobe, but, I have no space in my drawers or wardrobe for most of my clothes because the wardrobe is taken up by her excess dresses, which take up most of the area in the wardrobe, meaning I’ve got a huge lack of space in storage of clothing, essentially meaning it has to end up on the floor. My disorganisation means my room usually ends up very messy and I get executive dysfunction when it gets messy, even though I want nothing more than to clean it. My lovely girlfriend is such an angel as she helps me with this as she loves tidying up as it helps her de-stress and she knows how much I struggle with keeping my space organised and tidy. She won’t judge and she helps me in anyway she can. However, my mum is the opposite and she humiliates and belittles me for how disorganised and messy my room can get sometimes. She purposefully waits until I am out of the house to go into my room to purposefully get herself angry so she can send me very passive aggressive texts telling me how disgusting I am for my space and how I should be ashamed and humiliating me. When I say she does this as soon as I leave the house, I mean it. An hour after I’m out, I’ll check my phone and there will always be a text about how disgusting I am. She purposefully goes in when I’m not there just to rial herself up about it and if it’s not when I’m out of the house, she makes snarky comments about my room and tries humiliating me that way. It makes it worse that she purposefully tries to humiliate me in front of my girlfriend to belittle me and make me feel humiliated about my own space. She will tell my girlfriend about my room and say to me ‘she wouldn’t like the state of your room when she sees it’. My girlfriend has reiterated multiple times to my mum that she doesn’t mind whatsoever and likes helping me because she knows I struggle and that her helping me clean also helps her destress. My mum replies to this saying ‘I don’t know how you can like going in there and dealing with it’, even though my girlfriend assures her that she struggles herself and likes helping me clean and organise. When my brother lived with us, he was worse than me. He was your average gamer boy who didn’t leave their room at all and was what people would call a basement dweller and I’m sure you can fill in the blanks for how his room was. Even then, he was never as humiliated and belittled as much as I am, even though I have a reason as to why I’m like that and have shown multiple times that I don’t want to have my space like that.

My apologises that this is long, there is a lot to get out as it is a long story and there are a lot of details that I have left out of this post for conciseness. I just want some advice and opinions on what I could do moving forward to try helping me deal with this as it has been difficult for me as it has just gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. All advice is appreciated and thank you so much for reading and any advice that is given, I’ll try answer as many questions as I can :).

TL;DR: My mum makes it hard for me to manage my own funds within my household although I pay rent to live there as a university student. I am unable to get a job to support myself due to taking care of my little sister for most of my time. She also belittles me because of lacking basic skills, how I spend my money and humiliates me because of my disability.

My sons 28 and his life is out of control, he is always drinking and doing drugs.  All his friends are unemployed and alcoholics.   My son has been fired from every job, he's always late or he stops showing up.

He parties for 5 days straight without sleeping.   He's been robbed, he's been beat up and ended in the hospital.   Last week he was arrested for public intoxication.   

He thinks he's badass because he was arrested, and came to my house laughing about it.  He also thinks it's funny that he got fired from his brand new job.

He says it's my fault that he's an alcoholic and drug addict.  He blames everything on me when he's mad.

I pay half his rent $300 because he's always broke.  Sometimes I wanna block him out of my life, but I'm scared he's gonna doo something stupid to himself.

I also don't wanna live with Anxiety all my life wondering if he's OK.  He doesn't have a father so I'm lost.

I've had serious conversations with him,  but he thinks I'm judging him and he gets mad.   He thinks life is a joke

1kv89uu,My single mother is threatening to kick me out the house because of my situation,Technology2006,"Hey there I'm a guy with autism who's turning 19 next month. I currently have no other relatives other than my single mother due to personal circumstances (she had a traumatic past even a few years before I was born) which makes me feel lonely and vulnerable (I was raised with very other little relatives around)

I expressed my feelings about wanting more family members (even if not biologically related) to my mother but she refuses to talk about it. I also do not have a good relationship with my mother and I sometimes argue and shout at her alot. I am also autistic so I also can't really do some basic tasks myself (like cooking food or washing hair) so I'll be even more vulnerable without a family. My mother does not have any family, friends, job or social life (she basically does nothing in her life other than shopping, akin to a groundhog day lifestyle)

Due to my severe argument and shouting to my mother today (relating to feeling lonely and wanting more family) she threatened me to kick me out the house and said ""I hate you"" to me.

 I want more family because I'm feeling very lonely and vulnerable with just a single mother (who I don't get along with) as my family. I would like a family who has a good quality of life (like having friends, a stable job and income),a good history and past (not an abusive or traumatic past) and is suitable for my needs (like autism). 

I'm not planning on disowning my mother (but my mother thinks I want to disown her because I want a new family) but I may prefer to live with a new family with a far better quality of life so I'm not arguing with my mother much anymore

1kv841y,My grandmother is being drugged by her husband and we don’t know what to do.,Inner_Fail_787,"
My grandmother used to be a strong and energetic woman, but everything changed a few years ago when her eldest son died by suicide. She was the one who found his body, and ever since then, she hasn’t been the same. She’s been on medication for anxiety and depression.

Just a few days ago, one of my cousins who lives in the same city as my grandmother (in Latin America) told us something really disturbing: her husband (not my grandfather—my real grandfather passed away years ago) has apparently been increasing her medication on his own, leaving her completely out of it, like she’s not really there.

Why is he doing this? Because he has a much younger girlfriend now and walks around the city with her openly. Everyone in town knows about it. Meanwhile, he’s living off my grandmother’s pension and the money our family sends her. He doesn’t work, and he’s clearly taking advantage of her.

None of her children live in the same city anymore. My family and I live in Spain, so it’s very difficult to take care of her from such a distance. I’m planning to visit her for a few days this summer to see how things are, but we have no real plan.

I thought about trying to convince her to visit us in Spain and then somehow get her to stay here, but I don’t think it would work. She’s very attached to this man and would never leave him willingly. And of course, he wouldn’t let her go either, because he depends on her financially and emotionally.

Has anyone been through something similar? Any advice on what we could do? I feel completely lost and really worried about her safety and well-being.",2,1,1748194283.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kv841y/my_grandmother_is_being_drugged_by_her_husband/

So the exclamation point on my laptop doesn't work, hence I had to put a dot.

I stand out in my family. I'm a highly sensitive person, an empath, and just don't blend it.

Because of that, my mom hates me lmfaooooo

I'm freaking out let me calm down.

My mom tries to get under my skin, and kind of make me suffer in any way she can.

She hears me say something she knows the meaning behind it because she talked to my psychologist so now she knows practically everything about me. It's torture.

My dad and sister agree with her to torture me.

Here's the catch; I'm bipolar. And have been since 2020..

They are hiding all their harassment.. Maybe because I'm an empath I feel it more than anyone else would. But they are being soooo insanely passive aggressive, and hiding the harrassment.

How the hell do I prove it. I have no ability to stand up for myself; I have side effects from medication and am hopeless...defenseless...can't really express myself.

How do I prove this. There has to be something.

I can swear on my life this isn't my imagination because I've been medicated nonstop since 2022. Soooo....

I've been helped on reddit with medication before, and it changed my life. Someone's gotta help me. The truth has to shine.

1kv4x6x,My brother blames me for not feeling welcome in the family anymore,FtMPussyBoy7,"My (29m) brother (27m) and I were never close, but we used to get along quite well until he moved in with his girlfriend (28f). They actually live with her parents in the countryside, like an hour drive away. My brother is in psychology school and his girlfriend doesn’t work. 
Things were still okay until I met my (now) husband (44m) two years ago. The first time I introduced my husband to my family, my mom loved him immediately but I felt like my brother and his girlfriend were both uncomfortable. 
After that, they avoided us as much as they could and found silly excuses to avoid attending family gatherings. When we got married last year, they only came to the ceremony and left right after because they « had a long drive home », and they didn’t come to the family party the next day without saying why. It made me sad but it made my mom even sadder and she ended up crying in my arms, on my wedding day (not the kind of memory I want to keep). 

Later last year, my brother and I celebrated out birthday together (we were born two years and one day apart) and his girlfriend refused to come. During dinner, my brother announced that they were going to get married next year, and that his girlfriend was pregnant. No one said anything except my grandma who shouted « how can you be so stupid » or something like that. 
Turns out my mom knew already. She had told them that they should wait until they were independent and financially stable before having a baby and that’s why the girlfriend didn’t come to our birthday. 
My brother didn’t react but stopped answering his phone for months. I had lunch with him once when he said that he was hurt by our grandma’s reaction and that he wouldn’t talk to her anymore until she would make the first step and apologize. I said it was immature of him, our grandma said what she thought like she always did and if he had a problem it was up to him to stand up for himself. 

Anyway he didn’t and he and his girlfriend didn’t come for christmas even though our grandma called him to apologize. I texted him that he was selfish and that he was hurting our mom, he didn’t answer. He showed up to my workplace a few weeks later to ask me to apologize because I insulted him by calling him selfish. Later, my mom told me that he had called her to say that he felt rejected in the family because I « took all the space » and that his girlfriend and him were uncomfortable around my husband and me because we were too extravagant. 

After that conversation, it seemed that things were going a little better. We had another christmas dinner in February that went well and my brother called me a couple times to catch up. 
But their baby was born last month and it’s like nothing changed. I asked him to meet my nephew, he refused and said he would call me when they got out of the hospital. That was a month ago, they went home three weeks ago, and I haven’t had any news since then. When my mom asked if they needed anything they said she couldn’t come to see them because they don’t have enough chairs. 
My mom only saw her first grandchild once. Now she asks me to act like everything is okay because of my brother’s sensitivity and that he doesn’t talk to me because I scare him since our « argument » at christmas and my husband doesn’t want to see my brother because of the way he treated us at our wedding. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I keep trying to maintain some kind of bond ? I feel like I’m chasing someone who doesn’t want me in their life and it breaks my heart because he’s my only sibling.

Lived 8 years in place A, moved to place B for 5 years (parents got divorced so my father went back to place A), moved to place C (with mum) for 2 more years, then only I moved to place A again for 2 years (to live with my grandparents this time). And i finally finished high school a few days ago. I have had an eating disorder for the past 7 years, struggled with SH, been verbally abused all throughout these years, (have adhd, not a serious problem but worth mentioning), and generally grew up in a very loud/angry/toxic household. 


I guess I am looking for someone to tell me I am not overreacting and that I have the right to feel the way i do. 

These past 2 years that I have been living with my grandparents, while having completely no friends and just being all alone, have absolutely crushed me. My grandmother's favorite phrase is ""others have it worse"". Something happened with my toxic and abusive father? ""Other people's fathers are murderers/rapists/addicts. You are fine."" I can't eat bc of my ed that all of them caused? ""Children in Africa are starving/these aren't real problems/ people are dying"".  

The same damn response for EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM. 

TMI (you can skip): 

These past 2 months I have been living alone on my floor because my grandpa broke his hip (and is currently on his deathbed) and he and my grandma have been living in my father's house so he could help them. Upstairs, lives my evil aunt (blood related) and evil uncle who literally wish me death and give me death stares when we accidentally walk past each other on our front yard (the reason: old rivalry with my parents). 

My aunt has been terrorizing me to the point I started having panic attacks. 2 months ago she stole the key for the door that connects our floors and all this time she had been coming downstairs whenever she wished and screaming at me because I hadn't opened the windows/had the curtains closed/ forgot ONE night the outside light open etc. For whatever trash reason you can imagine. AND WHAT THW FUCK DOES SHE EVEN CARE IF I HAVE THE WINDOWS OF MY FLOOR OPEN. 

It had gotten so bad that I couldn't even freely walk around the house out of fear she would come down, and only stayed locked in my room. Hearing the littlest sound and flinching thinking she would come down. 

So my father came to the house yesterday (he felt sorry for me because he also loathes my aunt (his sister)) and installed a second lock to the door so she can't come down anymore. She hasn't found out yet though so I am scared for when she does. 

And the only reason she hasn't kicked me out, even though the entire house has been passed on to her by my grandparents, is that my floor is my grandmother's till she dies, so she has no legal rights. 

END OF TMI.

1kv23c7,Mother doesn’t want me to find a partner.,BeyondStreet5591,"I’m gay M35 and recently moved from Los Angeles to the Philippines to be closer to family. My mother accepts that I’m gay but she doesn’t want me to date and eventually find a partner. It’s like she expects me to become her gay best friend/assistant/driver/caretaker for the rest of her life. We don’t have much in common to the point conversations run dry. She often judges my interests and invalidates my feelings, which is why I don’t particularly enjoy spending a lot of time with her. Thoughts or tips?

Also, I came home to join the family business but I’ve taken a step back because my mother doesn’t actually let me participate or learn anything. She just likes taking me around to her errands to show off that her son in back in town and be stuck spending time with her. The little they give me to do isn’t actually real work, but just busy work to make me “feel” useful, as if she thinks I’m dumb enough to believe I’m being given real duties. I feel like she wants me to be dependent on her financially.

My brain feels like it hasn’t fully developed and I’m 28. I’m a fuckjng adult and can’t do anything right. 

I want to change my name again because I’m going in a new chapter of my life and want to start fresh but I keep worrying what everyone will think about me. I keep thinking everyone will judge me and perceive me in a negative light. I am afraid to be seen as “crazy”. It bothers me so much. I can’t function at all. I need help which I see a therapist once a week. I feel like I need additional help. I will talk to my therapist about this issue more in our next appointment but usually, my mind is allover the place. 

I love my mom but being around her feels like I’m walking on eggshells. She always stares at me literally and then denies it (sis noticed too), she kinda guilt trips me into visiting, she judges people especially women, i always feel this urge to please her. 

I came out to her as queer and nonbinary and she basically made it all about her and brought up randomly my depression, that I get sad all of a sudden and don’t want to hang with her. She started being defensive. She’s very hypervigilent and paranoid. I grew up in a strict household.

It’s funny because I’m the oldest yet act the youngest and my younger sister is living her life on her own in another state. 

I’m also neurodivergent, I have ocd, depression and anxiety plus CPTSD.

My sister, Who I'll call ""B"", has been blackmailing me since we were wee little. We both still live with caretakers which makes the shit I put up with worse for having my private information exposed. I'm not allowed to have a tablet in a family member's house. Correct, A TABLET, so I have been keeping some shitty galaxy tab for my discord and art. I have a VR headset but can't draw on it and she takes my phone. I'm NOT EVEN IN SCHOOL anymore, and I have a time limit on some of my devices at this family member's house. So, I snuck my galaxy tab in as I am staying in america for a week to a month. (unsure) — My sister, who is 14 practically, knows these houxe rules and is threatening to blackmail me.

  
This isn't even the FIRST time it's happened. I keep seperate devices because privacy. There are friends, or past romantic/s\*xual conversations I admit to that I don't want SEEN, and since the home owner is shitty they use time limits to control what we do. They are not my parent, but they excuse it as ""living under their roof"". Or because she's transgender. ME. TOO.

  
I don't want to be kicked out. or have my shit, my PRIVACY looked into, my art, because she is heavily religious and I'm a gay person who does gay shit with other gay PEOPLE. Image mixing that with a homophobe.

  
It can be argued that it's just a sibling thing, but it is actual terrifying.. how do I tell a 14 year old not to get my ass in some deep shit?-

1kuvhaw,caring for family,Quiet_Lunch_1300,"I live across the country from my elderly dad. My mom died last year. My brother lives near my dad. My sister also lives out of state. 

For the last ten years, I’ve gone home A LOT. Usually twice a year. Last year I went home 4 times. I went for a month last summer. I have prioritized spending time with my folks because they are/were elderly. 

My dad is getting close to the end of his life. We have been asking him and my mom to move somewhere without stairs at least, or to a retirement home for many years. My dad always said he didn’t want to force my mom to move. But now that she’s gone, he still doesn’t want to move. 

His health has taken quite a downturn, and we are asking again that he move into a retirement place. It isn’t safe for him to be by myself. He is refusing. So we suggested that he get 24 hour in home health care. He is refusing. 

He has the money. He would be spending our inheritance, not money that he himself will need. 

I have to imagine that moving out of your home must be incredibly hard. I understand him not wanting to, so I’ve never pushed too hard. But at this point; we are all losing sleep worrying about him. The vast majority of all stress and worry and work lands on my brother. The same when my mom was ill. 

Now I’m getting ready to go home, and there’s this expectation that I will be his caretaker while I’m there - because no one wants to insist on him getting home care. Going home is my only vacation this year. I have other family and friends I’d like to spend time with while I’m in town as well. 

I’ve been prioritizing visiting home for ten years now. Always paying for my own flights, despite my dad’s wealth and my lower paying job. 

I love him and I want to help, but I am also frustrated. I have my own chronic illness that I struggle with. My dad is a good man, but he wasn’t a nurturer or caretaker for me when I was sick. 

I want to help my brother out - lessen his stress since he’s the main one there. But spending 24 hours with my dad for 3 weeks and not being able to spend much time with other people during my only vacation isn’t sitting well with me.

1kusm5x,My 39 year old step dad has a crush on me (a 17 year old girl),Flutterbug56,"I honesty feel sick to my stomach thinking about this but i found this information out the hard way. So i was round my mums this weekend and my stepdad lives with her. My mum felt very tired from having no sleep the night before so she went to bed whilst me and him stayed in the living room. Whilst we were sat together, he stared to caress my leg which he had done last weekend. However, i thought that this was in an affectionate manner. His hand traveled further up my leg, making me feel quite uncomfortable so i pushed him away. He kept doing this until i eventually got up to “pet the dog”. He questioned this action and told me to sit back down by telling me that i know what he wants to do. Luckily, this ended when i excused myself to the bathroom. 

Whilst i was in the bathroom, i rung my dad and quietly explained what happened and he immediately got in the car to come and pick me up. During this time, i stayed with my mum as i knew that my stepdad would not do anything around her. My dad then picked me up and i just cried the whole way home. I honestly do not want to see that man again after what he did and i cannot believe that he would that to my mum. She loves him so much and it will break her heart when she finds out the news. However, she deserves to know and if i don’t tell her then my dad will. As of now, i have not told her but she will know in a few days when i have calmed down. I will update you guys once she has found out. 



UPDATE: Thank you so much for the advice everyone. I sent the video to my mum 2 hours ago and she has made the decision to split up with my ex stepdad. Understandably, she is devastated but she has made the right decision. I did later receive a message from him saying “thanks, no i have no one” and i am questioning myself but my mum needed to know.

1kuqnt6,"My sister and I are constantly arguing, is it always my fault?",woopdedoop_op,"Me and my sister are 3 years apart, and we were honestly really close growing up. We'd do everything together and I'd always be following her around begging her to play with me. Right now, while I'm 17 and she's 20, we argue or she gets mad basically every week about something. Usually it'll be about how I'm treating her, for example the other day we fought because she wanted to tell me some of her ideas, and I wanted to listen but I really did have something to do and I also had school the next day. (She didn't have school the next day, as her school is already over) So I decided to listen for a bit, maybe like 5 minutes, give my thoughts and then go to our room (she was in the kitchen) to do what I had to do. Our house is small, so we were able to just talk from our separate places, but then she got mad about how she was talking to a wall and that I'm not interested in what she's saying. Naturally, I can understand how she could feel that way so I told her I am interested but I need to do something, so I am doing both at the same time. Multitasking. That only made her more upset and we had an argument about how no one ever wants to listen to her and how I'm always so uninterested in what she has to say. We've had this argument many times before and I get why she would be mad but I feel like she should know that she won't be getting my full attention if it's almost the time I need to sleep so I can wake up for school the next day, and I need to do something. And today, I had to run down to the 99¢ store next to our house very quickly because I needed to shower and sleep early since we are going on a family trip early tomorrow morning. So I burst into our room and as I'm changing quickly, I ask her if she needs anything from the 99¢ store. She says no, but then she asks if I can buy her chips which is from the supermarket across the street from the 99¢ store. I told her I'm not sure, since I have to go get stuff from the 99¢ store quickly since I was already behind schedule to shower, and I need to wake up early to make sure we don't leave late tomorrow. I asked her if she could just go down with me so I can go to the 99¢ store and she can go to the supermarket and then we'll both have our stuff in a very fast timeframe. She got upset and pouty, saying ""forget it"" with a very annoyed tone, and I sighed and continued changing before I asked her that if I did get it, what flavor chips does she want. She got all mad and told me repeatedly ""just forget it. You're not gonna do it anyway."" And I told her that I would. To which she mockingly says ""oh now you wanna get it? Just forget it, don't buy it."" Which made me upset, since I'm so lost on what she wants. Like do you want me to get it or not? So I tell her that I'm getting it, and since she won't tell me what flavor she wants I'm just going to choose what I think she wants. She gets even more mad at me and telling me to not get it, while I argue back to her that I'm getting it because it's my money, and if she doesn't eat it I will. And now she's mad at me and won't talk to me. Honestly, I dont know if I'm such a terrible sister that whatever I do makes her so mad, or if she's just upset all the time? I have done things that upset her before, but I tried to make up for those already and I didn't think something so small would spark a fight. She's always mad at me whenever I tell her I can't do something because I have to sleep, or I have something to do, and it makes me so confused because is she mad I have a schedule? Or certain things that need to be done at a certain time? I wish we wouldn't fight so often, but it's like every little thing I do pisses her off.

1kupwu9,My narcissist sister is stalking me,fili_the_boy,"(Fake names for privacy)

I (20F) need to vent and maybe get some advice. I’ve been dealing with my narcissistic 19-year-old sister 'mai' for years, but things have recently taken a scary turn. 

I cut mai off in April after years of toxic, manipulative behavior. The final straw was a trip to London I paid for so we could see the TommyInnit show together. Instead of being grateful, she stole my power 
bank and acted like it was no big deal. That was it for me, I went no-contact right then and there. The powerbank was replaced by her support worker after the police visited her house. 

Since then, mai has been stalking and harassing me nonstop online. I’ve blocked her on everything, including websites I no longer use, but she keeps finding ways to harass me through fake accounts and mutuals. It’s been mentally draining. Luckily my mutuals are wise to her after years of dealing with her trying to mix stuff up and also dealing with her sudden changes 

Just a few days ago, things escalated. Mai threatened to break into my flat and steal money from me, and worse, she still had a spare key from before I cut contact. I was terrified, so I called the police. Thankfully, they took me seriously and managed to get the key back the same day and offered me the option to press charges. This is currently pending as I'm trying to get a protection order. 

she’s also been threatening to bring her ""gang"" of friends over to break in with her. She hasn’t physically shown up yet, but the threats alone are frightening since she did the same thing 2 years ago, where I had to call the cops to get her to leave. I feel constantly on edge since I'm a part time wheelchair user and I can defend myself if she actually breaks in again. 

It’s upsetting to have to treat my own sibling like this, but I’m realizing more and more that blood doesn’t equal safety. I’m still trying to process it all. 

Has anyone else dealt with a sibling like this? How do you protect yourself mentally and legally from someone you used to be close to? 

Me and my partner are trying to move away so she can't be a danger to me anymore. Since she's now taking illigal substances wich make her more violent.

1kuodng,My mom is threatening to cut me off emotionally and financially if I move in with my long-term boyfriend. I just graduated and feel stuck.,Klutzy-Comb-7846,"I’m 22 (f), just graduated from undergrad, and I recently accepted a job that will pay me $85,000/year. I’m planning to move in with my long-term boyfriend into a one-bedroom in NYC where we’d split the rent.

The problem is my mom. She’s very controlling, and she’s threatening to cut me off completely—not just financially, but emotionally—if I move in with him. She’s never met him, won’t even give him a chance, and hasn’t given any specific reason for disapproving. It feels like this is more about control than concern.

This isn’t new behavior. She’s always been extremely picky and uses money or guilt to try to control my life. She’s told me in the past that if I marry someone she doesn’t approve of, I’ll get no inheritance. Again, I know that’s her right, but it’s painful because she ties love, approval, and support to obedience.

I’ve been careful with money: I have about $21,800 in savings/investments across different accounts, no debt, and I plan to contribute 20% to my 401(k). Even with my rent share, I’d still have enough each month for living expenses and saving. So I can afford to live on my own. But emotionally? I’m torn. I love my mom and don’t want to lose her over this. But I also don’t want to live the rest of my life being afraid of upsetting her.

She’s made it clear this wouldn’t just be a fight—it would be a complete cutoff. And that’s terrifying, even if I feel like she’s being unreasonable.

Has anyone else gone through something like this?

* Did your parent eventually come around?
* How do you make a decision like this without being overwhelmed by guilt?
* Am I crazy for wanting to go forward with this move, even knowing it could hurt my relationship with my mom?
* And how do you cope emotionally when a parent uses love and support as leverage?

Any advice, perspective, or even shared experiences would help. I feel so stuck.",10,18,1748128066.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kuodng/my_mom_is_threatening_to_cut_me_off_emotionally/

Two years ago, my sister had an online affair. I knew about it but didn't encourage her to pursue it beyond online conversations. They exchanged photos and she bought him gifts. Though I suspected he was using her, I felt powerless to say anything—I knew she wouldn't listen. The affair ended after a couple of months when her husband discovered it. Since then, our relationship has changed.

Recently, while staying at her place to visit her and her children (whom I'm very close to), we discussed what happened. She implied that I should have done more to stop her from talking to this guy. Her husband has also been distant, believing I had an obligation to tell him about the affair. She seems to blame me for not intervening, but even when I did speak up—like when I told her she was overreacting about this guy ""cheating"" on her with someone else—she wouldn't listen. I reminded her that they weren't in a real relationship and that he was likely trying to get money from her, but she remained upset about the ""cheating.""

During our conversation, I learned that her husband had hit her several times after discovering the affair. When I pointed out the irony of her husband expecting me to tell him about the affair while I'm supposed to stay quiet about his violence, my sister defended him, saying she ""deserved it."" This shocked me deeply.

I don't know how to maintain our relationship anymore. She's changed since the affair ended, and her belief that she deserved to be hit disturbs me, though I didn't show it at the time. While I'm close to her children and feel like their second mother, I can't maintain the same closeness with my sister. I don't want to cut ties completely, but I can't be as close as we once were. I'm at a loss about how to move forward—questioning whether I should have told her husband about the affair and whether I'm somehow at fault.",3,1,1748126062.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kunp2j/i_have_a_difficult_relationship_with_my_sister/
1kunksp,My younger sister is saying I have traumatized her,Head_Track_3523,"
Hi Reddit,
I’m looking for some honest advice or perspective on a family situation that’s been weighing on me.

I have a younger sister (she’s 17 now), and our relationship is really tense. Recently she’s been saying that I traumatized her growing up and that she resents me for it. She gets triggered by almost everything I say or do and often lashes out at me with a lot of anger or rudeness. When I try to address it, her response is basically: “You caused me trauma, so I have every right to feel this way and act this way toward you.”

To be fair yes, we used to fight a lot as kids. I’ll own that some of the things I said or did were wrong. I was a kid too, and I’ve worked on myself since then. I’ve changed a lot and don’t behave the way I used to. I’m not making excuses, but I’m not the same person I was at 12 or 15.

What’s hard is that it feels like she’s weaponizing the past to justify her current behavior. She expects to be treated like she’s still 10 and can say or do anything without being called out. But she’s 17 now, and I think she needs to start being accountable for how she treats people too.

I also suspect there’s some jealousy at play. My older sister and I are close in age, so naturally we hang out more go to bars, clubs, events, talk about things that are relevant to people in their 20s. I think that makes my younger sister feel left out, and it just adds fuel to her anger toward me.

What really hit me is that I overheard her talking to her therapist and she said she genuinely hates me.

What’s kind of ironic is that I barely even live at home. For the past 4 years I’m usually away for university in another city far away and spent the whole of last year living in another country. I barely had any communication with her during that time. I’m only back this summer because of an internship, and even then, I’m working most of the time. But ever since I got back, she’s been cold, rude, and constantly lashing out.

I’m trying to be understanding, but I also feel like I’m being treated unfairly for things that happened years ago, while any effort I make now gets dismissed. I want to make things better, but I also don’t want to keep absorbing anger I don’t think I fully deserve. This is also the first time ever that she’s bringing up that I caused her trauma and she’s always constantly bringing up the past and getting angry over it.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How do I show empathy without enabling hurtful behavior? And how do I set boundaries with a sibling who sees me as a villain?

Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Edit (final):
It seems like many people here have had really painful or even traumatic experiences with their own siblings. Some middle-aged commenters seem to think I’m their bully (I’m still really young) or that this is their story, and it seems like they’re taking that pain out in here. I truly wish them peace and hope they’re able to heal and this helped them get stuff out of their chest. But my story is not like yours or the same scenarios.

To everyone else thank you for your advice. I genuinely just want peace and in the future I don’t want to have a bad or non existing relationship. So I’ll be having a conversation with my sister to understand her perspective and try to make things right. I won’t be checking or responding to this thread any further.",30,95,1748125706.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kunksp/my_younger_sister_is_saying_i_have_traumatized_her/

She used to tell her friends that I hated her but I wanted to be like her.

I had gotten used to her bullying me and being mean, so I kept my distance from her and avoided her whenever I could because her treatment took a very string toll on my mental health. She had a history of apologizing, promising she’d change, she’d act better for a little while and then go back to bullying me.

As I said, I’d gotten used to not being comfortable with her and just not talking to her because of the reasons mentioned. 

So, right now, I haven’t received any apology but she suddenly started ackknowledging me and being sort of nice… but I’m not sure if I’ll ever feel \*normal\* with her again, after all that has gone down between us. I feel like this makes me the problem but I am just so afraid of her hurting me when I least expect it. I’m tired of being treated as a disposable toy she can pick up whenever she likes instead of a real human being.

1kuijvp,How to protect my children and respect sib in-law's privacy without destroying my marriage?,Clear-Telephone-3212,"Trigger warning: child abuse and SA

I need advice regarding a complicated situation with my in-laws. Going to try to keep this as vague as possible for reasons that will become evident. This will also probably be long, because without all the context, my dilemma doesn't really make sense. It seems straight forward, but it doesn't feel like it is. All the context will help explain my various reservations. 

One of my spouse's siblings is the outcast of the family. This is a family where some of the siblings can admit their parents ventured into physically and emotionally abusive territory when they were younger. I've heard various stories from various people, some of the siblings downplay it... so I'm not 100% sure about the extent of it, but it was at least worse than your average strict, religious, boomer parent. Bad enough that my spouse says other strict religious parents didn't want their kids spending the nights there. Yet, most of the siblings have a better relationship with their parent than they do each other. In my opinion, all of their kids need therapy. Though none of them believe in it. I won't say they're all bad people, but I wouldn't be surprised if their all their exes started a support group.

I say all that to give some perspective on the one single outcast child. They've been rejected and shunned by their parents and their siblings just kind of followed suit over a decade ago when most of them were just becoming young adults. Again, being vague on purpose, but it was a shitty reason to shun your kid. It wasnt justified. But, like I said, all the siblings need therapy and I have to have my guard up around all of them all the time, so it's not like the outcast is the one innocent and well adjusted kid out of the bunch.

Before the ousted sibling (OS from here on out) tried to get back in contact with the rest of the siblings, I was told stories portraying them as manipulative, unwell, and a pathological liar. My spouse was honest about why the parents wanted nothing to do with them, and it was a bs reason and I felt awful for them. Considering the parental shunning and traumatic childhood, the shitty behaviors I heard about made sense, but I also took those stories with a grain of salt. Biased storytellers and all that.

When I first met OS, they were incredibly kind. It was nice meeting and I was glad I could have a genuinely good relationship with at least one of my in-laws. They did share some problematic stories about family members, like anecdotes about them being racist when they were kids... but having known those specific people for a few years, the stories didn't at all surprise me. Not that they had been blatantly racist in front of me before, but just... things Id picked up on at some family gatherings. So, I believed them, but also felt like they only shared the stories in an attempt to further alienate me from their family so they'd be certain they'd have an ally in me. The way and timing the stories were slipped into conversation felt like they were weapoinizing a family history of racism against my race to manipulate me into being on their side, not because they were genuinely trying to warn me or anything.

This pattern continued. Whenever I said anything remotely positive about a family member, OS had some sort of horrible story about them. If I ever gave a sibling the benefit of the doubt, even over something as small as not staying in touch enough after reconnecting, OS would one-up themselves with another anecdote of said sibling being a shitty person so that I couldn't possibly defend them. Again, these kids are all the product of their traumatic childhood, so the stories were always believable. But timing was just always convenient. OS only pulled out these stories if it seemed like I wasn't siding with them or didn't dislike someone enough.

Like I said, my spouse told me beforehand OS was a pathological liar... and I did catch them in some lies occasionally. Like pretending to be at a place to gain pity when they weren't even in the state. They had told siblings they'd been involved in covert ops or high profile assignments. I'd also caught them sharing private information I trusted them with with their estranged siblings they hardly spoke to, so I know now they aren't the confidant they said they were and to keep myself guarded around them. I took a big step back from talking to them, but am still here if they need me. 

And that is why I am struggling with this latest revelation. OS recently told me one of their siblings sexually assaulted them when they were kids. This is a sibling that recently has been really involved in the family and trying to bring everyone together. They are the one sibling every other siblings gets along with. They tried to reconnect with OS recently, both were open to it, but both said it didn't go well. The Accused because ""OS was up to the same old shit"" and tried say they were involved in secret missions or whatever when they were catching up. OS just said Accused Sibling (AS) was still a dick. Following the usual formula, OS told me the story about the assaulted after I had mentioned AS having a more active role in our lives... which makes sense. Finding out your loved ones are getting closer to your abuser may make you feel like you should tell them the person they're letting into their life is a monster.

In addition to OS being r*ped (idk if reddit requires censoring) by their sibling, they shared that they were punished when they tried to seek help from their parents as a child. They said their dad called them all sorts of horrible things and then, as additional punishment, ""turned them over to the deacons"". I knew their dad was physically and emotionally abusive throughout their childhood. He's mellowed out in his old age, but the past abuse is why we don't really leave our children alone with him. But what OS said is a whole other level. That is dark and twisted and evil.

Based on what OS recently told me, I obviously do not want my children around their grandparents or AS.  I asked OS if they'd ever share this with their siblings and they said no and that I better never tell my spouse either... which I completely understand and immediately told them it's not my trauma to share.

...But what do I do when my spouse wants to know why I don't want their family around our kids. Despite the abusive childhood, they have a decent relationship with their parents and they have helped us out when we're in need and been great grandparents to our children. My spouse is also closer to AS than they are to any of the other siblings. If I put my foot down and say they're not allowed around our kids anymore for seemingly no good reason, my spouse simply won't have it. It Will probably result in a divorce, because, from their point of view, I'm just randomly deciding to permanently keep our kids away from their family.

If I betrayed OS's trust and told my spouse what they shared with me...all hell would break loose. There's a decent chance my spouse wouldn't believe OS due to their history of lying and manipulation. If so, they'd probably be furious OS is accusing AS of such things and would probably tell AS or confide in a different sibling. As a result, OS would probably end up being confronted of verbally attacked/harassed by at least one of their siblings. That's not something any victim should have to go through.

The only way to keep the peace, maintain my marriage, and respect OS's privacy is to do absolutely nothing at all and let AS and their parents around my kids. They're also our default babysitter on the extremely rare occasion we need one. Obviously I'm not comfortable with that. I am unwilling to sacrifice my children's safety for anything or anyone. I couldn't live with myself if something happened to them and it was completely preventable because I knew better...

So what do I do? I feel like I only have bad options. If the allegations are true, I know my spouse with side with me and keep the kids far away. But the truth of this family's history is so muddled and they were honestly too young when most of it went down to even have any idea of how dark their family history could be. I want to be there for emotional support for OS, but this secret, the trauma, they've shared with me and my promise to keep their secret will probably result in the dissolution of my marriage. And I also can't protect the kids from my in laws if we're divorced and sharing custody... and it feels so selfish to think about it in those terms, but I don't know what to do now.


TLDR: Sibling in-law shared they were assaulted by a sibling and church deacons (at the invitation of their dad) as a child. They're also known as a pathological liar and ""pot stirrer"" so unsure if my spouse would believe me even if I told them, but sibling in law also specifically told me not to. How do I protect my kids from the alleged abusers without destroying my marriage for denying spouse's family access to kids for seemingly no reason? Can't protect them if we're divorced.",1,6,1748111739.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kuijvp/how_to_protect_my_children_and_respect_sib_inlaws/

1kufchm,My mother is confusing me,Winter_Analysis7857,"Im bisexual male, and my mother struggles with it.

My entire family does they dont understand anything about me other than my father thinks im bisexual my mother thinks im gay. Basically no questions asked 

What essentially happened was my mother couldnt deal with it . 
Decided she would just ignore me for 2 years despite the fact i never once said a thing about it.

Scroll forward she still ignores me doesnt communicate

It takes me to have a moment and think right wtf is going on for my family to awknowledge what they are doing to me . They are basically shutting me out and when i am the only one communicating and i respond to the way they respond to me . Blunt , brief and passive . They instantly respond with do you want to come over .

I think basically they cant deal with it, they shut me out and me because i am not going to sit and take it without drawing any attention to it and treat them the same way they suddenly become caring.

realistically though as soon as i stop they will very likely returm to there old ways and my guess is they dont really want me to come over anyway

My mother is unreadable these days. This is a women who used to ring me weekly, ask me to go for walks, hikes, out for meals, ask me over for dinner. To go camping with my sister and her or to go to family events.

The past 2 years not so much as a phone call infact she has had my sister over for dinner, for family events the christening of my cousin baby girl. Everything has resumed as normal . Me i have been erased from the family.

And i never said a single thing about my orientation.

My mother continues to act like i dont exist but when i respond the same way suddenly she asks me wpuld i like to call over. It is truly bizzare

I mean if she cant accept who i am JUST LET ME GO 

 i basically respond with ""all the best to you"" in other words look lets not bullshit around im not going to hang around forever but im also not goimg to allow you to continue to neglect me like i dont exist so "" all the best to you "" means goodbye. 

Because its extremley selfish of them to not just neglect me a there son but to not allow me my own closure of telling them i know what your problem is and im not going to stick around for it pretending its not happening

I think in that instance she asks do i want to come over. Why does she do this JUST LET ME GO . Stick to your morals because i will have to force it myself

Obviously i dont because its not exactly genuine is it

So here we are again my mother and father think.they can keep me held on by a tooth string and im just goina be cool about it. 

I basically either need them to grow a pair or let me end the relationship with them fully disclosing why

They seem to think i will just stay quiet and continue like this because they just cant face the fact my orientation is none of there buisness. 

They have basicallly stripped me of my privacy and then neglect me like i am not even alive  and they will turn around tomorrow say i do actually call over and they will just continue acting like i dont exist

To me it seems like they want to pretend 

They dont want me around but they want to pretend there good parents or that they want me at arms length .   Realistically thats not healthy for me. Your either a family member or your not and you cant just expect me not to call it out 

Just burry there head in the sand until what theyre dead and gone 

Your either my family or your not why cant they stop being such cowards about this. They cant expect me to have to do all the mental work to call this what it is.

Honestly i wish there were a bit more vocal because i wont be controlled by silence you either are my family or you arent 

They basically just dumped this on me by total neglect estrangement thats just an excuse what they are doing is not facing it at all . Like whats going to happen when there on there death bed think ill be around still or will i have decided to live my life  and move on they arent facing anything and its disgusting to be honest that they dont have the balls to communicate with me like a human being 

So i feel like im going to have to force communication to get closure preferably i would like to end the relationship because  forat theyve completley run over my privacy they dont know the first rhing about my orientation but act lile its been set in stone and 2 there will always be that low level hate which i feel when im around them i know what it is and they cant expect me to accept that . So this is where were at there phobic reaction to something they dont understand something they never actually asked about and apparently just assumed i mean fuck them for doing this to me personally i dont believe the relationship will work . How can i fix this like a human fucking being

1kuerc4,I dont know what to do,Potential-Yogurt139,"Hi, I'm 17m and the youngest of my family, and right now I'm sick whith heavy exams all of next week. My parents are away on a trip and I'm struggling with keeping up with it all because my siblings refuse to help with anything. I have one brother who is 21 and on holidays from college and one sister who is 18 and also on holidays. 

Both of them spend their days either on their PC or phone, while I cook, clean, and take care of myself and I'm getting sick of it. It's always been like this with any extra bit of work being impossible for them to do without instruction from our mom, but now she's gone and I'm left to do everything while also studying for a major exam week. The only good thing is that (at least) my siblings somewhat keep themselves fed (with my brother eating sandwiches and sister mostly pasta or pizza), but a problem with that is how little they clean up after themselves. Right now I'm looking at a crumb filled counter with the crust of a pizza hardened onto a tray, a pot with overcooked noodles stuck to the bottom, multiple plates and glasses in the living room by my sister, a toasted sandwich maker with half burnt and melted cheese cemented on, and *three* separate loaves of bread left in the pantry with only the end slice left in each.

I on the other hand spent almost 3 hours yesterday making a big pot of stew that was supposed to last a while, but now only has about 1 serving left. (And yes I actually cleaned up after myself). I dont expect them to feed me, but I at least expect them to contribute some other way if they dont want to make food.

Now, the problem I'm facing is that i dont know how to get them to do stuff. Im the ""irresponsible younger brother TM"" so I'm scared to just ask them, but at the same time I can't keep going like this. I have to keep the house clean for when they get back because it's what's expected of me, but I also have to study, cook, and take care of my sick self. Are there any tricks I can use to get them to face their own messes at the very least? Should I just be a rat and tell my mom? Please give me advice.

TLDR: I need a way to make my siblings clean up after themselves instead of me doing everything while my parents are away.",1,1,1748101847.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kuerc4/i_dont_know_what_to_do/

Not a single day goes by where there is zero screaming or zero anxiety. I've ranted about it enough and just talk to my parents decently because they pay my university fees. I keep coming across so many people who just never realise their privilege. It IS a privilege to come from a happy family, and it IS a privilege you should acknowledge. So many of these people take their family for granted, don't understand what it means to people like us, and just unnecessarily create drama with their family.

1kuaykf,My family life,Jim-neutron576,"I speak to adults but they just told me to just do it a problem can be long gone somebody steps in to say something that listen my family is a very believing family they believe in anything each other says so when a possibilities presenting itself they take absolute caution for that to to happen because in their eyes a possibility is a reality and that possibility is high in their eyes no matter how low it's like it presents a threat someone presented with these suggestions I'm scared of my own family what they will do to me if I show any further defiance anger is not tolerated that's the last thing you want to do in the household about being terminated I haven't done anything bad since 5th grade two years without anything and they say I'm too violent I'm too unstable I fight too many people it's been 2 years 2 years since I ever did anything I went past the radar but what I got in return was a slap to the face with insults that can make anybody commit suicide especially by your own family it hurts I understand the strict household it gets to a point where I think they don't understand me be thinking some criminals they think I'm some bandit that's going to be homeless begging on the street smoking cocaine

Our tradition is submission and absolute obedience towards elders no questions no nothing and anything interpreted as defiance will be thought as you being somebody in crime it's like you committed a felony I'm not overreacting I'm telling you what is happening from the past years I've been here and I can only express this through messages as nobody else in my family would understand I don't possess the amount of Haitian words to express what I'm feeling

I understand strictness but when the strictness goes to the point where you are assuming that I'm going to fight a police officer just because I refused to give a phone makes me really concerned that they would put more assumptions on me I just want to grow up faster and leave I want to become my own person I want to become my own successful person I'm defiant of course there's no doubting yet I have taken multiple scoldings they got more harsh it has gotten to the point where I don't even listen to them anymore where did they get the new fighting a sheriff and me getting deported is it because what and the downside is there like I come from a Haitian household which is both a very bad thing and a very good thing depending on what type of parents you have they told me I was useless in Haitian they told me I belong in Haiti they told me I'm already spoiled I'm rotten I'm nothing I belong in Haiti to eat s***I'm not even making that up I'm not saying that out of furious they said it and I have nobody else to talk to inside I'm asking what did I do wrong because this is all started they forced me to put on something it was really uncomfortable but they forced it on me anyways didn't allow me to express my emotions it was pent-up they wouldn't understand  it feels like the school's more home than my house at this point does it make any sense at this point if I'm not needed or wanted why should I be here definition why not sending me to someplace else to not be defiant

I always knew my family has a very toxic family when it comes to verbal abuse and my pants are the type of parents to take a defiant act as something that can make me go in prison in the future they don't acknowledge my anger they don't acknowledge anything the only acknowledge of how I'm a selfish kid they don't find the deeper crevices they just see the surface as assumptions are made such as when I'm in the future I'm going to fight an officer and get arrested was there assumption because I didn't want to give the phone and because of that thought that I would slap them and punch them in the face they never see the real potential in me they just want me to die did I say that in a literal sense because they said that more times than I can count and my mom being the goody Two-Shoes she is my mom would tell my family which is a fatal mistake to me because they grow up off obedience obedience is what they want they don't care how you feel I have to learn that the hard way you don't care what age I was they said I was crazy they said I was mentally unstable they said I can kill people and I was only 7 to 4 at the time I was different I was not obedient I was questioning when I told you they're verbal abuse was not holding back they said insults like I was a grown person although they did not do it when I seek advice all I got was go with the flow almost committed suicide was thinking about it one time

I understand the need for discipline and respect but the words that they say to me is extremely harsh I wish they just understand me more there's some days I just cry internally as I go to sleep my mother can't say anything my family gives her the perception of I'm a very bad kid that causes defiance I hope this message serves you well please just try to be as nice as possible even if it's hard you're not the only one out there

my brother is a textbook narcissist. he has been abusive my entire life. Verbally, physically, and emotionally. I don’t know if i’d call it SA, but they were a few instances where he has made me uncomfortable with his seemingly sexual gestures. Or maybe I’m just gaslighting myself into thinking it’s not. After years of psychological abuse, and I am still working through it. He had just had a baby a few weeks ago and he’s christening her today. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a while now, and we have spent a majority of our time together. Luckily he’s super understanding of my situation. And wasn’t upset with my brother said no he can’t come. I thought about it and I decided I don’t want to spend my time around people that make me miserable. Around someone that’s gonna make me feel like shit and insecure about myself. For example when the daughter was born, my family and I went to the hospital to see her and he spent a good half an hour “jokingly” belittling me, and when I had left the room for a moment, he took that opportunity to start talking crap about me and my job which I walked into and felt like shit because my entire family was joining in on it.

I don't have a lot of friends, but I have one with whom I spent my entire childhood together. He is my brother for life. His house is just nearby and I would visit him more often and share everything with him. He is an introvert and a silent guy. Yesterday I discovered something. My dad is having an affair with his mom, 44f. 

Dad's laptop was turned on and he left somewhere. I opened it up just to turn the mobile hotspot on but suddenly found few pictures of dad and my friend's mom together and they have been dating each other. Few pictures of them together on bed too. I opened his WhatsApp, X, facebook etc but I caught him as I saw their chats on snapchat. He is calling her wifey everytime. I observed through the chat and later I discovered ""the lady's daughter(friend's sister) is my dad's biological daughter"". My mom would break if she knows about this. I quietly came back and lied on my mom's lap. Mom is a very innocent lady and would never bare this betrayal.

I never taught my friend's mom would do this. She is a generous, kind hearted lady who would gracefully feed me whenever I visit her. And I don't know why she and my dad did this. Her daughter's age is 7 and I think dad is having this affair with her for atleast 7 years, even when her husband was alive who passed away 4 years ago.

1ku63e6,My brother has failed to launch and is relying on our mom to take care of him and his daughter.,Chubby-Labrador,"Looking to see if my feelings are valid and for advice for what I can say to my mom. Shortened (if you can believe it) because 37 years of drama is a lot to type out. 

My (33f) half brother (37m) has failed to launch into adulthood. We were raised together by our mom (74f) and my dad (81m) who raised my brother as his own once they were married when my brother was 3.

We were raised with the same opportunities. We grew up in an affluent area, went to great public schools, and our parents had the funds to send us each to college without needing to take on debt. He was never interested in school. Flunked out his freshman year in high school, parents sent him to a boarding school for troubled teens that he flunked out of after a year, he went back to our local high school where he was kicked out for flipping a desk at a teacher, was then sent to a neighboring high school where he didn’t graduate. My parents eventually held his hand long enough for him to get his GED when he was 24 or 25. He spent from age 18 to 30 living in my parents basement either living off of them, getting social security, or working an entry level job and either getting fired or quitting by not showing up.

At 30 he got his girlfriend, who also lived in the basement, pregnant. The deal with my parents was that they would find a place to live before the baby was born. They did not, and brought the baby back to the basement to live. My mom took the baby away in the first week when she heard my nieces mom screaming at her to shut up when my niece was crying. My mom has a rental property about an hour from where they live. Eventually they came to the conclusion that my brother and his girlfriend were not going to look for a place to live, so my mom evicted her tenants from her rental property, they fixed up the house, and moved my brother and his family in when my niece was 6mo. The deal was that each of them would pay my mom $500 per month in rent (totaling about half of market rent for the area).

His girlfriend did not last long in the home before she left with the baby and started a custody battle. My parents paid for my brother’s lawyer, and he ended up with full custody and his ex bounced out of his daughter’s life and has never returned. I believe he receives less than $100 per month in child support. 

My niece is now 6. My brother is no longer working or receiving any income (other than child support). He spends his days sleeping and his nights gaming. He said he cannot drive for Uber any more because his car is making a noise. He has stopped paying his $500 per month in rent. My mom has made several upgrades to his home to make it more comfortable for the two of them. My mom pays his bills, she does his yard work, takes care of his mail, and pays for my nieces babysitter. She picks my niece up every Friday and takes her for the weekend and all holidays and drops her off at school on Monday. She goes over every Wednesday to do homework with her, she does her laundry, buys all of her clothes and school uniforms, pays for her health insurance and manages her doctors appointments, she bathes her and does her hair on the weekends. She spends every summer with my parents where my mom pays for her camp, she spends winter breaks with my parents and goes camping with them on spring and fall breaks. Santa knows to visit my parents house because that’s where he can find my niece, and my mom takes care of her birthdays. My brother does not bathe her regularly, make sure she changes her clothes or underwear, does not make sure she brushes her teeth or hair or make sure she goes to bed on time. He doesn’t sit down to do homework with her or keep snacks in the house for her. He recently said he thinks she can just come home on her own if she has her own house key and take care of herself while he’s not home and she doesn’t need supervision. 

I have received alI of the information about my brother from my mom since around 2016. I RARELY speak to him. I went NC/LC after graduating from college. Not because of his failure to launch, but because he was emotionally and verbally abusive to all of us when I was growing up and did not stop when I moved back home after college so I left and went NC/LC. I speak to him when I see him rarely at my parent’s house. He was invited and attended my wedding and he is invited to my home every Christmas Eve. He has been blocked on my phone and all forms of social media for years, but I maintain a great relationship with my niece and talk to her multiple times a week when she’s with my mom. I also see her frequently when I go to my parents house. 

I was talking to my mom yesterday, and she said that she told him she would not be able to support two households for much longer. She said she has no time for her own life or responsibilities. She has said she would cut him off SEVERAL times in the past, so I do not believe this time will be any different. He knows how to get what he wants from her. He knows she will never let him or his daughter be homeless, and he is taking full advantage. 

My husband and I are expecting our first baby in October and after our combined parental leave is finished, my mom has agreed to watch our baby three days a week at my parents home. My mom has a history of spending the majority of her time and energy focused on my brother and niece. My brother and I each live an hour away from our parents (in opposite directions). She travels to my brother’s house multiple times a week, and has said I live too far away to visit. She only comes over for Christmas Eve or Thanksgiving and cannot find my home on her own without getting lost. We have lived in the same home for 7 years. When I was getting married she did not want to help with anything other the finances (they agreed to pay for my dress and the caterer). In the past few years I have struggled with cancer and infertility and she never wanted to visit me in the hospital or help me through recovery. She only offered to help financially, which was very kind and we are thankful for (they paid for our IVF medication after insurance). Her justification for helping with our IVF meds was because she helped my brother buy a new truck (that has poor gas mileage so he cannot use it for Uber). When I asked if she could visit me in the hospital to meet our baby when he arrives, she grimaced at the idea and said it depends on where I give birth. When she found I would be giving birth less than 10 minutes from her home, she said “oh, okay. I think so.”

I have a suspicion she will back out of helping us with childcare due to her being too busy managing my brother’s life and raising my niece. I grew up being extremely close to my maternal grandma, and want the same experience for my kids. I feel like they will never be a priority compared to my brother and my niece. I also feel like I am responsible for my own relationship with my parents. They do not reach out to me unless they need either my help or my husbands and they do not visit. They come to me for all computer or phone help and ask my husband for any heavy lifting help they need. They do not ask my brother for any help because he is so unreliable and “annoying”. I do not want to be entirely responsible for my children’s relationship with my parents if that makes sense. I want them to want to be involved in my kids lives.

Am I right to feel like my parents (mainly my mom’s) lives revolve around my brother and that he’s taking advantage of them? It feels like my parents have bounced me out of their lives because I have successfully launched into adulthood and they don’t need/want to worry about me. I don’t know how to verbalize my thoughts about their priorities and concerns about their relationships with my future kids not being important to them.

TLDR: Brother has failed to launch and had a child. Parents enable behavior and coddle to brothers every need. OP feels like second thought after successfully launch into adulthood.",19,28,1748072411.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ku63e6/my_brother_has_failed_to_launch_and_is_relying_on/

1ku37ma,AITA: My husband wants to sponsor my MIL to move to Canada and I feel trapped.,Electrical-Screen-20,"My husband (39M) and I (36F) have been together for 7 years - married for 4 - and are currently expecting our first child. We managed to emigrate to Canada after meeting in the US & I've since become Canadian. 
I love the life that I'm building for myself here - I have a good job, I'm developing great friendships and the quality of life is brilliant. I miss my family, but I know I couldn't have this quality of life in my home country. That said, living here has it's challenges and I've lived in several countries before landing here so I'm always open to the idea of moving on if it's right for us. 
My US-based MIL is struggling with untreated depression and navigating the challenge is putting a serious strain on my relationship with my husband. She is immensely isolated - her daughter/husband's sister moved states with her children 2 years ago - and she doesn't have good relationships with her own siblings or close friendships. She's talked for years about being ready to sell her home and move somewhere new, but since we shared news of my pregnancy her depression has become overwhelming. She talks of how terrible her life is, becomes very emotional on phone calls to my husband, and is deeply upset that she feels she won't get much time with her new grandson. 
My husband promised that he would look into visa sponsorship to bring her here, and my attempts to flag my concerns have so far been wholly unsuccessful. I've tried explaining that unless she's prepared to get serious help for her mental health, she's going to be miserable wherever she is. That seeking happiness outside of herself doesn't work and puts a lot of pressure on us. That I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that she could entirely uproot her life to be close to us and then be dependent on us for all her social needs. That I want the freedom to move on if it's what's best for our family and I don't want to be tied to this particular city because someone else is keeping me here. 
My husband keeps telling me that I'm not reading the situation correctly, but then doesn't explain his perception of it. 
She is a good and kind person, and it makes my heart ache to know she's struggling like this, but at the same time it is neither of our responsibilities to fix or carry her, she needs to take responsibility for her own happiness. 
AITA for trying to shut this down and not being more supportive? Should I suck it up and let him move ahead with his plan to sponsor? I can't shake the feeling that we're being manipulated - intentionally or not - and it's clouding my judgement.

He often antagonizes me, and really makes me feel down on myself. I’ll make dinner, and he’ll announce that he’s not hungry and will have leftovers instead. I make banana bread, he tells me that I could have used more banana and less salt. Always criticizes every aspect of me and my life. 

In all honesty, I am not that kind to him either. He was horrible to my mother, cheated on my step mom and then was a horrible boyfriend to the woman he had an affair with. Completely abandoned her when she became depressed after her father died and started seeing another woman behind her back. When he was with my step mom, after she found out he was cheating on her, he went to live with his new girlfriend and left me to live with my step mom who blamed me for her failed relationship with my dad. He never says thank you for dinner and never helps clean up. Sometimes he’ll just leave his dishes and food for someone else to deal with. I honestly feel like he uses his current girlfriend as a maid, which breaks my heart because she is so sweet. 

I do not think my father is a good person. But a part of me has always hoped that he cared about me. He often forgets my birthday, never asks me how my day goes, always changes the topic when I talk about myself. It really makes me feel like he hates me.

I got my prom dress in the mail and was super excited, my dad liked it and my mom didnt say a word. she would tell me to do things and we have pets and would tell me to get them and baby talk them. i did apologize and she didn't say anything, and i did forget to say i was at school today and said it later and i did text at work like normally. i know i did something wrong but its getting frustrating having to come home to animosity everyday when im trying to enjoy the last few weeks of highschool and having one parent be understanding and easy to talk too and one not is frustrating. does anyone have advice to overcome this?",1,1,1748046314.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ktyt90/how_to_overcome_this/
1ktyj8v,My experience with bad family environment emotional and physical abuse as a child ‘trying to heal by feeling heard’,Accurate_Fuel_9032,"When I was a kid, my mom used to watch disturbing and inappropriate scenes in front of me things like self harm and intimate content.
She wouldn't change the channel when those scenes came on, and sometimes she even forced me to watch. I remember being around 10 years old and seeing a scene where a girl was being grapped in prison. I couldn't sleep for days after that. I felt scared, guilty, and overwhelmed. Another scene were a prisoner unalived himself using a spoon is stuck in my head to this day. my mom didn't care. We lived in a one-room house, so I had no way to escape. 
   Even now, at 20, I still get trauma responses. For example, black and white movies give me chills because they remind me of those moments.
   What hurts even more is that she knew it was wrong. When my cousin came over, she would quickly change the channel even for normal crime scenes cause she didn’t want her sisters hearing about this. Unfortunately I’ve had an absent father when I was 2 years old they got their divorce, I don’t remember much about him cause when they were together she left me 24/7 at my grandma’s. So literally no one to seek help from. 

   At family gatherings, such as at my grandmother's house, my mother also refused to stop watching violent or disturbing shows, even when other family members requested it. I experienced panic attacks as a child because of this, often sitting and shaking with fear, without any comfort or protection.
   In addition to emotional abuse, I experienced physical abuse from her Despite begging
her to stop, and for what silly things like spilling coffee, bad grades, I hated that house from the bottom of my heart that I sat once in front of my grandma and told her how I felt about going there and that I didn’t wanna leave her house to be alone with my mom, but nobody heard me calling for help, my mom’s response to this was asking me why saying “am I letting men in my house day and night” joking about this when I was crying to not leave my grandma’s house, but then again she’s her daughter of course she’d side with her. I just wanted to share my experience to feel heard since no one heard me as a 10 year old and I hope I’ll get justice soon.

1ktxj7h,Hypocrisy within the family,Whole-Powerful,"My mom has always acted like my sister is the smartest one and to be fair, I think she is really smart. But it’s not the greatest feeling when my mom makes that so obvious. I don’t even think she realizes she’s doing it, but it still hurts. My sister is much older than me. There’s a 13-year gap so maybe that’s part of it. But I’m not some clueless little kid. I could say something that’s completely true, and my mom would brush it off or argue with me about it even when I attempt to back it up. But if my sister says the exact same thing? Suddenly it’s, “Oh, okay.” No questions asked.  
  
It’s always been like that my sister is right, automatically. But when I say the same thing, I sound “crazy.” Then something happened today my brother asked my sister something, and she didn’t know the answer and started thinking about it with him. My mom apparently knew the right answer and got mad that my sister was “talking over her.” because they were ignoring her. It turned into this huge argument. I mean according to my brother that's not the way it happened but I wasn't there I was with my niece when everyone started yelling in the kitchen.

But like I get why she was annoyed, It hurts when you know the answer but you feel like someone else is taken more seriously than you. When you feel like they're ""Little miss know it all"" but it’s wild to me because she’s done that exact same thing to me so many times and never thought twice. It’s always okay when she does it.

I’ve tried everything from talking to him, to having his WiFi/video games taken away.I honestly think he might be on the spectrum but I have no way of confirming this. 

My mom and dad seem to have given up hope on trying to motivate him and the same goes for my other brothers as they don’t want anything to do with him. 

I convinced him to go get his GED and I thought things were looking better but it feels like now he’s just using this as an excuse to not have to look for work etc. it was supposed to be quick because he was only a few credits short of graduating. 

I get frustrated and anxious thinking about his future because I feel like he’s going to end up mooching off of either myself or one of our other relatives once my mom and dad are gone. I’m at a loss on how to help him because despite all this I still love him and I want to see him succeed.

1ktue7p,Moving Abroad but have children,Samsquanch_hunter21,"So I’ve really been wanting to move out of the country (U.S.) but I have joint custody of my kids  with my ex. Kids are 5+ yo. I have them every other weekend and some days throughout the week. I love when I get to have them but every so often work has me out of town just to a different state for months at a time. (Think kind of like a military parent who’s been deployed overseas). My ex would not fight me on a custody situation and even if so that would stop me immediately from moving as it’s not worth all of that. 

So I’m wondering if I move overseas will it feel the same or will I feel more disconnected or what will they think of me doing so?
When I’m working out of state now I’ll fly back even if only for a few days just to see them. The expense doesn’t matter when it comes to seeing my kids. 
I try to relate to military families or even fictional characters like Ted Lasso when I think about the distance but not sure that’s the best way.

My sister's moods switch really fast or stick for months and sometimes years. Yesterday she was having a terrible day and I know she was using all her self help coping mechanism and they weren't working. She exploded and then mid explosion asked which dessert we wanted. Then exploded again. It wasn't at us. She was just venting in a note on her phone and we could see it whenever she tossed the phone to the side. Every time she gets happy she has a seizure. The last seizure I witnessed was while we were watching mmpr theme song on YouTube and she hit the floor, gasped like a flopped fish, arms up in the air reaching and not breathing. Neurology found nothing but it bums her out when we step in and keep her from watching certain things alone. I love my sister a lot. She's never been violent. Yeah she yells but what sister doesn't. She's been our tiny egg for forever and now the tiny egg needs help. I just don't know how to get her help and how to make her not feel bad about it. She isn't ruining our lives. She isn't hurting us. She's just hurting and we are scared she's going to die on us. Any advice would help. Even a small lead. Anything. She's trying. We're trying. We just can't get her to stop doing everything and sit still. Much less get her to go to a doctor. She's been locked up before (Wasn't her fault I swear I have the documents).

1ktsh1h,Stepdad,Electronic-Return704,"I (32M) raised my ex’s (27F) daughter like she was mine—now the real dad (33M, married with kids) is back and she wants to erase me

I (32M) was in a 5-year relationship with my ex, “Sara” (27F). When we met, she was already pregnant with her second child from a previous relationship with “Jason” (33M), who is now married with two other kids. Sara told me Jason would never be in the picture and begged me to step up. I did.

I signed the birth certificate and raised her daughter like she was my own from day one. I supported them emotionally, financially, and gave them a stable home.

After a few years, Sara got approved for Section 8 housing, started pulling away from me emotionally, and eventually ended the relationship. Not long after, she brought Jason back into the child’s life—despite swearing he’d never return. They’re not romantically involved, but now he’s being reintroduced and I’m being completely cut out.

Sara has 3 kids by 3 different men. Now she’s claiming she’s going to remove me from the birth certificate. But I believe it’s a bluff. Deep down, I think her goal is to put me on child support—not for the child’s sake, but to humiliate me and make me suffer for leaving.

The child has been living with my mother while I work out of state. I still love her deeply—but emotionally this is destroying me. I’m considering going to court to remove my name from the birth certificate to protect myself legally, but it’s one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever faced.

My dad’s side of the family has never liked my mom—from the beginning. When we moved countries, they texted me and my sister calling her a witch because she wouldn’t give them the keys to our house and garage. Mind you, she paid for everything in that house. It’s old and still needs work, and every time she tries to fix something, my dad gets mad because she refuses to just give it all away to his family.

They call him constantly asking to use our stuff—he always says yes. She says no, and suddenly she’s the bad guy. One of my uncles (who barely worked a day in his life) once told me I’m “exactly like my mom” and then refused to speak to me. I haven’t seen any of them in over six years. They’re not involved, they don’t help, and they still somehow manage to create tension between my parents from a distance.

Meanwhile, my mom’s side actually showed up for us. When we had nothing, they helped. Her brother is still present in our lives, calls regularly, and genuinely cares. But that gets ignored.

Lately, things have gotten worse. My dad barely talks to my mom. He’s cold, distant—like he’s someone else entirely. I can feel everything falling apart between them, and I don’t know how to react anymore. I’m tired of being stuck in the middle.

1ktikc2,Unemployed abusive father,euphoric_reverie,"Hi everyone!

I don't normally post on Reddit, but I just wanted to share my story about my family. Unfortunately this might be a long one. 

My dad lost his job soon after I was born, leaving my mom to financially support the whole family. For my entire childhood, he did nothing except surf the web, read/write about his early life, drink beer, and criticize others. He would often tell me that he quit his job so that he could devote his life to the upbringing of his children, but that isn't true. He got fired, and he was emotionally and physically abusive. He would always tell me, however, that he was a good father, and that my life was easy compared to his. 

He didn't let me brush my own teeth until I turned 11. He told me that if he let me do that, I would have cavities in all of my teeth. He would threaten me and also disable the wifi for the whole house if I didn't let him brush my teeth. It sounds stupid, but even if I did it on my own and told him, he would tell me that he would need to do it too. By the way, I had to get 4 of my teeth filled when I was 7. 

When I was little (about 2 years old), my parents had maids take care of me while they were at work. Around that time, I developed very compulsive behaviors, such as eating hair and other ones that I will not refer to. I also stopped being able to sleep at night, and even to this day, I am afraid to go to bed. I just turned 20 and I have been in college, away from home, for 2 years. I have been suspecting CSA for a while, because something is not right. I ended up asking my father about this recently, and he admitted that he had heard that some of the maids touched the kids in a very inappropriate way to get them to sleep. My parents never bothered to investigate this. 

  
When I was in grade 3, I suffered from terrible nausea. I don't know why, but around that time, a boy in school had a crush on me and I liked him back. I felt that it was so wrong because love in my family didn't mean warm hugs and kind words, it was control. The word ""love"" to me was when my dad cut my cookies in half because eating the whole thing was too many calories, and he wanted me to be healthy. And then behind my back, he would eat the whole box in one sitting. So I was terrified of this boy. I remember he tried to hold my hand once, and he would always walk back to class with me. It was actually very cute. But at the time, I thought that he might hurt me like how my dad did, so I didn't admit that I liked him. I still have my diary from that year, and the only page where I referred to my feelings was on the last one. I said that I only liked him ""a little bit."" I read through the whole thing again recently, and it just made me sad, because I was just a child. I was chubby, I couldn't do math, I wouldn't eat my veggies, and I hated playing soccer, but I just wanted to be loved like everyone else. I would only get scraps of affection from my parents, and I thought that it was normal. 

Around this time, I was unable to finish my dinner. I would ask my parents if I could leave the table, and I would go and sit in the backyard and cry. I would also cry to my parents every night and tell them that I felt so sick. They would ignore me. Then I started telling them to just let me die. That got their attention, but they did not comfort me. They are both very emotionally detached. Instead, they sent me to the doctor. The tests came back and everything was normal. So they sent me to the counsellor. The counsellor told my parents that she suspected I had gone through trauma and asked if they wanted me to be screened for it. My parents told her no, our daughter doesn't have trauma, and just left me to figure out my problems. 

Although my dad was the controlling one in the family, I was deathly afraid of my mom. I would have recurring nightmares where there were three of her standing in our living room, trying to chase me. There would also be dreams where she would be in my room, looking at me while I was sleeping, and she only had half a face. There was a mom at my elementary school who had the same haircut as her, and I was terrified of her. I would avoid her at all costs. I hated the movie Coraline and I had to cover my eyes when I watched it. 

My dad plotted my weight and height on a chart until I was 15. He did this with my younger sister too, but she would always lie to him, and he would never tell her that she was overweight. As a teenager, he would always tell me that I was overweight and that I would underperform in track and swimming because I had so much excess fat. I had a BMI of 18.0. Looking back at old photos, I was built like a stick too. I had significant body image issues and disordered eating as a result of this. I would make myself run 10km every day and I would skip breakfast and lunch. I would never lie to him about my weight and height because he told me that he was doing it because he was a loving father. But he never told me that he loved me, or that he was proud of me. 

He hit me multiple times throughout my life, and was proud to announce it at famiIy gatherings, or whenever my mom had friends over (he has very few friends). My mom stopped letting him eat dinner with her friends, because he would usually say something rude about the cooking or drink too much. 

The summer after I graduated high school and turned 18, I made more plans with my friends because I was moving to a different city for college. I stayed out late one night because I was visiting the night market. There were no boys, there was no alcohol, nothing wild at all, just me and five friends buying as much food as we could with hardly any money. I have always been a diligent student, and I received many academic awards, did well on all my AP exams, and had gotten into a top uni for physics. I had agreed with my parents that I might be back very late because it was a long commute back home. I arrived home at about 2 AM and quietly went to bed. I was texting my friend for about half an hour on my new phone. My parents didn't allow me to have a phone until I turned 18. Up until the end of high school, I had a designated screentime that was 5-6 PM every day. I had to beg for extra time if I had homework or exams to study for. 

I must've been giggling to myself, because I accidentally woke up my dad, and he came into my room. He immediately began looking for things to confiscate. He would usually take away my laptop so I couldn't do my homework. But that night, for some reason, I blurted out that he just couldn't take any of my things. He came over to me and slapped me across the face. Hard. And then he walked out. I felt that sting for a very long time, and I will never forget the look in his eyes. He didn't love me. He wanted to hurt me. 

  
Just two months prior to that, I had shown up to the dinner table in a tank top and shorts. Nothing scandalous at all - it was normal attire for a high school girl who had just come back from her afternoon run. My dad looked at me and told me that he couldn't bear to see me like that, and told me to get out of his house. So I got out. I was walking around the streets for hours until my mom let me in when he was asleep. When I went into the kitchen for a snack (I hadn't had anything to eat), I found that he had thrown away my dinner. When I was 16, I had an argument with him which resulted in him grabbing onto my arm, twisting it, and dragging me across the floor. He also broke a door in my house because I had locked myself in there due to being scared of him, and he basically just kicked it down. 

  
I have not been home for about a year. I am now living alone in the city where I go to uni. My sister was my best friend growing up, and now we have not spoken because our relationship has been strained due to my poor relationship with my father. He has never once hit her or slapped her. I still text both of my parents. I'm not sure why I still bother with my dad. I think that it is time to cut ties with him, but I guess a small part of me is still looking for approval from him. I know I'll never get it, though. 

My dad has a very detached way of speaking. He never tells people that he is happy for them, he never congratulates anyone for hard work, and derives some sort of satisfaction from tearing others down. I finished my second year of physics this year with a very strong GPA, and I was offered my second research internship as well. He told me to not get so complacent and that internships meant nothing. He said that a monkey could do what I did. He did not wish me a happy 20th birthday, and I of course was never expecting him to do so, because he forgot my 16th and also cancelled Christmas that year. I am not joking: he yelled at me on Christmas morning for waking him up (I was downstairs cooking breakfast for the whole family), and then told everyone that nobody could open presents. I've never forgotten his birthday. I have bought him birthday gifts and Christmas presents. I may be earning barely above minimum wage as a uni student who works full-time in the summer, but he has not worked for the past 20 years. 

Just the other day, I suggested to my mom that he seemed somewhat detached and rude over text, and I said that not even my manager/supervisor at work was that blunt. She ended up telling him that, which was not what I intended at all. He responded like this to me: 

>I’m going to cut back on the use of WhatsApp between us because Mom suggests you feel strongly that I am denigrating your activities. I will go back to email, which I feel suits my style better. It’s in the nature of WhatsApp that messages must be abrupt. I can’t pound out long messages with my finger, and I suppose you find direct factual messages too rude or blunt.

That message is not obviously an abusive one, but I just cannot help but feel that many people would have instead said ""Sorry I've made you feel that way"" instead of blaming the mode of communication (WhatsApp) and suggesting that it's my issue for finding ""direct factual messages"" to be rude. That's his normal way of communicating. 

To this day, I struggle a lot with socializing. I have had many close friends in my life, but I have had very few surface-level friends. I cannot make small talk for some reason, and other people tend to see me as someone they can open up to. Of course, I am more than happy that people are comfortable speaking their mind with me. I love to help my friends and make sure that they feel appreciated and listened to, because I know exactly what it's like to cry extra loudly in my room and to have nobody come up to me and ask me if I'm doing ok. But I have recently been feeling very drained because many people use me as an unpaid therapist, and sometimes I really just want to invite someone to grab a bubble tea with me. I don't really want to unpack their childhood trauma on a casual Tuesday afternoon, especially since I have been through things too. Of course, I want the best for them, and I will support them, but I've basically reached my limit. I have never been in a romantic relationship because I feel very insecure about my family background, and I still feel like that little girl that I was when that boy liked her in grade 3. I feel nauseous. I feel like I can't trust anyone.

I poured myself into my academics, my job, and my research, into helping my friends, and now I'm just the girl who's too busy to do things that make me happy. I haven't smiled in a long time. I'm very grateful that I got to leave home for uni, and I would never go back, but I'm 20. I shouldn't be this stressed out, I should be living. But I'm not. I never go to parties, I feel like I'm not good enough to date, I feel that nobody can really love me. The worst part is that I don't even care sometimes. I went years of being controlled, monitored, but not appreciated for being the messy, imperfect kid that I was. Only people at school saw it. 

I've tried therapy before without much success. I was grateful that I got to vent to someone, but I feel that I just didn't even scratch the surface of everything. 

Sorry if this post seems kind of all over the place. I wrote it all in one go, and I just sort of let everything come out. I just wanted to put it out here in case someone else has had a similar experience or can provide insight. Thanks for reading!

1ktijco,"My brother is taking advantage of everyone to maintain a lifestyle he can’t afford, and I’m done helping.",Littlewiseguy2,"My brother lives in Australia with his wife and three children under the age of 4. His wife is on a student visa, which costs about AUD 2,000 per month. He’s the only one working, and on top of the tuition, they have to cover all living expenses and take care of three small kids. It’s obviously a very difficult situation, but they chose this path themselves.

At one point, they had the option to move in with my parents in Venezuela. Despite the country’s difficult situation, my parents could have offered them a roof over their heads and food while they figured things out and got back on their feet. Instead, they insisted on staying in Australia—where they have no family, no support, and no safety net.

Unsurprisingly, they couldn't handle things alone. They practically begged my mom to move to Australia for a year to help them with the kids. She agreed and has spent the last year living there, sleeping on the couch, taking full responsibility for the children and housework. Meanwhile, my brother and his wife focus on their own activities. All this while leaving my dad alone back in Venezuela in a less-than-ideal situation.

To make things worse, they convinced my sister-in-law’s sister (who lives in Chile) to take out a loan so she could lend them money. I had to pay for my mom’s round-trip flight from Venezuela to Australia, which cost me around €3,000. And more recently, my dad sent them €5,000 to help them out.

Despite all this support, they make no sacrifices. For example, they own a large SUV they refuse to sell—even though they bought it just three days after arriving in Australia without even having jobs yet. This is just one example of the poor financial decisions they continue to make.

At this point, I feel like my brother is taking advantage of everyone to maintain a lifestyle he simply can’t afford. I’ve decided I’m done helping. I have a wife and daughter of my own, and I can’t keep draining myself for people who not only refuse to make changes but also show no gratitude.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Am I being too harsh?",3,4,1748003977.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ktijco/my_brother_is_taking_advantage_of_everyone_to/
1ktiizb,Anyone struggling with a food greedy sibling?,SunlightRoseSparkles,"
Since I can remember my sibling has been eating snacks quicker than a starving child. 
Everything in the closet runs out quick. So from a young age I learned to hide food or buy food that they dislikes. Especially because I was a picky eater and sometimes I just prefer snacks. This week, I decided to not hide everything. Expect for the food they didn’t like, I left a box of cookie. I hid a can of Pringles. (Party size.)
Now, she has her own things. We can share it. It’s for everyone. She bought a bag of chips, fruit covered in chocolate, a box of soft Oreo containing 6. We went to the grocery store on Monday. By Tuesday night they were GONE. She started asking me for Pringle’s I eventually let it out. I wasn’t even half way there. By the next morning gone! Not gone actually they left me a few broken pieces… My box of cookies were open now. I took 2. Next day, today I go to the pantry GONE. Not a cookie in sight. Like what? Can I eat peacefully? I still have hidden stuff from previous weeks. How can someone be that GREEDY. Leave some for others for crying out loud. I am at my wits end. They are older than me, but they sure aren’t showing me an example. I eat normally or I am competing to eat all before they are gone. But sometimes I just one to eat it across the week. How do you even deal with this? Our parents have money, we don’t have food insecurity. Like what? Am I missing something?

1ktha8m,I want to leave,fievrats2308,"Using a throwaway account because I don't want this linked to my main.

I am 22f from India. I live with my brother (27M), mother (49F) and father (54M). My family has always had a lot of issues. It's always felt like everything's held together by a thread that could snap at any moment.

Last month when my Grandpa died (mom's dad), my parents had a huge fight (mostly dad screwed up), and then I shifted to Grandma's place to keep her company for a bit so she doesn't spiral out by herself. 

I stayed at her place for almost 2 months before she left to stay with my uncle's family for a bit. While at her place, I had a lot of peace and quiet and no family drama or tension or tip toeing around everyone's feelings. I didn't have to worry that one wrong word would make my dad or my brother blow up. I didn't have to keep checking whether whoever I was talking to was actually listening to what I said. I didn't have to sit and listen to a constant barrage of useless unsolicited advice when I just want to vent. 

I shifted back home after Grandma left. They've always fought and stuff but, I now wake up every morning to raised voices and yelling in the kitchen between my dad, my mom and my brother. I have to deal with my parents constantly cribbing to me about what the other did or said or didn't do or didn't say. I have to worry that one word will lead to my dad or my brother blowing up. I've lost my peace. I had peace for the first time and then I lost it. I tried talking to my brother about it but he tries to play it down saying it's not as bad as I think it is.

I've tried telling my parents that I'm not their therapist or their marriage counselor and to stop treating me as such. But they don't seem to get it. They keep venting and cribbing and expect me to pick sides. To them, this is all a normal part of being a family. They don't seem to understand that they are one team, not two and that they certainly shouldn't be taking jabs at each other and trying to score one over the other. 

All of them love me and treat me like the baby of the family but honestly, it feels suffocating to keep living with them. I want to leave and move out or something but circumstances make it so that I can't leave for a while atleast. I also considered therapy, but we don't have the money for it and they wouldn't go for it nor would they let me go for therapy because they 'don't believe in stuff like that'. They think therapy is for weaklings. I want to be able to protect my peace until I reach a point where I can shift out, but I don't know how.

1ktbctt,Parents hate eachother and its ruining my life,Frequent_Exam_5501,"You dont have to read it but my life is fucked in my eyes lmfao (Yap session)

Now im (16m) going to start, Ive only liked a few, few people in my family, and my family is big. Either they are full on sketchy people, have mental disorders, or are too old to even count to ten. This goes for my parents, since they, and they only have been fucking up my life, and little brother's life.

Now I dont hate my lil bro, dont get me wrong, but since hes still young, hes gotten on my nerves but he still looks up to me and we do get along pretty good. Although my parents, dad specifically, has been taking anger out on him, for no reason (Ill get into the many reasons why my dad, has fucked up my family)

Now my dad has never been perfect, or a good influence. Although he had a shitty childhood doesnt mean he gets to fuck up mine and my lil brothers life. He has sold drugs with his cousin, stolen, (probably) drunk, never finished school, etc, while he was young, although he did have divorced (mother/stepdad religious, dad was a gambling addict), and was mostly influenced by his dad which caused him to run away from both of them at 16, meaning he never finished school. (Refuses to get GED even now, almost at 47)

He met my mother at 25 (she was 18, pretended to be 19) and they got along. A decade and a bit later, they had me (lil bro like 5 years later), and they were working shitty, nowhere-leading jobs, so they started a legal business (Im not gonna doxx myself) around 2014 so they could take care of us and WFH, since my grandparents old-age and mental-problems had been ramping up. It was a struggle and they sacraficed things, but it did make them somewhat good money (lower middle class type money) so we had a nice house, food, entertainment, all that. Come 2015, my dad was cheating..? Or texting, I dont really know but Ive seen the screenshots of it and my mom put a end to it by getting the husband of the cheating wife to stop texting my dad (my dad&mom werent married till early 2020's due to student loans might affect business and such)

After that ordeal, they went on, as normal, until near the summer of 24, I thought life was going great, I had just gotten out my sophomore year, and was relaxing, but my parents spending entirely fucked us. My dad spent over 1500$ at 3 different gas-stations/stores just for beer. BEER. Within a goddamn month which fucked us. So then hes been getting drunk, beginning to ask me for money (I wonder where my 400$ went, heh) and so, our food started to look like were living on 50$ a day, and my parents arguing got out of hand. My dad has been physically abusing my mom, although she does instigate it (There is 200% something mentally wrong with the BOTH of them) but yeah. Ill list some things of what hes done to my mom
- Pointed a gun (not sure loaded or not)
- Made her eye bleed (pretty sure he slammed her into a door
- Lighted her hair on fire with cigerate
- Brusied multiple areas on her body
- Pulled her hair
Im not gonna continue to type them but you get the point. Theres more for fucks sake too 

So my mom told his family (theyre weird, some support her, then they dont, like what? My dads mom is the religious one and my grandma is just downright dumb. Unless my dads brainwashed her, then yeah, people do have opinions though) After that theyre arguing has ramped up even more and my dad has threatened to ■■■■ himself 3+ times. Crazy. My mom got his cousin to come get him (his cousin wanted him baker acted. Baker acted. Jesus)

So now, we're living on barely any food, due to his 4 beers a day and (their) 3 packs of cigerates every 3 days (Mom smokes to not feel hungry. Like bro) although they dont smoke inside, they smoke anywhere else (you dont shit where you sleep).

Ive given up. Ive almost called the cops three times now, and I might just get CPS involved. Id rather go through a foster home rather than living on the streets with two pyschotic individuals. Im not going anywhere near anyone in my family after im 18. Its probably gonna be a nice permanent trip to Europe (Just since I wanna explore the culinary side over there) or greenland.

I recently got a job and have been gone for several hours (Thank you lord) since I dont have to be near them. Although my mom has been completely using me as a therapist and asked me the same question 5 different times each car ride home. I hate it. And I do plan to get a second job. Yes im working 4-11, Yes ill work more when I become used to waking up with a alarm clock.

Also we now have a 3 day notice or we get evicted!

Anyways if you can just answer this one question: Do I call CPS? Im not trying to risk my job/school or anything but I do not want to be here anymore with my crazy parents.

Thank you, im out. ",1,1,1747976367.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ktbctt/parents_hate_eachother_and_its_ruining_my_life/

You’re not worried about your grammar now, just talk to yourself.



I’m grateful for what I have and what I have been given. Growing up I always wanted to be part of another family because I felt there was better. However now I see all the struggles and challenges that you guys had to go through for me to be where I am today.

That just makes things worst, I feel this burden of the world on shoulders, I’m powerless, not rich, not the smartest but something still draws me sufferings around the world especially where I’m from. I still very young but would have done more to be at better place now.

I’m struggling with my relationship with God, my self, my father and others. 

The heartaches badly to give a helping hand but I do need a helping hand too. My only source of confidence and hope my Lord Jesus, I have drifted far & far away. Father please have mercy on me. Battling with the constant cycle of sin and it’s me, it’s me.  You’re a bad STORY -TELLER ! 

Everyday I fight fear of anxiety and uncertainty, but God has always a made a way for me. I DONT understand it, got into a top PhD program even without trying. Thank you God!. But to make matters worse it, im wasting this amazing opportunity 😭, God have mercy on me. Being sunk into a lone states of thoughts, addictions and other bad habits. But I won’t give up now, that’s not an option, suicide is not option. 

I just need that 1 friend, compassion, mentor that I can count on. 

I’m going to getting better communicating, working hard, going to own my farm land some day, fight the this addiction some day, have a better relationship with my father and mother, met my soulmate, change others lives, make myself proud, and most importantly a stronger bond with God. 


And whatever comes way good or bad there will be A WAY through Christ who strengthens me.



Thanks to myself for doing this 😁❤️

1kt8ulm,Brother won't help with elderly Mom Advice needed.,BeaksAndEyeballs,"**My 95-year-old mom lives with us, and we love her… but my brother is a freeloading ghost and I’m at my limit. Advice?**

So, picture this: my 95 year-old mom, sharp as a tack, reasonably mobile, living with us in our big ol’ mountain house with a view so nice it should come with a soundtrack. She’s in great shape for her age, but obviously, at 95, we worry about things like falls, so we don’t leave her alone for more than 4–5 hours. 

Now, my husband and I live in the middle of beautiful nowhere, 600 miles from civilization (aka my siblings), and there are exactly zero “Visiting Angels” or other respite care options around here. So guess who gets to be the full-time caregivers? 

Now the fun part. Our daughter is having a baby soon (YAY!), and we want to spend a month with her. A whole month. Holding a newborn. Eating takeout. Sleeping (well… kind of). You get it.

So, I asked my brother (age: 70, job status: chronically unemployed, location: civilization-adjacent) and my sister (helpful, reasonably sane) if they could split the month and stay with Mom. Sister says yes but can only do the *first* two weeks. Awesome.

Brother? Ohhh boy.

This man who has not worked in literal decades, who has been getting my mother’s $3,000/month social security check for the past **ten years**, who has contributed *zero* toward her actual care says he *can’t* because… wait for it… **“I can’t cook and take care of her for two whole weeks.”** 

But wait, there’s more! He also told me he’s about to start a *part time job* in **two months**, so he *really* can’t commit. He hasn't worked in decades yet the first time I ask for help, he is about to start working?

I’m furious. Like, *spicy enraged* levels of mad. How can someone take $3K/month from our mother for a *decade* and not be able to do two freaking weeks so I can go meet my grandchild?

How do I let this go? Or do I not let it go and torch the relationship? Because I’m *this close* to mailing him a frozen casserole with a note that says, “Here’s your cooking problem solved.”",16,38,1747967832.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt8ulm/brother_wont_help_with_elderly_mom_advice_needed/

I had friends and family tell me that I need to get a lawyer, but I don’t have the funds for a lawyer and also been told to move out of the county or state to get away from them, but I don’t have the funds to do that either and I feel like all they’re going to do is follow us we were also told do not answer the door or let them in, but I’m afraid that would just make things worse my wife and I have almost separated over children’s services because of the amount of stress we have been going through and we’ve been together for 14 years we don’t know what else to do besides doing what we’ve been doing with children’s services we love our boys more than anything and we always do anything and everything for them, but we feel like children services.

1kt7ta2,My family hate me,NoSecretsNoLies82,"Recently my mum said the abuse I sustained as a child was something I probably warranted as I never raised anything as a child and I never called the police as a child if I felt I couldn't speak to anyone at home. My sister threatened to kill my dog and they all keep taking votes about how much they hate me and they raise hands on who hates me, of course they all raise hands - it's petty and school playground rubbish. My mum pulled my hair around 5 months ago and I keep getting pushed around in every way. I need an eye operation but keep putting it off due to lack of support and I have serious trust issues so can't and don't rely on anyone. Before my dad died, he hated me too. I was badly abused as a child, beaten by family, bullied by siblings and abused by my mum's brother in the most disgusting way possible. My older sister doesn't live with us but when I called her for help she said it's because I was difficult to be with when I was growing up that I get treated like I do as an adult. I'm moving out soon but I know I'm never going to ever heal from this. I'm in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD and even though that's given me some clarity, it's also made me further feel like I am fully useless.ifbmy own family couldn't love me, I have no hope from anyone else.

1kt7p1d,Mom thinks I'm selfish for not wanting to adjust travel plans--am I in the wrong?,Top_Sink_2605,"My friends and I have been planning a 4-day trip to visit our friend in Colorado for months. We are all college students, and due to internship schedules, mid-August is the only time we can all make it work. But this trip coincides with my family's annual month-long trip to visit my grandparents in California. My family leaves for California two days after my internship ends, will stay for 3.5 weeks, and doesn't go back home to Boston until a day before my school starts up again, so this family trip is pretty much the entirety of my summer free time before I go back to school.

I told my mom about my plans to take the four day trip to Colorado while she was planning the California dates, and I thought it wouldn't be a problem, especially since I and my friends planned it before my family finalized dates for California. We live with my grandparents while we are in California, so there are not any crazy hotel costs that she'd be wasting or anything. My friends and I even rearranged the dates for Colorado to be on days that my mom said would work best. The problem is that my mom has also been trying to find days while we are out there to visit another relative in Arizona and take our usual beach trip to northern California for a couple days.

She's having trouble scheduling it all, and now she wants me to fly home a day early from my Colorado trip to make her other travel plans work. I don't really want to cut the trip short, firstly because it would mess up my friends' travel plans to commute to the airport together, and also because we already kept it to only 4 days because of my family trip. I offered to stay at my grandparents' house while my family goes on the beach trip so that I don't have to leave Colorado early, and she got mad and said that the point of the trip is to spend time as a family. She says I am selfish for not considering other people's schedules and for not wanting to spend time with my family on our family trip.

These are my high school best friends, and we have been trying to make this trip happen for four years. I feel like 4 days out of the month I'm spending with my family isn't a lot to ask for, especially for a big trip like Colorado when we are from Boston. But my mom is paying for me to go to California, and this is my last summer before I graduate, so these family trips might be numbered. I know I am super privileged to have these opportunities to travel so much, and I want to spend time with my family, but we take this trip every year. I also go to college in my hometown, and am home frequently throughout the year, so it's not like this is their only time to see me. My high school friends have never actually been able to coordinate a trip before, and I was super excited to have as much time with them as possible in a new place.

1kt7jhm,Dad moving due to job. Sister’s  fate up in the air.,-Eraqus-,"My dad is a live-in apartment manager at a large building in Los Angeles that just got bought out by another management company. He told me that his current company will most likely find him another job but he doesn’t know exactly where. It could even be out of state.

My sister (29 F) has been living with him and never had her own place. She has severe anxiety which has caused their relationship to be tumultuous at times and I am worried this is his opportunity to cut and run. She recently landed a good job and it has greatly improved her whole attitude. It definitely does not pay her enough to afford rent in this city though. He hasn’t told her about the situation out of fear of how she will react.

I (31 M) moved into my own 1 bedroom apartment a few years back and have LOVED having my own space and the solitude it brings with it. I am worried that the current situation might threaten that. I don’t make enough to move into a two bedroom with her and my current place isn’t big enough to accommodate her.

Any recommendations on how to deal with this are welcome.",1,4,1747963737.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt7jhm/dad_moving_due_to_job_sisters_fate_up_in_the_air/

1kt64a5,Anyone else grow up relating to Cinderella?,karissamallow,"I met my stepmom when I was 8. My parents custody agreement was I went with my dad Saturday 8am to 8pm. It was supposed to be 50/50 but my stepmom threw a fit to my dad that once a week was more than enough. I was actively being abused at home by my mom’s bf and told my stepmom several times. She’d use what I said as “drama”. When I saw her on the weekends with her two daughters it was rare. 

She convinced my dad to switch his custody to once a month so they could have their “Saturdays back”. Our one Saturday a month ( my brother and I) we’d just sit at his apartment all day. I found out this was bc my stepmom said he couldn’t “waste” money on us. When I did see her we’d go on an activity. My brother and I would be neglected the whole time if my dad was there. She’d refuse to buy us food but get her kids food and say they couldn’t share. Through all of this everything she did she did with a smile and she had a way of making you feel bad for even asking. 

When I was 12 I was rescued from my mom’s home by my grandma. Of course my dad’s gf threw a fit about me living with them so I lived with my grandma for years hoping one day he’d change his mind. My grandma knew the issues with my stepmom and insisted I don’t live with her. But when I was 16 I was in a LDR and I thought if I moved with my dad I could finally have freedom to speak with him and see him in person. I convinced my dad I could move in the summer after 9th grade. He agreed I could continue going to my same school and he’d drive me. When she found out she came completely unglued. Within a week of he being there she threw me out of the house a dozen times, told me to unalive myself, and I slept at the church up the street in the grass basically the whole summer. 

When school started she would rage if my dad got up to take me to school or picked me up. She said I needed to be paying for gas. Bc of this I had to take the public bus. Every week she was upset if my dad gave me bus money saying I should be working by now. Same with lunch money. She had a EBT card and even though she got tons of food every month for FREE she’d write her name on everything saying I couldn’t have it only her and her kids. My dad would buy me the breakfast sandwiches once in a blue moon but she would end up eating them all. 

She’d call me selfish,greedy, and a liar constantly. If she was upset with me she’d take the cords to the WiFi box, tv, and my flip phone. This became a regular thing and she’d keep the cords in her car unless she was home. Everyday I’d do homework at the school library for hours and come home. I’d come home to an empty house with a note saying to clean the whole house. And I’d have to. She’s come home at 11-1am and do an inspection. If one thing was out of place she’d pound down my door and pull me out of bed. 

As far as school, if I stayed home that day i wasn’t allowed to stay home, ever. She’d come in my room screaming, rip the covers off, dump a cup of cold water on me, and push me out the door throwing my backpack out on the ground. The work around for this was I’d have my bf call my school and call in so I could stay home without my parents being notified. I’d hide under my bed or leave to the public library for the day. 

When I was working I’d have to walk to and from work even-though my manager expressed to me several times I needed a ride home as I was getting off at 10pm. As far as clothes she said I was “wasting” the $20 cash I was allowed for back to school clothes (mind you I’d have to trek 2+ hrs to the nearest target and back home jus to spend it) while her children were given a $1500 allowance each for clothes. My birthdays were ignored every year and she’d convince my father to do nothing and I’d be home alone all day. I couldn’t do any sports or have friends bc she’d refuse to give me a ride. 

My senior year I was never home. Sleeping in my car, friends house, school, or work 24/7. As far as food, my two stepsisters were taken out to eat breakfast lunch and dinner seven days a week while at home I was expected to pick around the house and find whatever canned food I could eat. Things change the last year of me being there because I got my first big girl job and I started working all of the time I would work 16 hour shifts on the weekends and on school days work eight hours. When I finished high school she insisted that I should pay the market value of rent in our area and that she wanted about $2000 a month. I would like to add that in addition to everything else that was going on I was doing 4 to 6 hours of chores every single day She refused to clean or make her kids clean, insisting that I was home all the time mostly because I was never included in anything and if I was home, I should be cleaning. 

My long-distance boyfriend came to visit me during this time and things didn’t end up working out. I was devastated because he was my way out of this house. He was well over 18 had an apartment and we had plans that I was gonna move in with him once I finished high school. Because of this she started really resenting me since she wanted me out the same day of graduation. I evened up moving in with my now husbands family after explaining the situation. 

Through all of this I was a straight A child, extremely well mannered and never making trouble. She two daughters are 18 and 23 now. The older one is in and out of prison and a drug addict still living at home. The 18yr old smokes, parties, and is a dropout. I find it crazy the polar opposite we are and that I was always seen as the “bad child”. My stepmom and I have been no contact for a few months. I’m 25 now and she’s continuing to be disrespectful to not just myself by my in laws. This branched off to my now toddler and I had enough. Idk if anyone else had a stepmom like this but I’m not the only one who’s said she’s not nice I haven’t met one person who likes her and that says a lot.",2,1,1747959285.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt64a5/anyone_else_grow_up_relating_to_cinderella/

1kt5pd6,Family arguement with context,FunAdvertising4546,"Hi. 

My question is.... who is in the wrong here?

So a family member, a brother, creates a text group with 8 people in it. For context, he is the only one in the group that flew the nest and moved from England to Germany. He visits on average once every 3 years only.

He says, a summary: That he'll be visiting the home country in a month and is wondering who can make it. ""This is just to get the ball rolling and to see who is in and who is out. 3 siblings text that they look forward to it. OUR mother texts ""will gave to see if I can get off work for it... will let u know asap"" Then another brother (one visiting brother insulted a few years back with something personal... and they've been a bit funny since,  kind of... but okay, no major arguements yet about it)texts ""I'll leave it, thank.""

Visiting brother gets annoyed by his text and immediately removes himm from the group after he PMs him, 
""okay..........take a breath"" they have a quite arguement in PMs. MAINLY ABOUT THE REPLY TEXT IN GROUP CHAT. Then visiting brother screenshot their messages and shares them to our family group chat, another one set up ages ago... seperate to the new group chat he set up about the visit. Visiting brother pleads with rest of family to ""talk"" to him, very much playing victim, almost funnily so, I think. They then have a fight here. They haven't spoken since.  It's been 3 years. 

Who do you think is most wrong here?  Should anybody apologise? There's more to this story than just the text message? They had beef in the past. And all is brothers usually pull the piss out of each other... so is weird how the group chat turned into this.
Is stressful for the entire family. ",1,1,1747958054.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt5pd6/family_arguement_with_context/
1kt4phc,Family didn’t come to my graduation for my masters,LittleCrouton707,"So, I graduated with my masters 2 weeks ago. My immediate family like mom, dad & brother came and then others like my aunts, cousins, and grandma showed up. It was great! We went kayaking the day before graduation & it was so fun! My cousin who is 29 cried during it because she was frustrated, but she got to the end and felt better lol. Anyway, my brother texts the family group chat to tell everyone to meet him and my dad the next morning at 7:30 AM so that they can all go together. My mom and I had to go earlier so I could get situated for the ceremony. However, in the morning my aunt (mother of the crying cousin), crying cousins sister & her two kids & the crier said that they would just meet the family at the stadium. This was odd, but whatever I had to focus on myself getting there. Fast forward to me walking out for the ceremony with my classmates and I see my mom, grandma, brother, etc. and I wave at them. But there are multiple seats surrounding them that are empty. No crying cousins sister & her family to be seen. Fast forward again to me walking out after the ceremony and I wave to mom again, AND THE SEATS ARE STILL EMPTY. I look up and see aunt of crying cousin with her grandson and I wave. It’s odd because they are up in the balcony area away from our other family members, but hey, thanks for making it. 
We are now outside and I find my family and we take pics and I ask “Where’s (crying cousin’s real name)?” My brother looks kind of uncomfortable and was like “Well, they didn’t make it. We don’t know where they are.” Aunt of crying cousin has disappeared as well. That side of the family is nowhere to be found and pictures are taken without them. Super weird. Anyway, it’s 11 PM and catering gets to the house for the party at 2:00 PM. My mom, friend and I go get coffee and something light to eat and hang out at the Airbnb to get situated for the party. 2 PM comes and so does the catering. We start to get plates to eat when suddenly the door opens and crying cousin, other cousin & her children, & auntie come through the door. Crying cousin runs up to me and hugs me and says “CONGRATULATIONS!!!” And I say “Thank you” but feel odd. They carry on about their business and do not say a word about missing my graduation. Not a single word. The party carries on and not a word. I try to hang out with my friend to get away but crying cousin keeps butting in and being domineering of the conversation. It’s now 5 pm and we all need to leave for the concert we’re going to at 7: 30 PM. As my friend and I are driving along I am becoming PISSED OFF. Slowly second by second I am more angry. We get to the concert and my mom has the tickets and is scanning everyone in at the gate when crying cousin shows me her new hat with my university on it and says “Do you like my hat?!” And apparently I made a face because she asks “You don’t like it?” And I turned to her and said “A hat from the university’s graduation that you didn’t go to?” She….FLIPPED. She suddenly starts to scream at me WE COULDN’T FIND PARKING!! WE HAD NO CHOICE!!! Her arms are open wide as she is screaming at me and I see my poor brother who is peaking on shrooms disperse with the rest of my family from the situation. My mom suddenly jumps in and screams GET IN!! EVERYBODY GO! And crying cousin lives up to her name and cries with her arms crossed and walks into the concert venue and up the hill away from all of us with her niece and nephew who are 19 & 21 comforting her. I then had a great time at the concert lol.
Any way, long story short crying cousin ignored me the rest of the trip and laughed too hard when jokes at my expense came up. The other family members apologized, but before they left I went & addressed the crier about what happened and guess what? SHE CRIED. She said they had no choice, I asked why didn’t you get out of the car and let your sister find parking, she said “I’m not just going to leave my sister.” Apparently I was an idiot to even suggest that. &&& they also went to Longhorn steak house after my graduation that they missed. “But they only got salads.”
Sooooo….there’s more to the story but yeah. I mean I feel completely disrespected. I felt like I wasn’t even allowed to be upset. They truly feel like they did nothing wrong and if I bring it up they flip. I just feel hurt that I worked so hard for that masters and they just put such little effort into that one moment. They even took from it. I don’t understand & the disrespect and lack of empathy is crazy. I just feel like I don’t truly matter to some of my family.",10,3,1747955179.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt4phc/family_didnt_come_to_my_graduation_for_my_masters/
1kt4lba,Older parents and finances (quite lengthy),GlitterMe,"My Mom and stepdad always seem to be struggling financially. They're in their 70s and this isn't a new situation. They own their home, they have food and pay the bills etc, but they're almost always tight for money. I'm beginning to think it's simply that my stepdad is a poor money manager. For example, several years ago my stepdad was going to do a reverse mortgage; my husband is a real estate professional and talked him into refinancing instead. That worked out well for them, they paid off some debt and were able to buy a new, reliable vehicle (which was paid off recently). But, now they're struggling again. This same scenario happened when his mother passed away and he received an inheritance. They caught up on things, splurged at Christmas....and then were eventually deep back in the hole again. Wash rinse repeat.

Last Friday my mom messaged me that they need $500 by August to make their 6 month car insurance premium payment. She said they needed to try and sell a spare vehicle, but being that neither are on social media they didn't know how to go about it. Well of course I said I'd list it, so I did and it sold very quickly. Yay! 

But...The next morning I received a message from her saying the purchaser wanted to return the vehicle bc he couldn't even get it home. I'd put in the ad there were issues and presumably it was discussed by the buyer and my stepdad, but it went south and yes the vehicle was returned and so of course was the money.

I suggested to my mother that they park the vehicle in their driveway and remove the insurance from it (I don't think it has to be insured if it's being stored and not driven). Then I said how about make the insurance payments on a monthly basis so you don't have to come up with 500 right now. No response. In fact, she has not messaged me at all since that day, when typically she does at least a few times a day. I know she wasn't feeling well, but I think too that that is related to the stress and anxiety, etc. She gets very much in her own head, which I get because I am also high anxiety and worry a lot. 

I found out at the same time that she brought up the car insurance payment that they paid their yearly house insurance premium with their tax refund, meaning that they have neither the property taxes or house insurance included in their house payment, which I thought they had done when they refinanced. ""We've always paid them separately"". Yeah, and it's always a struggle for you!! That just boggled my mind, that they had not arranged that with the refi.

She has not straight out asked me for money, and I don't know that she will, but I feel the weight of the unspoken request and it's stressful. I finally reached out to my sister because I was so frustrated, and she said she'd pay it for them - I said maybe we could at least just split it. So it'll get taken care of, but nothing will change. It's been like this for 30+ years. 

I'm not trying to be judgey, I'm just so frustrated. My husband and I have been in the hole badly before, and I had to declare bankruptcy 15 years ago (just me, not him). We have tried really really hard since then to be good and responsible. We refinanced when rates were low in 2020 and paid off our own debt that had us stretched thin, and have worked very hard to not allow it to run back up. Thankfully he was super busy during Covid and made a lot of money that we banked and we're trying to prepare for our own retirement down the line. It's not easy at all, and I get that. My mom and stepdad do have a tight budget because he was kind of forced to retire earlier than he otherwise might have, and so now draws his pension from that job, and my mom gets Social Security. I'm not sure if he also gets SS. So I know it's tight for them. But it's the history of repeated poor choices that frustrate me so badly. 

At what point do you say to your parents - look, you need help with managing your money, because we can't keep bailing you out, or feeling like we have to because we're watching you struggle? There's no real reason as far as dementia or anything like that, and I know they would fight us about it and flat our refuse. When my mom was a single parent she paid the bills and took care of finances. Now my stepdad does it all and my mother is like a child who simply receives an allowance and has no clue about their actual financial status. It's just irritating me.

1kt427d,Am I being dramatic about feeling pushed out of the family?,sweet_sidney,"I have been super close with my family my whole life. Especially my mom and little sibling. My little sibling as been my best friend since we're close in age and we've just always been bonded. When we'd go out people were call us the duo. They know everything about me, they've gotten me through so much and vise versa. I moved out of my house about a year and half ago. I moved 1,000 miles away to be with my long term partner. It was a really hard decision but my sibling and I had a lot of really healthy conversations about it to make sure we'd both be okay. I try to visit my family twice a year. I've been lucky to visit them three times already thanks to a bonus trip. Up until recently my sibling and I have been doing really good, we have weekly calls to catch up, we text everyday, we are always sending each other tiktoks. Things started to shift when they started to go into the dating scene. They started flirting with a ton of people and even got into a really unhealthy relationship that only lasted a little bit. I tried to have a conversation with them about how I was worried they were being reckless and maybe having some unhealthy habits. They seemed really understanding and the conversation went great. Suddenly though they stopped putting as much effort into talking with me. They stopped reposting things on tiktoks about sisterhood, they stopped telling me about people they're dating, it's a fight to get them to call me, when they do call they won't tell me anything about their life even if I try asking questions. I've been trying to plan a trip for them to come visit me because I've lived here for a year and a half my family had never visited me, suddenly they aren't sure they want to come down. 

The thing that really pushed me over the edge was they recently reposted a TikTok about their new best friend. It was about how their future kids will know her as the ""cool fun aunt"" even though they're not related. This kinda stung because we had an on going joke we were the cool fun aunts for our current niece and we were a duo who would get her into trouble by giving her too much candy. So for my sibling to suddenly be distant to me and to repost that about someone else kinda just broke me. When I brought it to them trying to explain how it hurt they started acting as if I was dramatic and toxic for being ""jealous"" of their friend. I tried to tell them I wasn't jealous and I was really happy they found a new friend to be with while I'm away that it just stung but they continued to call me dramatic. My mom did the same thing. She even guilt tripped me by saying I should be happy they have a new friend since I decided to leave them and how they struggled without me. I once again tried to explain it has nothing to do with the friend but rather the little efforts they are all putting in to see me or talk to me. 

Now I feel like maybe I'm being dramatic and if I should just drop it. I don't know why but them reposting that aunt tiktok really felt like a knife in my back. I watched it and laughed, I even liked it before realizing it said ""even though we're not related"" and it wasn't about me. 

TLDR: My sibling and I were super close. They suddenly started to put less effort into talking with me or trying to see me after I had a discussion on them being unhealthy in relationships. They then went on to repost a TikTok that was an inside joke for us but about their friend. They started to call me dramatic and jealous alongside my mom for being upset about them not making efforts to talk to me or visit me ",1,1,1747953347.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt427d/am_i_being_dramatic_about_feeling_pushed_out_of/

1kt3amy,I have a question,FunkyBoiStreamer,"I wonder what people think on this
So my sister is 3 years younger than me and we share a bathroom there are 3 bathrooms 1 for me and my sister 1 for my mom(it's disgusting) and the 3rd is my dads
My sister love to take 20 minute makeup sessions in me and her bathroom for no reason she has a room with a mirror and a light there is a mirror in the hallway and there is another bathroom nearby

1kt2xun,Little sister,OverallRequirement34,"Hello 

What can I do or say or tell my little sister who is 14 years old and just started dating?  I know I can’t control anyone or anything, but I just want her to be good and safe and not get pregnant young and and be focused on herself and her school. For context, we are part of the Latino community and I feel like our community kinda just glosses over teen pregnancy, and all that. I know she’s getting older and she’s gonna wanna start dating and getting to know people, but I dont want her to be focused on boys at all to be honest. I know its ‘ok’ to get experience, but if im being honest, she deserves to get an education, career, and make something for herself. Of course the boys let them date and even do whatever they want, because theyre guys and lets be honest we live in a world where they brush shit over for guys. But I just want my sister to live a better life than me.",1,5,1747950378.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt2xun/little_sister/
1kt2w6w,AITAH,One-Improvement5058,"So, my mom told me that she and some of my other relatives are traveling to Arizona May 20th for our family members wedding. This relative is my grandfather’s brother’s daughter.  I don’t know them.  We may have met before but I don’t currently know them.  This got me thinking what’s going to happen when my 1st cousins get married.  I have no relationship with any of my cousins or aunts and uncles.  We don’t really talk and mind you I have (20 something family members).  Most of them I haven’t spoken to since October of 2024 because we were at a family members memorial.  No call, texts, emails, nothing.  I don’t talk to them because I don’t care too talk to them.  We never got close growing up and I don’t live near them or have their phone numbers so we have no contact.  But when they do get married I won’t call or text them because I think it’s so fake to reach out to people I don’t talk to.  When I graduated High School, I heard crickets from them.  Except for three or four family members. When I went into college, I heard crickets.  I wrestled for three years in high school.  Didn’t attend a tournament ever.  Never even seen me wrestle.  (Honestly, I didn’t want them there anyway but they could’ve came if they wanted to).  

I say this to say that I feel bad for wanting to miss out on future events but then I remember that we don’t talk or have any real relationship.  ",2,1,1747950262.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kt2w6w/aitah/

She had a daughter before we met. During the time we were together, her baby daddy was MIA for about 2 yrs. Fast forward, had a baby with mom but now we're no longer together. The daughter is promoting from 8th grade tonite. I feel I'm inclined to go. She initially wanted me to go to the breakfast as her ""dad"" but with all the issues that have been going on, she's changed her mind. But she is still asking i go see her receive her ""diploma"" and hear her speech during the ceremony. The kicker is, my actual daughter has an orchestra concert tonite. Granted, it's not the final one or a big presentation but i know she'll be upset if i don't show up. I feel that going to the ""step daughter's"" ceremony will prove better in the long run (her mom can't accuse me of certain things). Parent politics so to say.

Her dad doesn’t work and gets money from the government by filing for disability. So he mostly relies on the government and his brothers and sisters for money and occasionally would ask my gf for money whenever she got any sort of money, whether it was from the school or given to her on special occasions like her birthday, graduation, etc. She recently got fafsa money a couple weeks ago, which was around 2000$ and as of today her dad somehow got access to her card and took out 100 for “grocery money” and still wants her to give him 600 to pay insurance. She was willing to pay for things involving her car, but he still wants more. Mind she’s unemployed and focusing on school right now, which is something her dad agreed with her on as well. This obviously upset her as she uses the money for gas to get to school and what not and was saving it for upcoming events. She told her dad about how it wasn’t fair and went off to talk to his sister about it and got the brilliant idea to take away her car from her, as it’s in his name.

I feel like she is starved of emotional intimacy, and she is using me to try to get that.

These friends share vulnerable details about their life with HER, but she doesn't share her's with them... and so she uses me as her venting person to be vulnerable with.

1ksz24a,Parents VS my personal life help,Holiday-Card-9077,"
Hi, ok please listen and just give me your honest advice. Thank you.

I am a mess right now. I feel sad and confused, and my head hurts so badly.

I’m 22, and I just graduated college literally the other day with honors. I’ve already started a new job — it's in my field, and for my age, it pays relatively well. I’ve fully moved out and now live in another city, still in the same state, but finally on my own.

I can drive, I’m fluent in three languages, I’m independent, clean, responsible — I’ve done everything “right.” I feel like I’ve been the perfect daughter, especially in the eyes of my very traditional immigrant parents.

A year ago, they made me break up with my boyfriend of four years. We were in love. Still are. The reason they never accepted him? He’s half a different ethnicity. That’s it. They spent years trying to pull us apart. Around this time last year, they finally succeeded. They invaded my privacy, broke into my laptop, and read through private (consensual and safe) messages between me and him — intimate, yes, but entirely ours and not shameful. They showed these to my grandmother and used it all as ammunition. They cornered me and emotionally blackmailed me into breaking up with him.

They even said their marriage would fall apart because of me if I didn’t end it. I ended up in the hospital with a breakdown. They made it seem like he never existed. They erased that part of my life and expected me to go along with it. And for a while, I did — out of fear, confusion, and survival. But I’ve been broken since.

Here’s the truth: My boyfriend and I are still in contact. Secretly, yes — because I don’t know what else to do. We still love each other and want to be together.

I’ve tried to talk to my parents again recently, hoping for some understanding. My dad told me no daughter of his should ever be spoken to the way those messages “sounded” — even though again, they were private, consensual, loving messages. He told me the damage is already done. That I should go on Christian Mingle. My dad even told me what his idea of normal sex is and it made me uncomfortable and I felt upset. That he can hack into anything — and he’s proven that before. That after everything they’ve done for me, I’m abandoning them.

And I don’t know what to do with all this. I feel like I live two lives: one where I’m free, building a career, standing on my own feet — and another, haunted by shame and fear and control from people who say they love me more than anything.

They tell me they’d take a bullet for me. They tell me I’m beautiful and must be protected. They say they did all this — picking my college, my major, rushing me to graduate early, doing my homework, impersonating me to professors — all out of love. They say I won’t survive without them.

But when I’m alone, I feel sane. I feel me. I feel strong and clear about what I want and who I am. It’s only when I go back, even briefly, that I lose all that. I start doubting myself again. I feel like a child again.

I’m scared of their reactions too or what they will do.

They tell me I’m cherry-picking problems. But I’m not hiding anything. I’m not omitting anything. I’m not exaggerating.

I don’t want to live in secret anymore. I want to choose my life. I want to choose love. I want to be happy — unapologetically. But I also want peace. I’m scared of losing my family, but I’m also scared of losing myself.

Am I being dramatic? Crazy?

Please tell me honestly. What do I do?

1ksyofj,Hard decisions,spicericeb,"Long story short, my college graduation is coming up in a couple days and I have sent out formal invites to my family members. My mom calls me and says I am starting problems between us and one of my cousins. For backstory, this cousin is my second cousin and she excludes me from events when she hosts them. I’ve voiced (politely) that this hurts my feelings but no one seems to care so I did not invite her to my graduation or the party the following week. I felt like that was fair but now my mom is begging me to invite her just to keep the peace. I probably will end up just inviting her because I don’t want my mom to be put in a hard position but I really don’t want her there. Also, the cousin in question called me today crying and I felt really bad but ugh I’m so conflicted. 

How should I move forward? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

1kswxly,a love only sisters understand,DistrictWild6243,"How strange it is that sisters share the same life, yet each of us is shaped so differently. It's as if we hatched in the same nest, but in different shells. Fed together, loved by the same parents, facing the same worries and trials. And yet, it's as if we were never meant for each other – eventually flying out of the nest in different directions, building lives of our own and never returning to the same place again. And if we do, then as different people — shaped by experiences and healed wounds that were lived through without a sister by our side. 

How is it possible that one moment we curse them, and the next we know they're the only ones who remember every embarrassing moment, who’ve seen us in our worst and most vulnerable states? And still, they can bluntly say, “Get out of here,” and we wouldn’t take offense. We know that even if they act indifferent, they would die for us, give us a kidney – or at the very least, make us a cup of herbal tea in the evening. Sisterhood is beautiful, but fragile. 

One moment we whisper secrets, reveal the darkest corners of our souls, braid each other’s hair, and color coloring books on patio. And the next, we don’t even want to open our mouths because we sense the mood isn’t right, and any confrontation might distance us for who knows how long. It’s funny to pretend to argue, to share inside jokes, and watch our parents worry, thinking we’re being mean to each other – but we know. We know those aren’t just words, but phrases with a life of their own. And our love – unspoken, never shown (because come on, we won’t embarrass ourselves like that) – it will stay with us, even when we no longer live under the same roof. Even when we no longer spend quiet evenings together with a cup of bedtime tea, a bowl of popcorn, and a cheesy romantic movie. 

The love between sisters is something you simply can’t define. How do you explain to someone who doesn’t have a sister that, “I won’t even talk to you on the car ride, but tomorrow I’ll ask to borrow that piece of clothing I like – and even though you'll complain, you’ll still lend it to me every single time.”

After on and off sleuthing over the last year or so I’m pretty sure I’ve found them. I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to reach out to them or not so I’m looking for advice.. I would reach out to him for a chat but he doesn’t exist online really..

Is reaching out to these half siblings something that would cause more harm than good? I have no clue if they have any idea about my existence either.

 I have no motives for reaching out to anyone other than trying to learn more about myself and him… I’m not even angry at my Father or anything and not trying to stir thing up. I’m fairly certain he’s not with either of their mothers anymore.

The whole situation makes my feel really strange and anxious. 

If anyone can give me their thoughts or experience with something like this I’d love to hear it.

1ksrt7p,I hate my parents!,coolishblu,"My thoughts are a little all over the place as I write this... So apologies in advance. Really could use some thoughts and opinions.

I'm 41m, married and have kids. We are from a culture where it's normal for children to live with their parents. My parents live with me. I'll explain this later. I have had a challenging life mostly because of my father's poor decisions and choices. My mom had to pick up the slack. Growing up she was my greatest supporter but after I got married, as I started making my own decisions I saw cracks in that perfect mother-son relationship. With age and lots of therapy I realized how much of a narcissist my mom and had literally bent me to her will. My dad I believe is on the spectrum (never diagnosed) but having more insight into it, Ive come to see how that could have been the root cause to a lot of his mistakes. Doesn't absolve him from the fact that he uses his family to his gain. He's extremely selfish and all he cares about is money. I have worked since I was 20 and essentially built everything we have today. My parents fwiw basically had no savings and debt which I had to rebuild. I have been blessed with a lot of drive so I have grown and we are going quite well. 

My parents living with us was something I liked, having them close - kids having grandparents. We don't have a lot of family - I'm an only son. So I persisted in making this joint family thing work. My mom's biggest weapon is saying she wants to leave and go to her ancestral home (which again I saved from being foreclosed) knowing well it completely disrupts my plans because yes she does help around the house. She also had major health issues and she's not exactly physically able to live without help.

My Dad is similar, he uses this I'm leaving thing as a weapon. In a way, I feel used and even as I say it. I feel guilty. Like I'm not supposed to say that about them. They constantly fight, dredge up the past, I'm sucked into arguments and then it just gets into shouting matches. I've had a lot of therapy, take meds for anxiety and depression. 

Should I just cut ties? Part of me also want to hurt them.... My mind is a mess! I'm doing my best to not get my kids sucked into this. I have this fear that I won't be able to manage life without their help. My wife and I are great, but we have no friends. Never been good at that. My wife is also estranged from her parents because her mom was extremely abusive (physical) and there's a part of us where we think ""are we the problem?""

I know that's a lot but thanks for letting me vent. Any response would help.",4,6,1747923336.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ksrt7p/i_hate_my_parents/

1ksogfg,Should I forgive my Father?,Dinglebork_,"So, this story is all kinds of messed up, so I’ll try to shorten it for you all. My father is a drug addict. He has almost died once, because of his gut health issues so I have started to feel guilt about not seeing him for almost 8 years now. I stopped going around him after his multiple surgeries, and my mother leaving him for the second time. I feel so much guilt over it but he wouldn’t listen to the doctors and continued getting worse and worse, even after almost dying. I couldn’t be around him anymore, so I stopped talking to him. I regret it because I missed out on having a dad. I missed all of my birthday with him and my extended family, as all contact was cut off from them too. I was 14 when I decided to stop seeing him. It genuinely caused me trauma even looking at him. My mom and him would get into it every time I went for a visit o his house, so his house was known as the ‘unsafe’ zone for me. I was glad when I didn’t have to be there anymore. Then years flew by. I started getting texts from him. And calls, him trying to come by my work. He hasn’t stopped trying to text me or ask about my day. It makes me feel like a horrible person, but I just didn’t want to feel anymore pain as a kid. I didn’t want my parents arguing anymore, so I had to cut one of them out of my life. I feel so bad about it, that it eats me alive. He wasn’t even a good dad. Couldn’t keep a job, didn’t pay child support, didn’t feed us well. He would tell me to go entertain myself, out of the two days he got to see me, biweekly. He didn’t care about me until I decided to force him out of my life. He used to hit me as a child too, but never got caught because they taught me how to lie to CPS. (Which I ended up doing once) When I was 18, I invited him to my graduation in a last ditch effort to fix our relationship, and he didn’t come. He knew it would be the best time to see me, but didn’t come. I was devastated. He didn’t even tell my aunt I sent her an invite, so she didn’t come either. My grandparents (his father and mother), who lived out of town came but not my own dad. After that, life went by like a blur and I still feel guilt about it. I want to see him so bad, but he lives a rough life and don’t know if I want to open a can of worms. I still love him. He’s my dad. But he’s not a good guy in any way.

1ksog4k,Rant - I want to abandon my family,huvanity,"Im trying to escape this stay at home daughter pit I've ended up in. 

A little context, im 27 a middle child but eldest daughter, and carry a lot of the home-based labour of the family. My parents have a hoarding issue and are workaholics so any issues at home were too exhausting for them and they have always scrapped by with what I've always considered less than the bare minimum of what I consider liveable for a home. And this bare minimum effort also extended into their inability to care for my elderly (nearing 100yo grandfather) 
I moved into a rental property my parents own as i couldnt live with them without arguing and upsetting them by decluttering. However this rental property was pretty much abandoned for the last 15 years with very little to no maintenance and so ive been fixing it up, along side caring for my grandfather. 

After graduating from university in the middle of covid chaos I struggled to find a job and even the minimum wage hospitality jobs I had i struggled to keep as my family demanded so much time, needing me to get home to feed my grandad or take him to appointments as everyone else was busy with things that took more priority. My parents solution was to pay me my monthly wage to look after my grandad and fix up the property. About £1000 a month and this is dependent on my parents mood month to month and i often have to remind them. This mostly goes towards groceries, car payments and fixing up the house. 

This might sound like a lush set up as my days are quite flexible but as you can imagine I have very little real world experience and very little of a social circle as I spend a majority of my time with an old man, cooking and cleaning or I'm 'renovating' at home. Not to mention the countless romantic failures as im 'dependant' and 'unambitious'. But this has mainly left me with a now multiple year gap in actual employment and so getting an actual job just gets increasingly difficult, going back to education would be near impossible as i lack any recent or relevant achievements. Im just stuck.

Lately my father's started to also decline with age and I'm scared i will be stuck caring for him as well. I want out and i want out so badly. I want to move aboard and never look back. I want out and I don't even know how, I have so much responsibility on my shoulders and such guilt about wanting to abandon them all. Me leaving will without a doubt lead to such a tragic drop in quality of life for my grandad and stress for my parents but this isn't how I thought I would be spending my twenties, this isn't how I want to spend my twenties. I feel like such a failure and I'm so stuck.

1kso3r6,What is considered clean to a woman’s standard?,imanartist__,"Just to brief everyone today and a few other days, I made a few mistakes and my mom got upset. She’s not wrong for getting upset, that was never the problem. It’s just no matter what happens she always jumps on my neck about being dirty (And the argument wasnt even near that subject but she always brings it up) Now to be honest I had a few years where I guess i missed a few lessons in girl talk. She never really taught me what she wanted in a daughter. 

When I was younger I didn’t shower much, ( almost every child has done that atleast once) and as i grew older i grew out of it. But even then when i was in my tomboy phase and wanted to do everything boys did it was never changed, especially if im being shunned for not being girly enough. 

I clean fruits, i clean the kitchen, the dishes, bathroom, my room and sometimes help my older brother by cleaning his kitchen. 

I have since learned (through youtube university) how clean myself correctly and be a cleaner person. 

As Im growing older, I see more and more that nothing makes my mom happy, even if i was the cleanest person in the house, (i do most of the chores) that it’s never enough. I feel like im free loading, never doing enough to pull my weight, i throw everything off. 

And I wonder how dirty I really am if I can cook her food, bring her ice and share my snacks, with my BARE DIRTY HANDS??? And she nitpicks at little habits, and I break those habits. Not enough. 

She calls me dirty, never tells me specifically what it is that’s dirty. I try to shower twice a day, clean my room as often as possible and not let my laundry build up.

1ksnztr,Opinions on what I should do,Pleasant_Heron7843,"So too cut a long story short me and my partner have split up, her choice, she told me to leave,  now in the middle of this break up are 2 kids (not biologically mine) but for the last 3 years treated them as my own, (real dad has nothing to do with them)

The mother wants nothing to do with me, won't even have a civilised conversation, but she still wants me in her kids lives??

What would you do? She's made it clear there's no chance we will ever get back together ( personally I think there's someone else but she says there isn't)
Should I stay in the kids lives until the new step daddy comes along? Or walk away completely?

The kids are 6 & 11 the 6 year old boy literally loves me, he's always been all me, where as the 11 yr old girl has always favoured her mum, I have no kids of my own but dont want to be 6 months down the line still playing part time dad, for someone else to move in and take my place leaving me as no longer required ",4,8,1747912184.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ksnztr/opinions_on_what_i_should_do/

1kslnd6,Cousin won’t stop posting about politics in our family chat,spacegenerator,"Lately my cousin has been very vocal in our family WhatsApp chat about Trump and the economy. Our politics  generally align, but I think it’s poor taste to be posting all this stuff when nobody is asking for it and there are quite a few elderly people who won’t be around much longer and just want life updates from the younger generations. 

I think it’s especially annoying that her dad (my uncle) is pretty wealthy and has supported her into adulthood, yet she has made multiple comments (by way of memes) that complain about how millennials are all screwed and broke and can’t afford anything. She’s smart, has a college degree and parental support and could easily make more money if she was motivated to. But I know for a fact she spends lots of time playing video games or pursuing other random hobbies and hasn’t had a real job in months. 
 
I know my uncle has spoken to her about it, but she still does it. I left the chat for a few months but felt like I was missing out on what everyone was up to. It made my grandparents sad too. Part of me wants to call her out in front of everyone but she also has a victim complex and I know will make a big scene.

Should I do it anyway? Or try speaking to her privately? I know other family members are bothered by it too. 

TL;DR entitled cousin is posting unprovoked political memes/articles in the family chat and it’s killing the vibe. ",0,5,1747902664.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kslnd6/cousin_wont_stop_posting_about_politics_in_our/
1ksj5dg,Is it ok to not like my sister? Or possibly hate her,OkCaterpillerr,"I’m 19, and I hate my older sister, she’s 5 years older than me. I don’t know if hate is the word but I definitely don’t like her. Every time she speaks it’s like nails on a chalkboard. I instantly get annoyed and want to tell her to shut up. Even if it’s a harmless thing. Like her wanting to talk to me about something. She often complains about her being fat and ugly. That she will never find love. Always trying to find a way to belittle herself. 
Before I used to try to form a meaningful relationship with her because she is my sister. Growing up we didn’t have the best relationship, I was her little sister who never took a shower left her toys, drawings, and clothes on the floor. Like sisters she would beat me up typical choking kicking and just dragging me by the hair and yell at me for being messy. She would also tear up my drawings. I laugh about it now because heheh haha genuinely because it was so silly I was a lazy fuck ass kid. She would be the one with the knife in her hand trying to stab me. Because I would yell at her back. Literally I’m not joking. It’s funny lol. I would be running away. My parents by that point would intervene. Ok I was weak as fuck lmao no muscles in my body

Then we got older she went into high school, she was in her own world then she didn’t really want to talk to me or anything. Which I was ok with. I knew she had anger issues because she would ask me to do something with her I’d say no thank you and then she’d scream yell and sometimes go back to beating me up because I didn’t want to hangout with her or watch a movie. One time it was because of a movie, I told her no then she proceeded to choke me until I turned purple, I was skinnier and smaller shorter, I had no chance I never really fought back to her other than yelling back. That mad her even more mad. when she started shit I’d say shit back and that’s why it would lead to choking and kicking. I was like 10-12 around this time. And she was 15-17.

She’s the type of person to be so insecure about themselves it’s all they can talk about that’s why I didn’t want to be around her. She is still like that to this day. She no longer hits me or anything we are grown. It has stopped. Every so often we get into fights but recently it has been happening more because I’m done with her shit. I could be making dinner and then she’s like “I feel like you think you’re better than me” or even just say “ you think you’re better than me huh?”. My whole life every time we got into fights. I’d have to say sorry. Or be the one to understand her and her needs and her wants. Like ok I’m the one who she beat up, and then my parents would say “she’s a different kind of person”

Whenever I would confide in her she’d run her mouth on about all my secrets to our parents her coworkers and friends. Everyone, every time I’d say something playfully or if I hang around her say things about myself she would use it as ammunition to hurt me. Like in fights, or whenever we hangout she buys us food. And then she would be like well I bought you xyz. You should be nice to me.

I don’t know I just don’t want to be around her. Is it ok not to like her or even hate her? Or just not want to be in the same room.
Btw we still live together in the same house. 

Edit: as I’m reading this the more absurd I realize the question is, but I’ve been told my whole life that family will be by your side no matter what and care for you like no one ever will. Which I wholeheartedly agree and believe. I do intend on having a relationship with my sister in the future, but right now she is behaving it is not someone I want to be around. I’ve communicated that to her and alll she does is say she’s trying to get better and I kind of believe her. But it is not enough better to be honest. I understand she has mental health issues. But I don’t want to be around her because she is simply a terror to be around.",1,2,1747892141.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ksj5dg/is_it_ok_to_not_like_my_sister_or_possibly_hate/

1ksijdu,Gifted my frugal dad and is afraid he won’t like it,Apprehensive_City289,"I bought a well reviewed $200 reverse osmosis under sink water filter system for my dad off Amazon and I’m afraid he won’t like it. Actually I know he doesn’t like it because I know him so well. But I wanted to give to my parents something that can prolong their lives and well-being rather than extravagant things which I cannot even afford. I know they would appreciate a Tesla a lot more and I do plan on buying him one but that’s assuming I’ll become rich in the future.

My dad has always been a miser despite being a 20 million dollar man. He made me live in a moldy rat infested 40 year old trailer in the middle of nowhere with him because the rent was only $300 while he was making bank off his businesses.

He still uses a brita water filter for years and I don’t live with him anymore but I decided I wanted to surprise him with a RO filter system. I called him after he got it and he didn’t sound too happy. And I knew exactly why because I know him so damn well. RO wastes more water and can cause leaks. Heck he even got rid of my sisters two dogs because he’s too cheap to pay $50 monthly on kibble.

He’s skeptical about organic food even though I tell him it’s better and I send him organic products monthly and he will appreciate because it’s free but with the water system I think he’s too cheap to install it despite being a handyman bc it literally “wastes” more water.

I’m sad and angry that I have such a cheap father and although I’m a fuck up I like to blame him for the way he raised me in that trailer.

1ksg61c,would you consider this as a toxic household?,NoBumblebee3501,"i'm and only child so i never got the chance to have someone at home to rant with. my parents are loving sometimes. they buy me things i want like clothes or jewelry and they let me go to friends houses. they aren't awful, but they haven't been great either.

my mom has been cheating on my dad since i was 9 and she still is to the point where my best friend sees her emailing her lover when carpooling. my dad looks at young girls on facebook and sometimes watches corn. 

when i was younger (around 6-7) my parents would cuss me out calling me stupid or an idiot. i did confront them but they didn't stop. my dad grounded me for not fixing my bed or closing the windows when i left for a friends house. 

every time i cry in front of them they yell at me to stop so ive learned to hold back tears. 

they fight a lot. my dad has broken things before in anger. my mom yells all the time. my mom criticizes my weight. ""you're gaining so much weight!"" ""if u eat that ur gonna be so fat."" ""stop eating so much sugar."" some days i don't eat dinner because of this.

my friend wonders how i live in a place that should be called home. she wonders how im still living here. 

i'll admit some days im lazy. sometimes i can be forgetful. sometimes i lash out of them because im tired. 

i get scared every time my mom leaves on a trip to the point where i start crying even now. why? cuz as a punishment when i was 4-5, she would leave the house making me stay alone until i figured out she was just parked outside the garage. 

sometimes i feel like i should be grateful for what they do, but another part of me loathes this family. i couldn't hang out alone with my friends until freshman year of high school. my mom doesn't think i can cross a crosswalk. 

they don't let me go to places alone because they're scared since im their only child. but i know how to protect myself. the city i live in is also safe just the occasional package theft on the older side of town. 

maybe im overreacting and it isn't as bad as i think it is. my parents can be fun sometimes. my dad will play video games with me or we will have fun talks. we travel a lot together.

My(39F) mom(70) left me and my siblings(17M, 20F) when I was 14 to go to USA(She was 45) to work illegally and send us money (3rd world country). Everyday I was crying and upset because I couldn't understand it. She said we needed money. My grandmother and my aunt basically took care of me. I had a life-threatening illness when I was 16 but she said she couldn't go home because we won't survive. My grandmother died on 2018 and my mom couldn't go home because she said she didn't have money. My aunt died on 2019 and my mom said she can't go home because she didn't have money.

She went back home to our country after 7 years and didn't even want to actually spend time with us but would rather spend time with her friends. She had an argument with my aunt about spending time with me and my siblings. I get that I was already 21 and old enough.

Me(33F) and my brother(36M) traveled to USA as immigrants late 2019.

1ks5cbg,Do I need to get an emergency button for my elderly aunt who lives alone?,Great_Study_5322,"My 86-year-old aunt has always been fiercely independent. She still cooks, reads the newspaper every morning, and insists on keeping her garden going—even though her knees aren’t what they used to be. She lives alone in a small house about 30 minutes from me, and while she says she’s doing fine, I can’t help but worry every time she doesn’t answer the phone right away.  
  
Last winter, she slipped on her front steps but luckily didn’t break anything. That incident really stuck with me, and lately I’ve been thinking more seriously about some kind of emergency alert button or device she can use if something happens and she can’t reach the phone.  
  
I’ve been reading a lot of medical alert system reviews and looking into options that have things like automatic fall detection, wearable pendants, or wristbands. I’m especially interested in systems that offer a simple, one-press emergency button for elderly people who might be disoriented or hurt and need help fast. The last thing I want is for her to be lying there unable to call for assistance.  
  
The tricky part is getting her on board. She’s not tech-savvy and doesn’t want anything complicated or that makes her feel like she’s being watched. I’m hoping there are options that are discreet but reliable—something that gives her freedom while also giving us peace of mind.  
  
I’ve seen terms like “alert button for seniors,” “fall alert devices,” and “help buttons” thrown around, but I’m still not sure what’s actually effective versus what just sounds good on paper. Some of the reviews of medical alert systems seem too generic or sponsored to really trust.

1ks47tr,What should I do to have a better relationship with my sister-in-law?,heatherace,"Hey so I’m a 17 year old girl , and I’m having trouble getting along with my sister-in-law. As the title would suggest. She got married to my brother last December but my family and I have known her  for 4 years now. My parents had met her parents in college. #smallworld
But that’s a different story. 
So here is a bit about me I’m pretty much an extrovert so I have no problem getting along with anybody. And I’m often mistaken as a 24 year old (people say I don’t act my age) 
We both have very religious family’s and both of our fathers are pastors. 
This info will come in handy later.
So my sister-in-law (who I’ll be calling Abigail for this story) is 20 and she just graduated from college. She is from Wisconsin while we are from Illinois (we live in the Chicago area) 
So we all have different tastes in food,people, and humor. 
My family is really sarcastic and male centered (I’m the only girl out of 5 brothers and two other guys we kinda adopted) while she has a very Female centered family ( she is the second of 4 sisters and 2 boys)
So that’s a really big difference between us both. 
I have tried to be more like her by instead of wearing big and baggy clothes to wearing cute dresses and more of an feminine look, cause that’s how she dresses. 
And I try to be nice to her every time I see her. And I understand that it’s all new for her with just graduating and being married, but it’s like every time I’m by her she always looks at me a certain way, its like she is looking at a misbehaving little kid and it just makes everything awkward. 
As well as she talks to me like I’m a troubled child (I have been diagnosed with some mental illness, nothing insane)but it is frowned upon in my religion to not be perfect (especially because I’m a pastors kid) 
Also I have a very low immune system because of auto immune diseases, and I get sick really often and she often comments on the fact that I’ve not been at church in a while because of the fact that I’m sick. 
She has in a joking manner said that “it would be crazy if your just faking right”. 
Which I have had people think that and say that I’m just a “faker” so it doesn’t really bother me that much. 
But on Mother’s Day, she decided to go up to her families house to surprise her mom, she lives in Wisconsin, so it was about a 6hr drive up there, so she decided just to stay the night. 
So while she was gone, I asked my brother (that she married) if there was a problem between me and her. He told me that she feels I am in-mature and overly cliquish with the girls at my church (there’s only two and their sisters, plus I’ve known them since I was 10) she also feels that I am racist (The two girls in my church are Spanish, and since we live in the Chicago area, there are lots of different kinds of people. but I don’t think I’ve ever been racist towards them, I do acknowledge that we are different in culture and how we were raised, so I don’t know if that’s racist, but yeah) He also said that she thinks I am too Boy crazy(while being too guyish) he said that she also feels that I am very young for my age? ( which I don’t understand at all) so I asked my mom for her opinion on this, and she basically just said that my sister-in-law is going through a big change in her life. (Which I totally get it, but this change has been for like 5-6 months now) and my mom said that I should try to be more excepting of her, but I thought I was being pretty excepting of her? Also, she thinks very differently than I do, which is probably affecting our relationship as well. 
She says I just have to be the bigger person and that my sister-in-law still young. 
But we’ve been like a pastors kid you 
always have to be the bigger person, because you’re always doing extra stuff that nobody else does.
And my sister-in-law doesn’t get that, she doesn’t think we do anything extra(Also probably should have said this at the beginning, but she is my youth pastors wife) 
Which also makes it awkward. Honestly, I don’t know what to do.

1ks3waf,Brother wants me to lend a listening ear but is hurtful in his frustration,rilakkumkum,"I’m trying to keep things short. My brother (21M) and I (23F) are practically like best friends up until recently. He’s been really depressed for a few years due to a breakup affecting him and lately it’s come to a head. He now has mood swings, he flys into rages and it requires a very gentle touch to navigate it. Ive been the only one to really try to do this as my parents usually trigger him pretty badly, but lately I’m not helping either. In the past I’ve tried comforting him in many different ways such letting him know I relate, sometimes give advice, sometimes give positivity, and sometimes just telling him “yea that really does suck”, or but none of that helps and unfortunately comes across to him as me trying to solve his problems. 

When I directly ask him what he’d need for me to help him, unfortunately he contradicts himself and gets mad that I don’t understand, which I know can be frustrating but me also trying to understand also makes him upset. The only thing that has a bit more success, is to sit completely silent while he rants, but he’s usually saying really concerning things and it’s hard to simply just keep quiet and not say anything and I’m not allowed to show signs of distress. it goes beyond just blowing off steam but it’s often him threatening to harm himself, misogynist rhetoric. I’m only able to do this if I completely dissociate. 

Yesterday he asked me a question and I answered him honestly, I think he was seeking to be told what he wanted to hear without directly saying it but with what’s going on with him, it’s extremely dangerous because I know he would want justification for things like stalking and contacting someone that doesn’t want to be contacted, and more. (I have the texts on my account). He kept calling me things like useless, a waste of space and time, “can’t understand simple concepts”, and that he doesn’t care about anything I have to say, saying that I’m purposely not understanding and that I’ll probably understand when he ends his life, all while asking me to just sit there, but then would ask me to speak and then get mad again that I spoke. 

I’m feeling so hurt and deflated because I know he’s seeking me out, but I feel like I’ve become his punching bag for misdirected emotions and it’s resulted in a lot of mental and verbal abuse. I still want to try and help him but how can I navigate this if he’s being so hurtful towards me and I’m not allowed to even attempt to understand what he wants?",2,1,1747848932.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ks3waf/brother_wants_me_to_lend_a_listening_ear_but_is/
1ks3vwr,growing resentment towards dad as i get older (LONG READ),babymochilala,"When I was a little girl my dad was an alcoholic, he had a sunday league team and was getting drunk almost every weekend after games or at party’s we would go to, making me fear for the weekend or anytime we were invited to an event since he was an angry drunk. My mom, sister and I would have to hide from him (he wouldn’t hit us but would punch walls and scream terrible things) and would have to hide the car keys from him so he wouldn’t drive off and put someone else’s life in danger.i remember one christmas we were in the living room and my dad was drunk and angry at my mom cause me and my sister were crying terrified at him, but he thought my mom was trying to scare us “on purpose” so he grabbed the christmas tree and knocked it down (the tree me and my sister loved putting up every year) and i could vividly remember seeing the tree go down and a santa ornament shattering on the floor (it was santa claus on a swing).

Even when he was sober he was a mean person, he has so much hatred towards my 3 half siblings (i forget we’re half siblings and just call them my regular siblings). One time my parents were going to some event and one of my half sisters who was like 16 at the time was upset cause she had to babysit me and my biological sister, so my dad got mad at starting hitting her hard with a belt (she is not his biological daughter) and it was traumatizing having to see that. i understand that kind of discipline is “normalized” in mexican households but i could see he did it out of anger and hatred. and yes, everything i am talking about is and was tolerated by my mother (she’d yell at him but that’s the most she’d do). my half brother always tried staying on my dads good side but for some reason my dad just doesn’t like my half siblings. One time my dad was drunk he literally threatened to kill my brother just because he took a while to unlock the front door for us after coming home from a cook out. 

This is actually very nasty but at my old house i had to share a room with my biological sister and parents, my sister had a bed and my parents had their own bed while i slept on the floor. One morning I sit up and when I turn towards my parents bed and look up I literally see them having sex. mind you my sisters bed was right next to theirs, she would’ve saw the whole things the moment she’d open her eyes. My dad would also touch my mom provocatively in front of us as well when we were little girls (did they think we wouldn’t remember?). He also to this day has a bad p*rn addiction, we all shared one computer and every time i’d open it i’d just see naked women. i tried looking up “ponies” because i was like 6 and a p*rn website was pre-typed after i put po. Also when we were at the beach he would use the camera we took for family photos to record women in bikinis on the beach. 

This is why I’ve never and will never bring my female friends near him. As my two half siblings started getting older my dad would kick them out multiple times. One day I came home from school and noticed my half sister wasn’t home (the one my dad hit with a belt) and me and my bio sister started crying because my half sister and brother literally were our second parents, i consider my brother a much better father figure than my own dad. My dad got annoyed because me and my sister would stop crying (WE WERE CHILDREN) and he threatened to leave us and find a family that would actually love him. He literally manipulated us at 6 and 8 years old. He was jealous of my half siblings and wanted my mom all to himself.

about 2 years ago my bio sister passed away, it was and still is the worst thing our family has ever been through. at the time and point my half siblings are in their 30s and have their own families, we all tried changing for the better since this really opened up our eyes. My dad’s health wasn’t so great. He’s diabetic and from the stress he currently has an hemorrhage in one of his eyes. Due to his diabetes and medication he can no longer drink nor become erect (he doesn’t speak english so i unfortunately had to translate that to him) because it can potentially kill him. His health changed but his personality never changed, he is still a miserable and hateful man. 4 months after my sister passed we found out he was having an affair with his ex girlfriend in mexico and went to see her on a trip once when he went alone. Everything my dad does disgust me at this point, he’s unhygienic, doesn’t clean up after himself, and doesn’t flush the toilet all the way. he literally waits all day until my mom gets home to work because refuses to cook. he says he’ll change but if he really wanted he would’ve done it by now.

i think the universe tried bringing me a guy just like him (my ex) into my life as a test and realized just in time that i could’ve potentially repeated the same story with my parents and broke up with him. there is so much more i could’ve mentioned but it would’ve been an extremely long read. i thank those who read towards the end cause it feels so good letting this out even if it’s through typing.

1kryw9h,My son (19) wants to marry his girlfriend but i think he's way too young and naïve. How can i get through to him?,AntiAnimeMom,"The main reason why is because he's only 19 and i think is too young to get married, they have no money to move out, they've only been together 1 year, and her parents don't approve of their relationship

About 9 months ago, her parents forced them to seperate because they wanted her to focus on her career and not socializing. They confiscated her phone and made her cut ties with him. She finally got back in touch with him and feels bad about the abrupt ending. She said her parents don't want them to be together, she wants more freedom but they want her to just work. I overheard them talking, she said the only way she could get any freedom is if she got married and maybe they'd start treating her like an adult. He told me she's not allowed to speak to him and her parents might get mad.

My son took that as her saying they should get married. He's talking abotu seeing signs like seeing 222 everywhere. It makes perfect sense to him.

He thinks this is what will rescue his girlfriend from her family and let them be together.

I don't like his girlfriend so much, if i'm being honest. Plus Her parents likely are not gonna let them be together. I think he can do better. She was always asking for money, got him to throw a birthday party for her when he had no money, he spent his birthday money on her and bought her takeout. I think she's using him. And i just feel like that there's more to the story of why her parents have so little trust in her, i've talked to her mom a few times and she's never told me exactly what she did to lose their trust. I've just seen some signs, but my son says i'm projecting. Her mom doesn't seem that bad when i've interacted with her. Plus she has a sister who her mom isn't as strict with, it's just his GF

I want him to think about this in the long term and not just impulsively jump into this because he wants to see his girlfriend more. How can i talk to him about this?",1,6,1747836881.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kryw9h/my_son_19_wants_to_marry_his_girlfriend_but_i/

1krvsri,"I'm the last one in the family my dad will still talk to, and I don't know what to make of it.",Ok_Practice_6702,"I grew up with a lot of siblings, most of them younger.  My dad kind of wasn't really the best father even though he was supportive at times.  The marriage with my mom never seemed really genuine even when I was little, and when we were in our early 30s, they finally got divorced.  

My mom and dad stayed friends for awhile.  My mom remarried shortly after and my dad had been in several relationships, some good women, others who were taking advantage of him because they assumed he was rich due to his job when he is not. 

My dad finally found someone he decided to marry when they had known each other about half a year, and they got married a few months later.  Since then, my dad's wife doesn't allow him to talk to my mom, he got nasty towards my younger siblings because his wife said he either wanted them in his life or her, and he picked her.  He used to love the time he spent with his grandkids, my nieces and nephew, and then he was only allowed to see them for one hour at a time when they came into town, but now he isn't allowed to see them at all.  When I was vacationing near friends by where he lives, he asked me out to dinner, but then he said he isn't allowed to pay for mine after I accepted.  After I mentioned a story in person relating to my mom that had absolutely nothing to do with either of them, when I left, she yelled at him because she doesn't want to hear my mom's name at all.  He can't answer to any comments I make about old family memories and he has to act as if he was never married before her.  

My dad has never really known moderation.  He doesn't drink every day, but when he is watching a game or something, he can't just have 2 or 3 beers and be done.  He has to drink until he can't handle anymore and passes out.  My mom wasn't controlling at all, so he did whatever he wanted and left my mom to do all the parenting work while he was out all the time with friends.  



So, I don't really understand what causes him to be this way.  Either he can't moderate a controlling wife and put his foot down, so he allows her to ruin his relationships with his family, he is inherently a bad person and only cares about the here and now and not anyone else's feelings but hers, or she has something on him such as a crime he committed that only she knows about or she has threatened to harm him in some way if he ever leaves her.    
  
I'm the last person left he still texts, but I only respond when he messages me first, but even I don't really want to talk with him anymore, and my texts get more and more vague and robotic with him as time goes on.  He just isn't the same person anymore.  He looks like he has been brainwashed and has no life left in him.  His wife doesn't even work and doesn't even contribute financially, so he isn't dependent on her.  So, what could be so important about this relationship that he is willing to cut ties with people he used to care about just to appease her?

1krtcy1,My dad is a cheating asshole and I don’t want him walking me down the aisle,Elli_5677,"English isn’t my first language, so please bear with me.

I’m  (32 f) have two brothers from both my parents (35, 28). My father (60) cheated on my mom at least twice that I know of. In my country, you need a religious court to approve a divorce. During the process, my dad told the judge he wanted to leave because my mom was messy and the house was always dirty. At the time, she was working full time while raising two kids and a baby.

My mom told the judge, “Yes, the house is messy. I’m working hard while he’s having an affair. He came here straight from another woman’s bed.”
Right after the divorce, he married that same woman and had two daughters with her. He introduced her to everyone before the divorce was even final, so everyone knew he was cheating. But we were little  and only understood the truth years later.

After the divorce, he did try to be a good father. He visited twice a week and made an effort. I’m on good terms with my half-sisters.
 in his new house there were only pictures of his new family. I told him it hurt — and he said, “It’s my wife’s decision, I don’t get involved.” Later, I noticed he did hang photos of his parents, so clearly he gets involved when he wants to.


A 2 years ago, he divorced that second wife. Honestly, I was glad. She was always bitter and angry, constantly making “jokes” about how cheap and ugly he was. Later, I found out he probably cheated on her too. He says he didn’t, but he introduced us to his new girlfriend before finalizing the divorce. I asked him not to tell his daughters (then 18 and 10) right away — they were still in shock — but of course he couldn’t help himself. He had to tell them how happy he was and how miserable he’d been with their mom. (I even know he and his ex slept together one last time three years ago. Thanks, Dad.)

He also told my mom how tired he was of the woman he wrecked our family for. He doesn’t get that he’s doing the exact same thing again. He pressured my half-sisters to meet the new girlfriend even though they were still heartbroken, and lied to them, saying I suggested it. My older half-sister figured out he cheated and hasn’t spoken to him in over a year and a half. He still doesn’t understand why.

Now I’m getting married. In my culture, the bride is walked down the aisle by both parents. I don’t want him to walk with me. I used to be angry, now I’m just numb. I keep in touch for the sake of family peace. But I know that if he walks me, every step will remind me of the two families he destroyed because he couldn’t control himself — always chasing happiness without caring about the consequences. I barely speak to my half-sister now, and every conversation with my grandmother ends in tears because she still thinks he’s an angel and “no one understands him.” (She’s 90 and doing her best. I’m not mad at her.)

I just know he’ll ruin that special moment with my future husband.

I want my older brother to walk me down the aisle with my mom. He loves his wife more than anything, and that’s the energy I want around me when I say my vows. But I know my brother won’t agree, and my mom will probably say I need to forgive my dad because “he tries.”

The wedding is still a long way off, but I think about it all the time. I don’t have the energy to fight or explain  why my dad won’t be walking me down the aisle — even though he’s still present in my life.

I don’t know what to do.",21,28,1747818819.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1krtcy1/my_dad_is_a_cheating_asshole_and_i_dont_want_him/

1krpwlf,Unequal Distribution of Household Expenses,Ambitious-Pomelo-700,"Hello,

In case of a couple (or a family = couple + kids), do you find it normal to do 50-50 split for all expenses? By that, I mean rent/mortgage, groceries, kids stuff,  trips, restaurants, etc. Basically, anything that is not strictly personal.

I heard from a friend earning much less than her partner that they do 50-50 and I find it so unfair for her. 

Imo, the distribution/spilt should reflect the level of income of both partners. In case partner A earn 20% more than partner B, then A should pay 20% more than B. I had no idea some couples were not following this ""rule"".

1krp0lr,"My mom's evicting my sister, I'm torn.",ExaminationLife6833,"My(f45) have always had a delicate balance between my mom(75f) and my sister (48f). My sister has always been narcissistic,  the perpetual victim,  and my mom played favorites. 

This trickled down to our kids. She has 5, I have 4. Because my mom and I have always been close, she had a close relationship with my kids.

My sister's kids, mind you now adults,  only show up at Christmas.  

My mom has always been absurd at Christmas to ALL her grandkids. But when birthdays became if mom was invited she acknowledged,  but if not she didn't.  

I haven't always agreed with my mom. I pointed out throughout the years times she could've been more attentive to my sister and her family, but likewise my sister and her kids have done things I felt intentionally excluded my mom. 

The biggest being when my sisters oldest daughter got married.  She never invited my mom, yet had  a life size cut out of our late father as part of her wedding party. My parents were married for 30 years until he passed,  he was very in love with our mom. 

So to have this cut out at a wedding my mom wasn't invited to was a slap in my mom's face. He would never attend anything his wife was not invited to.  

My sister and her kids have done similar things throughout the years. 

Then 2.5 years ago my mom had a heart attack and stroke. Her entire personality changed. 

Enough of a change where my sister came to her when she lost her house and needed a place to live, due to legal reasons. Granted her being at my moms assisted me in her caretaking. Which I can't pretend didn't help me. It opened up my evenings and weekends when she was there, easing my burden. But it also gave my sister a place while she dealt with legal issues. 

The last months things have changed. 

My husband and I had to move in because mom needed more care.

My sister's legal issues were resolved. 

And mom started asking me how long my sister was staying. Her main concern (bomb drop) was that my sister's husband may soon be paroled.  

We've never met this man, my sister married him while in prison.  But she keeps saying he should be out soon. 

So my mom figured it be better to ask her to leave sooner than later. If we wait until her ""Sancho"" was released she might expect him to move in with us.

So mom asked....

""What's your plan? Do you plan on getting a place soon?""

Since then(9days) she won't speak to my mom or I. She stormed out of the room and only is seen when going from the backdoor to her room. 

I know in my sister's mind we let her stay here while I lived away and needed her help. Which there is some truth to that. But now I'm here 24/7 and the idea of her husband being released is terrifying,  not to mention her kids continue to be very disrespectful,  including coming over on mothers day, going to my sister's room via the backdoor and never saying hi or happy mothers day to their grandmother. 

I feel like if my mom is such a horrible mom/grandmother then why live under her roof?

1krnmln,I am not sure how to feel about the current situation with my sister,Mean_Release_143,"This is a long post but, I feel like I need to share all of details to get advice on what to do in this current situation.

Ten years ago when I was twelve years old I was living in California with my mom, dad, brother and sister ( who I’ll call Olivia) and some of my extended family. During this time period, there was family drama between my mom and dad, because my dad was having an affair, and my parents decided to get a divorce. Before I lived in California my family and I lived in Rhode Island. During the summer my mom was planning on taking me and my two siblings back to Rhode Island, because she thought we would be happier there, since that's where I met all of my childhood friends, and we could escape all of the toxic family drama associated with my father. Olivia was about eighteen or nineteen during this time.

Before we moved though Olivia  ended up not coming back to Rhode Island, and instead ended up staying with my father. This is also because Olivia  met a guy who she was dating at the time, who I thought she wanted to stay with. When my mom and brother and I moved back to Rhode Island, we kept in touch with Olivia . We would text and call each other regularly, and when I was in seventh grade I remember she came to visit us during my winter break around christmas time, and she came to visit again during the summer, and the next summer after that, when I was about to go into high school. After the last time that she came to visit things became more distant between us. I remember the last time she came to visit my mom and Olivia  would get into arguments and not get along.

When I was in high school, things became more distant between Olivia  and the rest of our family. We would try and reach out to her, by calling and texting her, and it got to a point where I would only rarely hear back from her. The more time went on the less and less she would talk to us/ I would send her text messages and call her and she would rarely answer. My mom told me that one time it got to a point where my father felt like he had to call the police to check up on Olivia , and apparently during this time she said that she doesn't want anything to do with her family.  My aunt and my grandmother were also very concerned since Olivia  wasn't talking to them either and she's usually very close with them. One time  I remember when we talked on the phone I asked her why she won't talk to mom and why she's been so distant. She told me that she feels resentment towards my mother, because of stuff that she did to Olivia  in the past, but, when I tried to ask Olivia  what she was talking about she wouldn't tell me, and that it was just between her and my mother.

About six months ago, some things happened with Olivia  and her boyfriend who she was with for nine years, and eventually she ended up moving back to the east coast, to live with my mother and I. During the time that she's been living here, I've noticed that Olivia  seems different. When we saw each other six months ago when she came back it was the first time we had seen each other in seven years. Things were very awkward at first, and she seemed different. One time Olivia  and I had a talk, and she feels like we abandoned her. She also expressed this to my mother when she came back.

When we talked about this Olivia , said that my mother never asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island, with my mom, my brother, and I. Olivia  said that she talked about this with my mom, and my mom says that she did ask Olivia  if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us, but Olivia  insists that my mom was gaslighting her, and that she never asked her if she wanted to move back to Rhode Island. Olivia  basically thinks that we just decided to move to Rhode Island. I also talked to my mom about this, and my mom says that she asked Olivia  if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island with us, and according to my mom Olivia  said that she didn't want to come because she didn't like Rhode Island. Olivia  said that us moving to Rhode Island happened so suddenly, which I don't remember, because I knew that we were moving back to Rhode Island during that year, before the summer started, and I knew that she must have known something about way before then, since me and my family members were all talking about it.

I remember when we talked about this that Olivia  also admitted that when she came to visit when I was in middle school that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back and live with us, and Olivia  said that she felt like this was manipulation, so she turned the offer down. I just don't understand Olivia 's logic behind this. So she wished that my mom asked her if she wanted to come back to Rhode Island, and then when my mom finally asks her to come move in, was it somehow manipulation? My mother also doesn't see how we abandoned her, because when I was in high school she says that we did nothing but keep in touch with Olivia , and that we even sent her gifts during the pandemic, and we let her come visit during the times I mentioned previously. My mom doesn't see how we abandoned her, when she feels like we did nothing to keep Olivia  in our lives, while we were apart.

What really bugged me during my and Olivia 's conversation, is that when I told her that I tried to text and call her while we were apart, she said that she ""doesn't care about a call or a text"" and that she wanted to see me. I feel like that's unfair because I don't see how she expects me to make plans to see her if she just decided to disappear and not respond to messages. How else did she want me to communicate with her when we were across the country from each other.  I feel like that's also unfair of her to say that, because I was twelve years old when all of that happened, and I was a literal child too, so I feel like I didn't really have much of a say in the matter. My choices were to either go with my mom, or to stay with my dad, who was literally cheating on my mom at the time, and was a toxic person to be around. The way I see it I didn't really have much of a choice. I just feel like the distance between our relationship isn't my fault given the circumstances at the time.

Lately since Olivia  has been back, I am always feeling like there is tension in the house. Olivia  just comes and goes and barely speaks to anybody and just goes off to our room by herself and rarely comes out. I've been home from college recently, and she's hardly said anything to me. Yesterday, my mom and Olivia  got into a heated argument because my mom, who has been dealing with this everyday since Olivia  got back. What happened was my mom was trying to have a conversation with her about why she barely talks to anybody, and what’s going on with her, and Olivia  just blatantly walked away from her while my mother was talking to her. My mom lost her patience and went into our room to confront Olivia  and they both got into a heated argument.

Today I mentioned to my mom about how Olivia  and I were having a conversation and she said that she tried to call me back multiple times while I was away at college this semester and that I didn't call her back. I told her that I was busy with school and I was also really busy with making a short film that I wrote and directed. She then said ""Well you tried to call mom while you were gone, so that excuse isn't going to work."" When I mentioned this to my mom, my mom was upset about that, because she felt like Olivia  was bullying me and that her behavior was manipulative. I said that by her tone of voice, that it sounded like Olivia  said this in jest, but, my mom said that you don't need to have a certain tone, and that Olivia  was trying to make me feel like I did something wrong even though I didn't, and that I really don't owe here an explanation. My sister is staying with us right now, and in two months she’s leaving to go to boot camp for the army. 

I'm just not sure what to feel about this and I am not sure what to do about this whole situation. 

TL;DR: Olivia  has been distant between us, and she recently moved back from California to live with me and my mother. There has been tension between her and my mother, and the rest of us. I am not sure how to feel about this or what to do.

1krn6hc,My older brothers emotions are all over the place and he constantly shuts me out. Advice?,born_to_be_wild2010,"My brother 16m and I 15f grew up super close since we're only 13 months apart. As kids, we spent every waking second with each other. Yes we fought often, but we did EVERYTHING together, wore similar clothes, etc. My mom got sick a while back (she's better now) and my grandparents traveled a lot, so my brother and I were all we had.

When he was 12-14 he didnt speak a word to me. Needless to say, it took a toll on me. I've always loved my brother so incredibly much and this past year we've gotten close again. We played baseball together, hung out together, we have the same friends, hes protective of me, i love it right. 

Now these last few months he's been so angry. All the time for no reason. Like I went downstairs to his room and said ""Hey wanna order taco bell"" and he was like ""why would even ask me that"" and got all huffy with me.

We do have a lot going on at home, and I dont know if that's the reason, but things are still normal so idk. He has severe ADHD, and depression. He took my moms car at night and he got pulled over and is currently fighting court (well technically not yet) so idk if he's stressed out or what.

I just need advice on how to keep our relationship close, once my family's gone, my brother and I are all we have. It's like he has major mood swings cause 1 week ago we were planning on where were gonna move to when were older and how we wanna live close so our kids can grow up close to us.

I just dont know what's going on, it's not like mood swings when we were 12-13, like ot doesn't seem like a teenager thing, hes just angry. My worst fear is him comm!ting, like it's not too severe but some nights it can be. Shutout to our best friend who keeps us all in tact. I'm just worried he's gonna leave me or cut me off.

1krlsk7,"My younger brother gives me no respect, am i in the wrong?",,"I (17F) have a younger brother (14M) who I was very close to. Our family and siblings (i have two older siblings) are actually quite close. My two older sisters were especially really close when they were younger as well. Me and my brother did EVERYTHING together, from painting, going on walks, having sleepovers in each other's rooms watching movies, playing outside, everything. We obviously used to fight, but that's normal. 

Now he turns 12/13, and he starts ya know becoming awkward (wearing headphones a lot, being obsessed with a girl group, not as talkative) and it was really hard for me to deal with that because he slowly stopped doing things with me. I am a very caring sister, and can tend to be a little clingy, or too caring sometimes, so I used be sad when he officially stopped doing anything with me. I used to be concerned for him, (you know watching something he's not supposed to, getting too addicted to his phone or attached to online stuff (just bc that's not really how the culture of our house is either)) so if he ever was doing anything he wasn't supposed to, I used tell my parents. Now it got to a point, where my brother said he needed his boundaries, and I had to give up on trying to do things with him, so I listened and i backed off bc my parents said to just leave him be. I know it may sound like I was controlling or not giving him space, but if u look at it from my perspective, I just wanted to do some sort of activity with him, even if it was something I didn't like bc all I wanted to do was spend some time with my brother. And in our home, its not very common for siblings to be so distant like that. (my two older siblings are in uni and busy). 

Anyways, I back off, and for the last year or so, I never ask him to do anything with me bc he gets outbursts. I respect his space, his privacy, and don't tattletale on him anymore (i was 14/15 at the time when i did tattletale lol) He gets mad and irritated really easily, and its only always at me. The problem is is that he doesn't behave this way to any of his older siblings. just to me. 

Example from recent times: I into his room to say goodnight, or to tell him something, he gets irritated. but when my older sister goes in his room 8 times within an hour, he doesn't have any problem (bc they have similar interests in that girl group and music ig). I always talk and treat him with respect, and am always so nice to him, bc he's my younger brother. But when it comes to how he talks to me, he calls me a ""baby, a brat, someone who leeches off of their parents money for the rest of my life"" (bc he buys albums ig and its with his own money, but we both buy clothes and everything with our parents money) Is that something appropriate to say to an older sister, even when i didn't even say anything to initiate this comment to be said?? 

I got into a university close to home, and another one 4 hours away. He always tells me why dont I move out and go somewhere far away bc he doesn't want me living in the house with him for the next 4 years. But I want to go to the close university, so i can take care of my parents, and reduce expenses on them (they also prefer i stay home). But he talks as if he's my parent, trying to tell me right or wrong and what decision I should be making for myself. He tries to prove how mature he is at 14 years old compared to me, by making hurtful comments. 

Yesterday we had a huge fight, over a table! basically my dad had wanted me to sell a table on facebook marketplace so i could make some money, and kept it in the backyard for me, and my brother came out and started throwing it out without any of our parents direction to do so. I'm telling him repeatedly that I am gonna be selling it and my dad was there as well (but didnt say anything) and he pushed me multiple times and wasn't listening. Then (based on what my parents have told me) i went to my mum and told her that he isn't listening and what should i do, and i went back out and  told him mum said that we are selling it! leave it! and he said, ""why dont we sell all of your stuff! Why don't we get rid of you! Why can't leave so i dont have to see you ever again, you're such an obstacle in my life"" And he said all this hurtful stuff over something so trivial and that he wasn't even supposed to do. And this is with me saying absolutely nothing, except arguing that we are keeping the table.

Yesterday my parents had a talk with him that that's not how you are supposed to behave and that he should apologize, and he said he meant every word, and its true. That im a baby, and im sheltered and that my parents SHOULD be sending me away. and this isnt the first time he's said such hurtful things, sometimes he says them randomly and uncalled for, when i do absolutely nothing. I usually just ignore them, but it's like he bullies me everyday by saying something hurtful. I dont bother him, i dont force him, even sometimes we'll be friends and he'll talk to me about school, but then the next moment or the next time he sees me he'll start talking rudely again. 

now to wrap up, my parents had a talk with me, and said I, APPAPRENTLY ME, have to never go in his room anymore and dont talk to him. My brother's reasoning for this behavior is that ""its been building up"" bc i left a paper on the ground when he was cleaning, and I played with his blinds (he fell asleep on the ground at 1am and his light and blinds were open, so i was abt to close them for him and he screamed at me), and that me saying goodnight to him in his room is an ""intrusion of space"" but when my older sister does it its totally okay??? 

TLDR What am i doing wrong? My dad says that I don't need to talk to him, he'll do activities with me, but my mom is telling me to not talk to him at all, and that i shouldnt play with his blinds! IS THAT THE ISSUE HERE, THAT IM ABT TO PUT DOWN THE BLINDS BUT HE DIDNT LIKE THAT SO ITS JUSTIFIABLE TO TELL ME TO DISAPPEAR?? He has never given me respect as an older sister in the recent years, and ive tried so hard to be interested in the stuff he likes so we get along better but nothing works. I feel lost and that im going to have to distance myself from my only other sibling who lives in the same house with me (bc we have a closer age gap) we went from being like best friends, to hating me everyday.

1krioub,So tired of translating for my mom.,Beneficial-Device426,"This is mostly a rant, and I want to make it explicitly clear that my mom is not hard of hearing. She does not have cognitive impairment either. She's just fucking nosy. And she does this thing that drives me crazy. 
No matter who is talking, or who they're talking to, she'll ask me what someone just said. Every. Single. Time. It's honestly exhausting.
Tonight, she's over to my house for dinner. She's on one end of my couch, I'm on the other. My wife is across the room having an intentionally quiet conversation with my daughter. 
She leans over into my space, ""What'd she say?""

I say, ""Oh, she was talking to (my kid).""

Then it starts. She goes, ""I just wanna know. Is that so bad?""

Then as per usual, she blows up because she's ""not allowed to do anything"" and we ""all gide things from her"". 

I know this probably sounds so silly to most people but...I'm so tired. It's exhausting to stop what I'm doing and give her a play by play. Plus, 9/10, it does not concern her.

1krelk8,Should I intervene in my sister's failing marriage,Remarkable_Scheme250,"Hi everyone I (20M) am the younger brother of my  older sister (31F) yes I know too much of a generation gap . I wanted some advice on the issue that might be leading onto a divorce .My sister was married more than an year ago and after around 4 months of marriage my brother in law and she were starting to have issues as she was more of an extrovert and manmani ( self important) person as she always wanted herself to be right now one else get to be right that's how it was when would visit our home before marriage and my father and mother would leave her as it is and won't confront her or force her she was always at her own will .So after marriage this thing affected her too much as my brother in law was an entirely different and new person to her due to an arranged marriage via shaadi or some other site idk it was though online matching and she though that she would get away with everyone like she used to so in the early days of the marriage she would live with him in banglore and would do nothing but sleep and game in her pc and would not do any chores and my brother in law would go to the office and also do the chores for her please don't take this in the bad way I'm just explaining the situation. But he was okay with it and she also living with him changed but the first problem came when his friends started visiting their flat as being all male freinds they would talk about anything and mind u not they once said to her that she was fat and my brother in law did not even tell them to stop instead laughed with them I don't know the full context but something like this happened so as a result of this she was so angry that she walked out of the flat and and my brother in law held her by her hand and demanded that she remains in the flat to this she became angrier and shrieked and went inside a room in front of his friends this happened and that when she called home to tell that she is not going to be with him.
My mother and father tried to console her after endless conversations ith finally ended but with mixed feelings she cut the call saying she'll look into it . This was first incident I got to know and the second incident happened during Diwali night was also when some of his friends were taking and one thing or the other she was offended by his friends and again she was going to leave the flat and go out but this time he held her by her neck and said you are not going to go out but this time she held firm and went out crying and said to my mother on the phone that she wants a divorce without any thought it was one of the worst diwali i experienced in my life the darkest my mother and father both talked to her for endless hours trying to console her but this time she was not ready to even go to his house and he also was not ready to talk to her as according to him she was going out in front of my brother in law's sister and her fiancee. So after a week by staying in a hostel after the diwali night she came to a conclusion to return to my dad and mom's place and live with them .I was busy with my college so I want sure of what convos they had but I knew for sure that this is serious with the tone I heard from the phone . So after living with my mom and dad for 2 months my brother in law's ender brother also came to my house for taking to my sister but she says unless my brother in law apologizes she won't talk to him and same case with my brother in law he won't apologise also was not even unhappy of what happened he bought a new bike after my sis left his house and would send messages to my sister that I am doing fine without any problems no need to come back and what not this was told to me by my sis i don't know how much is true but some seems to be . So after all this comes to the current day she is currently with him now as she has to attend some kathak completiotion so she is in blr and from her conversation with me it seems she does not even talk to him while in the same house and is yet to give a clear info if she is going forward or not with the marriage. 

Please let me know if I should take any step as my parents have lost all hope of anything and also my brother in law's family have also lost hope of anything  whom should I talk to or leave everything as it is as both of them are fighting for very childish reasons according to me I would love to have your opinions....

.  He yells at her when she doesn’t hear something, 

.  He makes her cook for him when he can do it himself (she has COPD which is breathing issues)

.  He doesn’t help her with bills 

.  He’s had the police called on him my a neighbour for yelling at her (they could hear through the walls) and he’s spent a night in prison. And my grandma still thinks he’s the victim and justifies it.

.  (This one might sound odd) my grandma tells me he likes going out doing things, but as soon as I come over and stay he doesn’t want to go out and just stays in the house.

.  The few times we have gone out. He gets angry when me or my grandma want to look at something we want to look at and storms off and yells that we’ve been taking too long when it’s literally been two seconds


I know some of those things might sound petty on my part but it’s upsetting for me. You might think “I should talk to him about it” but trust me he’s not the type you can have a conversation with. You could say hello and he wouldn’t say a word or you could ask a question and he’d straight up ignore you. 

My grandma justifies everything he does when the few times I’ve criticised his behaviour and she says “he has a different way of doing things” she doesn’t condemn him at all. And the whole situation makes me feel like crap. 

My grandma asked my mother (age 56) some years back to help her sort her will out, and she refused to tell my mother what’s in her will despite asking her for help. Me and my mother are worried about when my grandma passed away she’s going to give my uncle all her money and give my mother, me (age 20) and my sister (age 17) nothing, I know that might sound horrible, I don’t want my grandma gone. It’s just the future that scares me. 

I’d like some advice or reassurance. It would be greatly appreciated. I’m feeling extremely down, hopeless, angry and frustrated. 

Thank you if you read this :))

1kr8q35,Parents leaving for trip to Italy while my grandma recovers from hip surgery,Babypenquin,"I don't know if this is just a rant or if I need advice. 

My grandma is scheduled for a hip replacement tomorrow and will need someone with her 24/7 once she is released from the hospital. My parents are leaving on a 10 day trip to Italy 2 days after my grandma's surgery. My siblings and I  work full time jobs and are figuring out a schedule to have one of us be at her house so she is not alone (I work on the weekends as well). For context, my mom is a teacher and is now on summer break so her schedule is a lot more free and my dad works from home. When I asked them why they decided it was ok to leave at a time like this they just said they really needed this trip and there was no other way to reschedule it.
My parents knew about my grandma's surgery weeks before buying the plane tickets. 

So now my siblings are very stressed with trying to make sure my grandma has help and my grandma is also very upset with my dad for leaving as he is her son. There's nothing I can really do at this point other than be there for her. I just feel like my parents are being incredibly selfish for leaving.

1kr7lue,Should I just give up trying to be close with my sister. 29M,Initial-Car1324,"Our family isnt really a tight-knit family, well atleast to me.

I would say im a perfect example of a middle child syndrome. Parents raised me but i dont think they actually care for me as much they do to other siblings.
The relationships with my siblings (3 of them) arent that great either. We are basically room mates. 

I really try to get along with my little sister 19F. I care for her on my own way. I wouldnt say im perfect but im trying. I try to provide for her and just be an ok brother.

This little sister does have an attitude sometimes. She sulks a lot and its a pain to talk to her when she does.

Recently we had a fight, im also to blame. She asked for something and i kinda give an annoyed response. I was talking to her after that but she gives me this one word response that ticked me off. Out of frustration, i said Ill be taking my laptop (she borrows it) and she can get it back when she is ready to talk. She blew up, literally.

Have to calm her down. And i realized my fault. I talked to her, saying im sorry to no avail. 
 
All of this just makes me thing that maybe i should just give up trying to establish a relationship i want with her.

I envy families/siblings that are close with each other and are like friends. 
Thats why i try my best with my her but I can feel like she doesnt want that. I feel like my efforts will just go to waste.

I will still be her brother and if she needs me I will be there for her.

1kr5nha,The Families We Create: Families of Choice,VirtualFarm6766,"**The Families We Create: Families of Choice**

In every life, there comes a moment when the idea of “family” is stripped of its assumptions, its inherited definitions, and its polite holiday cards. In that moment—whether during a crisis, a rite of passage, or a quiet recognition—we begin to understand that family is not always about blood, shared names, or birth certificates. Sometimes, it is about something far more intentional. This is the heart of the concept known as “families of choice.” These are the families we create. Not the ones we are born into, but the ones we build—carefully, sometimes urgently, and always with deep longing for belonging, safety, and love.

Sociologist and human services scholar Dr. Katherine Van Wormer, formerly of the University of Northern Iowa, was one of the earliest voices to articulate the critical, functional, and psychosocial importance of these alternative family systems. Her work, grounded in both social work and systems theory, emphasized that families of choice are not merely stand-ins for broken biological units; they are resilient, evolving ecosystems that meet emotional, relational, and often spiritual needs more effectively than traditional kinship networks.

While much of the discourse surrounding families of choice has been popularized through LGBTQ+ narratives—and for good reason, given how often queer individuals have been exiled from their families of origin—it is essential to widen the lens. Van Wormer and others make clear that this phenomenon transcends identity categories. Survivors of domestic violence, adults estranged from abusive parents, formerly incarcerated individuals, people living with disabilities, and even trauma-exposed youth aging out of the foster care system all demonstrate patterns of creating or gravitating toward chosen families. These alternative families offer an anchor where none existed, or a raft when one’s original family was the storm.

At the center of any family of choice is the idea of relational agency. Members elect to love one another, to show up consistently, and to accept roles that may or may not mirror those found in traditional households. The bonds formed are not less real because they are chosen. If anything, they often surpass in strength because they are not based on obligation but on trust, reciprocity, and shared experience. Dr. Van Wormer notes that “the formation of these networks often provides the very foundation of survival and psychological well-being,” particularly for individuals navigating systemic marginalization or intergenerational trauma.

Consider the elderly woman estranged from her children but supported daily by a tight circle of friends who celebrate her birthday, take her to medical appointments, and ensure her dignity remains intact as her body weakens. Or the disabled veteran who finds in his support group a new tribe—men and women who call every Sunday, who know his triggers, who bring laughter on dark days. Or the adult child of an alcoholic who builds a life with friends who never shame her silence or require her to pretend. These examples are not exceptions. They are becoming the new rule.

One of the most striking psychosocial outcomes of families of choice is the role they play in identity development. Just as a traditional family can shape one’s early sense of self through values, language, and customs, a chosen family can offer a corrective. For many, their chosen family becomes the first environment in which they are seen fully, respected for who they are rather than who they were expected to be. Van Wormer’s studies on recovery communities—especially among people healing from addiction or trauma—highlight how intentional networks of care offer “mirroring and modeling,” two vital components of identity formation and emotional regulation. In such communities, individuals not only feel safe enough to show their pain but also learn new patterns of intimacy and accountability.

The deliberate formation of these families often requires unlearning what was taught in bloodline households: that loyalty is blind, that abuse must be tolerated, that love is conditional. The families we create ask something radically different. They ask us to love with intention, to support without control, to stay without strings. These families are not transactional; they are transformational. Through them, many people experience for the first time what Van Wormer called “compassionate resilience”—the capacity to remain emotionally available despite past wounds, precisely because those wounds have been held, honored, and healed in community.

But families of choice also carry burdens. There is grief in realizing that one’s family of origin cannot or will not fulfill the traditional roles expected of them. There can be fear in depending on people who are not legally bound to stay. Financial and medical systems often fail to recognize chosen family members as legitimate decision-makers, denying hospital visitation or the right to emergency planning. Legal structures still privilege marriage, blood, or adoption in matters of inheritance and custody, despite growing calls for reform. As such, chosen families often operate in a legal and cultural gray area, where their emotional weight is undeniable, but their formal authority is limited.

Despite these challenges, research by Van Wormer and others underscores the long-term benefits of chosen families on mental health, social integration, and life satisfaction. A 2017 meta-review of non-biological support networks across demographic lines showed significant reductions in rates of depression, substance use relapse, and suicidal ideation among those with strong chosen family structures. These outcomes were most pronounced in individuals recovering from systemic or interpersonal violence, reinforcing the notion that families of choice do not merely offer emotional comfort; they literally save lives.

In the United States, cultural narratives around family are still deeply influenced by traditional images: the nuclear unit, the holiday dinner table, the generational homestead. Yet these images rarely reflect the complexity of modern life. Divorce, mobility, social upheaval, and economic inequality have all contributed to a reshaping of family life. According to a 2021 Pew Research Center study, over 40 percent of Americans report close emotional reliance on individuals outside their family of origin. The reality of chosen families is not fringe—it is fast becoming mainstream.

Communities have begun to catch up. Faith institutions, once rigid in defining family through marital or parental lenses, are increasingly offering “blessing ceremonies” for chosen kinship groups. Schools are beginning to ask for emergency contact lists that do not presume “mother” or “father.” Mutual aid networks, especially those born during the COVID-19 pandemic, exemplify the powerful ways people come together to meet one another’s basic needs, regardless of legal or biological connection. These shifts suggest an emerging ethic of care that reflects the values of chosen families: respect, flexibility, and enduring presence.

This emerging ethic can be felt most strongly in spaces where people have had to fight for belonging. While this article does not focus solely on the LGBTQ+ community, their centrality in the evolution of chosen family structures cannot be overstated. From the early days of the HIV/AIDS crisis—when families of origin often rejected gay men as they lay dying—to today’s gender-diverse youth seeking refuge in affirming households, queer communities have modeled what Van Wormer called “grassroots relational healing.” In these models, survival is not passive. It is collaborative, fierce, and deeply loving.

Yet, it is not only queer communities who benefit. Across racial, socioeconomic, and geographic lines, people are finding one another. Sometimes through 12-step meetings, sometimes through online support groups, sometimes through informal rituals like shared meals or holiday traditions that feel more authentic than the scripted performances back home. These moments do not replace grief, but they do reframe it. They remind us that we are allowed to choose joy, to choose safety, to choose each other.

Families of choice also challenge assumptions about care across the lifespan. In aging populations, particularly among those without children or with limited contact with relatives, friends often become lifelines. They coordinate medical care, provide emotional companionship, and offer dignity in death. Dr. Van Wormer emphasized the importance of “elder affinity circles”—peer-based care networks that mimic family without replicating its hierarchies. These circles reject the notion that aging equals isolation. Instead, they propose that the final chapters of life can be filled with connection and reciprocity, even if those connections are chosen rather than inherited.

Children, too, benefit from the expansion of what family means. Whether raised in multi-generational homes, foster settings, or by non-traditional guardians, children often form stable attachments to people who love them not because of biology, but because of commitment. Legal scholars and child development experts increasingly advocate for “psychological parenting” as a framework for custody and visitation decisions—an idea aligned with the values of families of choice. When courts and policymakers begin to recognize emotional and functional parenting as valid, they echo what Van Wormer and countless practitioners have long known: family is who shows up.

As we imagine a more just and compassionate society, the lessons of chosen families deserve center stage. They reveal that healing is possible. That connection is not limited by tradition. That love, when freely given and reciprocated, can build something sturdier than blood. In an era marked by disconnection and cultural anxiety, the quiet radicalism of saying, “You are mine, and I am yours, because we chose one another,” is nothing short of revolutionary.

The families we create are not just alternatives to something broken. They are blueprints for what could be. They are living evidence that love is more durable than pain, and that belonging is not a gift given by fate—it is a practice. A choice. A promise kept.

*And perhaps, most of all, they are a reminder that we are not alone.*

1kr5612,How To Cope? My life is great & my parents isn’t,ivyleaguebroke,"I’ve struggled my whole life in an extremely dysfunctional family. My family was always barely able to make ends meet, my parents marriage a disaster, and overall a lot of stress, overwhelm, and depression.

Fast forward to now, I’m an adult and I have the life I’ve always dreamed of. I have a great job and am able to do what I please/follow my dreams, but not enough to support them in anyway. My parents are still exactly where they are since I was a child: barely making it by. I struggle so much with this. Knowing how terrible and unhappy they are and how much they sacrificed to ensure I was able to get to where I am. Now here I am living my dream life and they are still struggling severely with finances, mental health, and everything else that goes with it. I know they wanted this for me, to be happy and live the life I dreamed, but it’s so hard to see them still like this. 

I guess my question is, how do I cope with this? It is the main thing I try to work through in therapy as it causes me deep sadness and likely the root of my depression, but I’d love to hear if anyone has similar experiences or can share any advice. It’s hard.

(all names are fictitious for privacy)
i live with my mom (40) and my older brother alex (20). the three of us have been together since i was about 8. one day dad just went out to get bread and never came back.
he left because of alex. not just because he was a ""difficult child"", it pains me to write this, but he really didn't know how to be a father to him. when alex was 9, he was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder. this is when a person can suddenly flare up for no reason. he would scream, break things, punch the wall, and then five minutes later be back to normal. it didn't happen every day, but when it did, it was scary.
mom took him to doctors, consultants, psychologists. she cried a lot then. and dad just... distanced himself. he pretended that everything was fine and didn't notice mom's condition, which was getting worse and worse. they were constantly arguing, dad would sometimes leave for the night, and come back drunk. one such evening, there was a big fight between my parents, after which dad packed his things and left (it's so unusual to write dad, because he was practically not present in my life) he never wrote or called me.
after that, mom changed. she stopped being just a mom. she became everything to alex: his support, nurse, psychotherapist, and protected him like he was a faberge egg. she said that she should be the one who ""will never betray"".
but now... i don't know.
she was always too caring, but lately it's strange. as if I don't exist at all. she calls him ""honey"", touches his face like he's still little. sometimes she just looks at him for too long.
i'm not saying anything happened. not yet. maybe it won't. maybe I'm just making it up.
but inside i feel like there's a stone. i feel anxious. and i've started noticing more and more little things that make my skin crawl.

if anything else happens, i'll write. i just needed to say it.",2,2,1747746926.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kr4lcp/i_suspect_my_mother_and_brother/

1kqzy0e,"I woke up during my wisdom tooth surgery and felt everything, but my mom is telling everyone that I’m making it up.",Salt-Ad-3061,"Hi everyone! I (21F) had my bottom two wisdom teeth removed last week. They were impacted (sideways and underneath my gum, pushing on my other teeth), so I had to have surgery to remove them. The surgery was about two weeks ago and because I was being placed under anesthesia, I had to have someone come with me to drive me home afterwards and my mom volunteered. My mom and I have always had a strained relationship, but she was my only option in this situation. Long story short (it would have to be a whole other post), I woke up multiple times during the surgery and could feel everything the dentist was doing. I also told the dentist I was awake and was sobbing in his chair. After the surgery, when they brought my mom in the room, I asked the dentist if anything weird happened, hoping he would explain to my mom I woke up (I tried to explain but it was hard to talk with gauze in my moth). He told her everything was perfectly normal and there were no issues. I wasn’t loopy at all afterwards so when we were in the car, I started telling her I woke up and could feel him cutting in my mouth. She kinda just brushed it off as me being loopy, because I sounded loopy due to all of the gauze in my mouth. A few hours later, I again brought up I could feel everything and she said I must have dreamt it. I’m 100% sure I woke up because I remember the pain, the dentist being annoyed I was crying, and slapping my hand away. 

I was just going to ignore it, but now she’s telling our entire family that I’m making it up. She’s convinced the whole thing was a dream but I was there and I know it wasn’t. It’s really bothering me how it feels like the situation is being ignored and I’m being gaslit into thinking I made it all up. Is there any way to get through to my mom and at least help her see how what she says is bothering me? I’ve flat out told her it upsets me but she’s still doing it so I don’t think I got my point across.

1kqxblx,My brother is ruining my family and i don’t know what to do,Glum-Function9561,"My family used to be a-lot of laughs and giggles and loving and fun. Until my brother began to have problems with are family. My brother is an extremely sensitive person has different political views than the rest of the family and thats perfectly fine, i know people can have their own opinions and i respect that i don’t look at him a different way for it, but ever since he got all political it’s ruined this family’s chemistry. He would say the most awful things to me and my parents saying we are essentially “Nazi’s” and that we kill people everyday with our decisions. Calling us racists, fascists, etc…
And this all came out of nowhere. As well as his extremely obsessive way to be sanitary. Which i don’t have a problem with either but when he’s washing his hands for 5 minutes at a time at the sink for 50 times a day it gets a little annoying, especially if you are trying to use the kitchen freely. And we’ve told him this “it’s not surgical, so you don’t need to wash your hands for 5 minutes okay.” And he’ll just respond to us saying that we are horrible people and putting thousands of lives at risk for being “unsanitary” Mind you me and my family have always been sanitary washing are hands often, but really? 5 MINUTES to wash your hands? It’s gotten to the point where both his hands are now bright red from how much he washes them. We try to tell him “you don’t need to wash your hands for that long okay” and he’ll just respond yet again like this “fuck you.” With the political side of things i’ve never been really involved with but i do know that i would say me and my family stray toward the center to right-winged on the political side of things. And my parents as well as i, DO NOT JUDGE anyone for having different opinions as us. But my brother can’t seem to understand that people ARE allowed to have their own opinions and views and this is where all the name calling and nasty stuff comes into play. I’ve heard the most foul shit come out of my brothers mouth to them and it drives me absolutely fucking insane! I would never disrespect my parents, my blood, my family over anything like this! Me and my parents have been dealing with this behavior for very long and i can tell that my parents are over it and they may be doing something about it soon.

1kqvu8j,My family turned on me after my mom passed. The love she had for me made them resent me more.,jsmrock10,"I’ve been sitting with something heavy, and I just need to let it out.

When my mom passed, I lost the one person who gave me unconditional love. She saw me fully. Loved me without conditions. And that bond—it was something my siblings noticed too. But instead of drawing us closer, it became the wedge.

Since she’s been gone, it’s like the rest of my family is… almost relieved. Like now that she’s not around to affirm me, they can finally isolate me without guilt.

My brother, who I thought I was rebuilding a relationship with, looked me in the face and told me I should “just be a great uncle” and “focus on being your best.” But behind my back, he’s been telling his kids not to contact me. I only found out because I went through his wife to see the kids—and the moment I did, they texted me joyfully like they missed me deeply. That moment broke me. Because it proved the love is real, but the gatekeeping is too.

What’s worse is that they act like I’m the one who turned my back on them. When the truth is—they’ve turned away from me and feel comfortable leaving me out. It’s as if they’re thriving in the silence. I keep replaying everything in my head wondering, what did I do to deserve this?

I trusted again. I opened my heart. I thought we were healing. But I was being used for gossip, not reconciliation. There’s no accountability. No honesty. Just silence, coldness, and manipulation.

I miss my mom more than I can explain. Not just because she was my mom—but because she was the only one who made me feel like I was safe and loved without conditions. Her passing didn’t just take her—it took the last thread of belonging I felt.

If anyone’s been through something like this—being turned on by your own family after a death, being resented for a love you didn’t ask to be special—how do you deal with it?

How do you grieve both a person and the version of family you thought you had?",4,1,1747713840.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kqvu8j/my_family_turned_on_me_after_my_mom_passed_the/
1kqvcbm,My sister is a psycho,NegotiationPlane5364,"I went shopping with her roommate, who is also my friend, and we bought some instant noodles at the market. My sister made my friend (her roommate) buy 2 large packs of instant noodles for her. It was around $15 and I know for a fact that she wasn't going to pay her roommate back because she never does and she constantly jokes about using her roommate for money. I felt bad for my friend but also ashamed bc our family always taught us to pay people back if we owed them money. When we got back to the dorm, I helped drop the groceries off and took one pack of my friend's noodles and traded her a pack of my instant noodles but just a different flavor. Before leaving, I lightly reminded my sister to remember to pay her back and she just laughed as if I was joking... I left and 10 minutes later I hear her screaming my name from her room. Mind you, this is a boarding school. All my fellow classmates and friends are in the same hallway as us. She was yelling my full government name without any shame and banging + kicking my door. I also have a roommate and we were genuinely scared for our lives. She was trying to break down my door and was threatening me at my door. She was hitting my door with her fists and acting like a psycho. People left their rooms just to watch her bang on my door and scream at me at my door. Crazy thing was, I didn't answer because I was scared she was going to harm me. After 10 minutes of not answering, she ran to the downstairs area of the dorm and started screaming my name and calling me names like, ""AMY YOU ARE SUCH A BITCH YOU FUCKING BITCH, OPEN UP U BITCH"". She went downstairs to scream this just to humiliate me. What she did was really embarrassing not only for her, but also for me. Honestly I'm glad I didn't open the door because if i did, she might have actually killed me. I actually think she has some sort of anger problem and could possibly be bipolar but I cant possibly address it to her or she's going to flip out and cause harm to me or the people around me.

1kqux37,I think my family is falling apart,MangaEveryTime,"I(21m) is the eldest of us three siblings with my sister being 16 and youngest being 1 years old. Our mother recently confided in us and told us about her worries regarding our father. About how he distances himself from us when in public, about how he has way too many company outings lately with pictures of no other associate being in the picture aside from himself, about how he has thick stacks of money in his bag but none of them used to help us pay bills, about how he cheated on her before when I was just 1 years old, about how he was hinting at having another woman in the form of a tasteless joke, he was also accusing our mom of cheating when she couldn't answer the phone because she was tending to our 7 month old sibling at the time.

I'm honestly sad, sad that the thought of our family breaking apart is just around the corner, things are just a blur for me at the moment, it's like I can't even see the thought of my future self, like my plans are crumbling along with my college degree in progress.

But, at the end of the day, me and my sister were never really close with him, he bought us things sure, but it was only out of obligation, I guess. I think it was pretty obvious this was gonna happen someday, considering my childhood was filled with a lot of hearing to my parents arguing and yelling. I just blinded myself to it because it was too much for me to handle. Tucked it all away in a place similar to Finn's vault.

Now, I just don't know what else there is for me to do. How do I help her? How can I become the bread winner of our family when he's gone? what does the man of the house do? Can I even carry the responsibilities that would come along with it? I'm still just a 2nd year college student, and I don't even know if we can pay my tuition till I graduate anymore.

TL;DR
We think our father is cheating because of how he's treating our family and because of him having far too many company outings with pictures of no other associate aside from himself. ",1,1,1747710788.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kqux37/i_think_my_family_is_falling_apart/
1kqunpt,Why did she stab me in the back???,MaterialMission1877,"I'm only asking this as curiosity.

Im 26 and I met a girl at work Named Mariana. She's 36 years old, married with 2 kids. I've known her for 2 years, and we worked in the same department.

She only worked twice a week as a secretary. we would talk at work whenever we saw each other.  We had so much chemistry and I began having feelings for her. We could talk about anything

I never said how I felt because I respect marriage, but I could tell she liked me as well. She would always stare at me, She would blush all the time. She would flirt with me, I was so happy seeing her

Some old ladies began making rumors about us, management told me to stop talking to Mariana to avoid drama. Mariana told my friend she missed talking to me, she begged my friend to NEVER tell me but Mariana was falling for me.

I'd avoid her when I saw her, but I'd always catch her staring at me.

She began getting in trouble for other issues at work....not about me

2 weeks later it was her birthday, and I gave her a gift card to her favorite cofee shop. She took it but she was acting strange,

She told manager about the card and I was suspended and moved to a different department. If I saw Mariana in the hallway she would look down at the floor to avoid me.

She even stopped talking to my friends

It was awkward, but she blocked me from everything.

Later She transfered to another building across the street.

I've told her numerous times that if she doesn't want to move we don't have to. She won't say no to the move tho and is just stuck on ""idk."" She says she wants to move cuz she knows we'll have a better life over there but just feels sad about leaving them behind.

1kqsdku,Family Drama - need advice,Throwaway_Chococat,"TL;DR: SIL tried to dump elderly father at our doorstep because of financial burden of his care. We declined and said we had no time or money to care for him - SIL insista we can clearly afford since we’re DINKs and have such a nice big house. SIL also demands we pay her to be caretaker for her dad.

Background

My husband Jack (48m) and I (38f) moved to the south (‘Murica) a couple years ago for work. His older brother lived here already, his younger sister “Sarah” stayed in CA where we’re all originally from. Their parents retired to Vegas. Covid hit and took their mom, deeply miss her still. While she was hospitalized, Jack and I would talk with them on the phone and throughout it all learned that his dad “Paul” wasn’t visiting her. Yes, Covid procedures affected this but he directly told us there was no point since she was dying. He basically wrote her off before she even passed away. Jack had arguments with his dad several times then and having his mom confirm she barely even got calls from him and she felt so lonely and disappointed in her husband caused  Jack to get angry enough that he decided to go no contact with dad. He absolutely will not forgive him for not trying harder in her final weeks. 

Fast forward a few months, we learn his sister Sarah has been taking care of their dad (she has legal POA personal and medical) and whatever else needed there since she only lives a 5 hour drive from LA to Vegas. She asked for help with gas so we send $150 by PayPal, stressing that Jack doesn’t want to be involved with his father directly, but will give her help if needed just to ask. Never heard again except for Sarah’s attempts to guilt Jack into repairing his relationship with his father. He got sick of her nagging about the same issue so he stopped taking her calls. She could still easily call me and we spoke at length when I was hospitalized in ‘23 for a ruptured appendix. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary between us, got along and chatted same as always. I would later also reach out by email just to say hi or sent her info I would get about job openings I thought she’d do great at since I knew she was looking to make a change and move out here closer to us. 

September 2024 she calls out of the blue only leaving a cryptic voicemail saying “please call”.  She answered immediately with no hello, instead just saying “congratulations, dad’s coming to live with you guys!” I panic and said absolutely not! I was not prepared to share at the time, but on top of my usual full time work I also was heading into my last semester at college, doing hospice for our elderly dog that had ALS, taking care of my elderly mom, AND starting the process of medical assessments that later diagnosed my breast cancer. I was nearing a burnt out panic attack and literally said so on the phone to her but she ignored me and ended the call.

Below are summaries of written conversation between us:

Sarah’s First Letter (September 18, 2024)
Sarah informed the family that their father would be visiting Jack and Paul Jr in Tennessee on a rotating basis. She provided care suggestions and demanded that they pay for high-speed internet and a video surveillance system at dad’s Vegas home, citing safety concerns and years of unpaid caregiving expenses. Sarah detailed her financial and emotional strain, stating she had carried the responsibility alone for years, and framed these demands as non-negotiable, warning that failure to comply could result in their father having to live with them instead.

My Response
I responded with empathy but clear boundaries, explaining that Jack and I were already financially and emotionally stretched due to caring for my mother with dementia. I stated we could not host or take on new expenses and suggested that Sarah consider subsidized senior care options in the west coast to reduce her burden.

Sarah Follow-Up (September 23, 2024)
Sarah replied that the visit was already scheduled for November 1st and not open for discussion. She dismissed my concerns, saying hosting their father would require little effort—just offering a spare room and an extra meal. She repeated her demands for the internet and security upgrades as urgent priorities.
Sarah also questioned my reaction to my own father’s death yrs ago, describing it as inappropriate or unemotional, and ended with a sarcastic suggestion that I send my mother back to California to ease my own burden.

My Reply
I again restated my boundary, confirming I could not host. I addressed Sarah’s financial claims, reminding her that no one is obligated to share their resources. I offered budgeting help as a professional courtesy (I’m an accountant) and acknowledged the emotional toll of caregiving, referencing medical research on “caregiver burden”. Stated I was willing to provide the little time off I had to work with her on her dad’s case for state/county benefits.
I expressed hurt over Sarah’s personal remark about my mom. I also clarified that grief looks different for everyone, defending myself against Sarah’s criticism of my reaction to my father’s death. I closed by encouraging respectful collaboration while emphasizing the need to work within legal authority.

Sarah’s Final Letter (September 30, 2024)
Sarah replied sarcastically, insisting that her financial struggles were entirely the result of unpaid caregiving. She introduced a formal monthly reimbursement demand totaling over $1,000 per person, covering her time, gas, and vehicle maintenance. She again reiterated the demand for internet and security upgrades and requested written clarification regarding a rumored threat of legal action for elder abandonment if she brought their father to visit.

No contact since all that, other than Sarah emailing me invoices charging me thousands to cover her missing work and travel expenses while caring for her dad. I ignored those. Recently (last week) I had my double mastectomy with reconstruction. I’m doing well with healing and husband Jack took several weeks of PTO to care for me, my mom, pets/house. I posted on my Facebook because that’s where my family and close friends can all be updated at the same time. She saw the post and called (I was about to be wheeled into surgery so sent her straight to voicemail), and texted. I later texted back just to say I made it through, all is going well as expected thank god. She wants to call and chat and be supportive like she used to be, as if the argument never happened. I can’t just forgive her after everything. Am I being a jerk? Should I accept an apology, assuming she wants to give one? What if she doesn’t apologize and just expects us to go back to normal? Mentioning that I’m ADHD and ASD, which she’s known about but I always got the feeling that she either didn’t understand or care what that is.

1kqrtz8,I'm seriously considering cutting off my family but I feel bad about missing weddings and funerals.,yummy_burrito,"  
TL:DR: My family has treated me like garbage my entire life and even my therapist has suggested majorly distancing myself from them.  They did not support me in university when I was struggling with my academics, illness, and finances (not even moral support, just said it was all my fault).  I rarely see them anyways but now I am ready to cut them off completely.  Two of my sisters are getting married this summer and one of them just had her (soon-to-be) mother-in-law pass away tragically.  I feel guilty about considering cutting them off but my mental health has gotten pretty bad and my family only exasperates it.   
  
The only way I can handle being around my family is if I take a good dose of antidepressants.  I really don't want to go down that spiral again but I'm wondering if just sucking it up and going to the weddings would be better in the long term. I (24 F) have always felt like the black sheep and the scapegoat in my family.  I am adopted and 3 of my siblings are also adopted.   There's nothing wrong with us but our family treats us like we are stupid failures (even though we are valedictorian types).  I think this is because our siblings are 7-20 years older than us.

My mom, my sisters and some of my brothers have treated me like garbage for as long as I can remember.   My mom disliked me in particular because I stood up for myself.  One sister that was only a year older than me began to imitate my mom and essentially bullied me my entire childhood.  One time my friends told me ""You always told me about things but I didn't fully get it until I saw it for myself"" after witnessing this sister harass and degrade me for no reason.  I tried to forgive my mom but my last straw was when my biological sister and I got abused by our brother and our mom first tried to downplay it (""I know that 17 year old boys are going through a lot of changes"") and then scolded us because our brother said we were lying and she believed him.  I always felt like my mom did not have my back and I was heartbroken to have that belief confirmed.  I used tell myself that I shouldn't end my life because I would ""escape"" once I was 18.  

Unfortunately the COVID hit in my first year of university so I ended up staying close to home.   I was riddled with anxiety and self-doubt at all times - especially whenever I was with my family.   My first and only boyfriend made me realize that I hated myself because of all the things my family said to me over the years.   \*Then I got sick\*.  LIKE REALLY SICK.  My family did not support me through my academic struggles, my illness, or my financial struggles while in university.  They would somehow find a way to say it was all my fault.   My mental health plummeted this year because of some medications my doctor gave me.  Plus I was speaking out against a mock slave auction that my faculty was hosting and faculty members were harassing me all year.  The dean was even fired because he threatened to suspend me when I did nothing wrong.   My family did not support me at all during this and one sister even told me to ""move on to bigger and better things"" when it got mentioned in the news. This sister and the one that bullied me are getting married and I have been dreading it since the day their weddings were announced.

Please help.",Novel-Library9484,"I’m 19, a B.Tech student, and the elder son in a broken Indian family. I live with my mother, my 16-year-old younger brother, and my grandmother who has leukemia. My parents are divorced, and after years of emotional trauma from my father, we live separately from him now. My father still exists—but he's the kind of man who turns a blind eye to everything, even when things are falling apart.

After the divorce, everything fell on my mother. She hates working but she took up a job anyway to make ends meet. Even during the summer holidays, she worked like hell just to feed us and keep the house running on her small ₹20,000/month salary. Despite all this, we’re barely surviving.

But for the past one year, my younger brother has turned into someone none of us recognize. He's 16, but he:

Drinks regularly (most nights of the week)

Smokes 4 cigarettes daily

Shouts and abuses our mother almost every single day

Emotionally blackmails her with “I’ll die”, “I’ll leave the house”, or “I’ll go live with dad”

Forces her into giving him money (for alcohol, cigarettes, roaming, etc.)

Manipulated her into buying him an iPhone 16 Pro worth ₹1.2 lakh — while our entire monthly income is just ₹20,000


She has started breaking down mentally. She can’t even sleep at night because he comes home late, drunk, and starts yelling or threatening suicide. I try to step in, talk to him, reason with him—but nothing changes. He either lashes out at me or manipulates her harder.

What’s worse is that relatives and neighbors have started blaming my mother—saying “she didn’t raise him right” or “she’s too soft”. Nobody blames my father, the man who should’ve been there to guide and correct his son. Instead, he just walks away from all of it, like it's not his problem.

I love my mother so much that I could give my life for her—but I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m still studying, not financially independent yet. I have no family member I can lean on. No father. No elder brother. Just me, watching my mother crumble more each day, and feeling helpless.

Please… any advice, any experience, any resource that can help me save my mother’s mental health—I’ll take it. I’m ready to act, I just don’t know what step to take next.

The prognosis right now isn’t good; but it’s been a rollercoaster between he’s on death’s door or there’s a chance he might pull through. 

My mother is acting as though he’s already dead, but is treating almost everyone around her like dirt. I understand stress and grief, but this to me is unacceptable. 

At the hospital, she argues with doctors and tries to get CNAs fired or in trouble if she feels they aren’t doing their jobs. 

She says my husband and I aren’t obligated to stay over her house and take care of things, but if there’s something in our life we need to take care of, or just need a mental health break; she becomes histrionic, passive aggressive, and nasty; saying how nothing matters, how she’s all alone, etc. She acts envious at times as well. 

When my husband is around, she thanks him profusely for his kindness and says nothing to me, even though I’ve helped around the house, too. 

When it’s just her and I, she again becomes histrionic, saying she’s all alone, and that after everything she’s done for me I owe her. She also says the only reason my father isn’t dead is because I haven’t gone to see him. 

How can I do that when I’m at her house minding the dog, doing laundry, and making sure there’s food to eat? 

She will also make random snide remarks or comments toward me whenever my husband isn’t around. 

I cannot drive and if my husband is at work and she is at the hospital, I have no means of transportation. I have a part time job on weekends, and she holds that against me, too. 

Both of my parents are narcissists and have had a pattern of these behaviors all of my life, and my father, long before this, told me directly to my face that he never wanted me. 

My mother made and continues to make excuses for him; his past, his mistakes he’s made. And she denied that he meant what he said when I told her the day it happened. She insisted that nothing was wrong then, and still doesn’t now. She claims he told her once that I was his “pride and joy.”

I can’t feel any emotional connection toward either of them because of this, and I just want to set boundaries and distance myself. My husband disagrees, saying that I’m not being empathetic enough toward them and should cut my mother some slack. I’m pretty sure he’s basing that on how he’s being treated. 

All of this is really doing a number on my mental health. I feel alone and trapped. 

TL;DR: My toxic mother is making my father’s journey toward his passing a nightmare, is treating me like dirt, and I want to distance myself; my husband disagrees.

1kqn6rz,Insanity?,PatternIll,"Ok so I (50F) live with my mother (80f) to help her out as she is a widow and doesn’t like to be alone in the house. I am an only child. I also work 50+ hours a week at a physical job. It’s exhausting. Mom is physically active and has zero health issues. 

She lives in the top two floors of the house, having the main kitchen, 2 1/2 bathrooms, 3 bedrooms, living room and dining room full of only her things. Me and my husband (56m) live in the basement apartment. She complains we have “too much stuff” but in reality we are minimalists, having only small amounts of items and only what we need. Mom and I bought this house together, so it’s not like one of us moved into the other one’s space. 

Mom has lots of friends and makes them easily. Hubby and I are not social and are perfectly fine living this way. 

So what’s the issue? 

I think my mother is a narcissist. She’s also a perfectionist. Cleans things that don’t need cleaning. I don’t leave my own shoes at the front door out of fear, even though my shoe rack is there with 6-8 pairs of her shoes. I can’t park in the garage even when she is away. Can’t use the kitchen. Can’t leave a thing out of place if I sneak in to bake something. 

We have lived this way for 18 months and I’m ready to scream. I’m on anxiety meds. I hide a lot to avoid her. I bite my tongue a lot. Speaking up only creates more drama. Her tone when speaking to me is demeaning and borders on rude. Anything I say is wrong and she lets me know it in no uncertainty. Nothing I do is good enough. She believes my diabetes isn’t real because she claims to have it too and her sugars are always fine (she doesn’t have it) also we don’t eat together because of my shifts so I don’t know why that matters to her? I supply our own groceries downstairs so it’s not that my dietary needs cost her anything. And no, we don’t have a kitchen, we use air fryer, outside bbq and a plug in element for cooking) Also, in her opinion, I’m too gray haired, (it’s also too long for my age) and I’m too overweight. Just never good enough. 

I remember my late father being very quiet around her. Saying “yes dear” a lot while rolling his eyes. And also hiding away for hours. Maybe he felt the same way? I left home at 17 and now remember why. I thought it would be different now that I have 5 decades of life experience. It’s worse. 

My grown children 22m and 25m barely communicate with her because they see how she acts towards me. My boys are fiercely protective of me and know I’m soft. They stopped talking to her completely after Christmas dinner when she started up a conversation about “killing” my  elderly dog (despite my calm protest that this was not the time or place for that conversation) because he was leaving fur all over the house. (We had to put him down in April due to genuine health concerns. He was 15 1/2.) but the boys lost the last of their respect for gramma in that moment. I only see my kids when she is not home or we go out somewhere else. 

So should I leave? Start fighting back? 

Hubby is stuck in the middle but is frustrated too. I don’t want this to be a marriage killer. We are solid now but I don’t need this to eat away at us. 

I just have zero ambition anymore. Like she has taken away every ounce of positivity that I once had. This is not the life I want.

1. Don't text my kid about this stuff
2. State exactly what you want in the first message so I can decide for myself if it's something that I need to respond to. Stop with this cryptic ""it's an emergency but I won't say what it is until you call me"" BS

1kqkfnh,Am I wrong for refusing to play with my 6 years old little brother?,Ready_Entertainer_10,"Hello! I'm not American, and maybe my English isn't the best, but I need someone to tell me some truths, for better or worse. Two months ago, my parents decided to take my little brother, who just turned 6, out of school. This is not illegal in my country, children up to a certain age can go to homeschooling. The thing is, they decided to do this because of an irrational fear that he would be indoctrinated with gender ideology and communism in kindergarten. When they decided to do this, I was against it because he doesn't know many children, and he is a very socially skilled boy. Here at home, we are a family of 5. My parents are both over 40, I am 20, my youngest brother who turned 6 last week (let's call him ""Lucas"") and my middle brother, who is 18.



Lucas only knows 3 cousins ​​and the neighbor's daughter who are about his age, and he sees them every other weekend when they go out to play. He misses other children, and wants to play with someone 24 hours a day.

The problem is that I am now in a public college, with a scholarship, and I am studying Computer Science. My course is full-time, from 7:00 to 18:30 some days. On the few days that I am home full-time (I still live at my parents' house), Lucas wants to play with me full-time. I used to play with him more, but now I don't play for more than half an hour a day. Whenever he asks me to play more than that, I refuse, making up an excuse like ""I have to do my homework"" or ""not now, I'm resting"". And I go back to playing on my laptop. My parents want me and my middle brother, let's call him ""Gabriel"", to become Lucas's social life, to make up for the lack of friends his own age, and they say things like ""you love this game more than your brother!"" I feel bad about refusing to play with him, especially since he's lonely, but I'm getting ready to leave home for a few other reasons, and I don't want him to miss me too much, so I'm trying to create some distance because he's very attached to me. Plus, my parents want to deny the obvious consequence of not allowing Lucas to go to school, and I feel like fulfilling their wishes and being close to Lucas is somehow supporting their decision to isolate him from the other kids.

He’s with her every weekend, takes her on trips and even told her he loves her. The part that also really disgusts me is that she is 25 years old.. My mom has no idea.

It’s devastating. My mom gave up everything to move to another country for him — her job, her whole life in the U.S. — and now she works a low-paying job while he’s living a double life. And the worst part is, he thinks we don’t know.

I don’t have a very close relationship with my dad, and this makes it even harder. But my sister and I have already decided we’re going to tell my mom.

I do want her to divorce him. I know it’s going to hurt, but she deserves better. She made huge sacrifices for his career and our family, and I truly believe she can get financial support through a lawyer. The house, cars, and a lot of the assets are in her name. I think she’ll be okay in the long run — I just want her to know she has options and she’s not stuck.

If anyone’s been through something like this… how do you tell someone the truth when it could break their heart, but maybe also set them free?

Update: I spoke to a lawyer today who explained that since my dad is the main provider and my mom has a modest job but lives well because of him, she could receive good alimony in a divorce.

1kqi6s4,Parents potentially divorcing & Mom wants to move into my guest room,Narrow_Garden_9284,"On mothers day my mom informed me she wants to divorce my dad. They are going to a couples therapy retreat over the weekend but mom admitted she doesn't want to go anymore and doesn't feel open to resolving the issues, she's basically set her mind to being done. My dad on the other hand is very much not done. I've learned through speaking with them and my siblings that dad has even taken the steps to work on himself per mom's request through therapy. However my mom is not doing the same.. 

I come to reddit for advice on this - since the revelation of her impending divorce filing she has asked if she could move into my spare bedroom ""if things go poorly."" I spoke with my husband and we initially agreed a few months would be fine given my mom has never had to support herself and does not have the means to live on her own. At dinner this past weekend she made an offhand comment about going back to school and staying with us for the duration (2 years minimum for the associates degree she's looking at - 3 yrs likely while she saves up in her first year post graduation). I let the comment go because we were in a noisy restaurant and I wanted to discuss this in depth with my husband and siblings before approaching my mom about it. My husband I have agreed that if she is going to live with us long term we will set the expectation that she will go to actual therapy. Currently, she is watching YouTube videos and is a member of a divorcee Facebook group that she feels is sufficient. Is that an overstep requirement? At this point I do not intend to charge much for room rent, maybe $100-150 plus 1/3 of the utilities and I am willing to work with her on that if she needs that money to pay for the therapy. Ultimately, she claims multiple issues such as ptsd and severe anxiety and depression and pins it all on my dad. If she truly feels she needs to divorce him for her happiness that is fine, I am not a member of their marriage and do not wish to be involved in that, but I don't think a divorce will heal her or magically solve her problems and I don't want to fall into patterns of bitterness we had the last time we lived with each other*. 

Another point of concern for me is that my marriage is young, we've been married barely 6 months, and while my husband is extremely supportive and loves my parents, I am worried this will put undue strain on him and our relationship. He is also currently going back to school and will be a student for the next two years. His major concern is that this will cause us more financial strain and will put too much on my own mental well-being (see my own tumultuous history with mom*) - what other boundaries should we set to ensure that we can cohabitate peacefully if she does live with us for an extended time?

**Further history on my relationship with my mom - growing up with her i was bitter and angry with her most of the time, I am the eldest daughter and because she has narcissistic tendencies, little tact and honestly (back then especially) she had no empathy, we were just unable to communicate with eachother and it caused a lot of hurt feelings. Since growing up and moving out I've made my peace with who she is and have been redeveloping our relationship, I am now also the only child who lives close to her which is why she is asking this of me. 


Tl;dr - is it fair to require my soon to be divorced mother to be actively in therapy if she wants to live in my spare bedroom full time? What other boundaries and expectations should we set for my husband and my sanity? ",1,5,1747677022.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kqi6s4/parents_potentially_divorcing_mom_wants_to_move/
1kqi44b,Middle child syndrome : a rant,Famous-Fox8489,"Being a middle child is weird. 

Its like you only exist when people need something from you. Other than that, you are seen but never really felt. 

I was talking with my sister about a holiday that my dad is going on. Apparently my dad wanted either my eldest sister or my youngest sister to come with him. When my youngest sister asked about me, he was apparently like ""we'll see about her"". 

It's strange because just yesterday he was talking to me about his childhood. I can't lie it seems like my parents are never interested in what I do unless it concerns them directly (for context, I study law). 

I have been feeling like this for the last 24 years. Even my sisters are a bit weird with me. My eldest jokes but  doesn't deeply talk to me until she needs someone to rant to. My youngest sister makes these really weird remarks sometimes about me (like once she was describing how the furniture suits me in that the furniture was meek, feeble). My youngest sister even asked for my oldest sister's snap while I was there. And there were instances where my youngest was like oh (the oldest) favourited me in her contacts guess we know who is the favorite sister. 

My dad clearly has the eldest as his favourite because she is specializing in what he does. My mom pretends she doesn't discriminate but it feels like she is closest with my youngest. Then there is just....me.... I can't help but feel.sometimes there is something really deeply wrong with me. 

I try to show that it doesn't get to me. But sometimes it really really fucking hurts. I was wondering whether any other middle children feel the same

1kqfsvc,My brother and I used to be best friends — now he won’t talk to me because of my husband. What do I do?,alyssa505o4,"
Growing up, my younger brother and I were super close…best friends, really. We leaned on each other a lot, especially since we had a semi-narcissistic mother and an enabling father. We understood each other in a way no one else did. But everything changed three years ago when I started dating my now-husband.

Backstory: My brother got into some trouble in high school — got mixed up with a bad crowd, experimented with hard drugs, and even ran away for a week to a party house. Despite all that, he always kept in touch with me. He even encouraged me to move in with my then-boyfriend. But then, one of his friends (who had literally just been at our house) got arrested for stabbing someone while high on coke. He was 18 and went to jail for it. 

Naturally, my boyfriend was concerned and told me to be cautious around my brother’s friends. When my brother later asked what my boyfriend thought about his “homie getting locked up,” and I relayed that he told me to be careful, my brother blew up saying that it meant my boyfriend didn’t trust him to protect me. Honestly, I just chalked it up to him being an immature 18 year old who would get over it. 

BUT since then, it’s like he’s disowned me. In the last three years, except for when I text him to say I love him, he’s only actually talked to me twice: once to come by when my husband was out so I could help with a job application, and once to defend our mom in a ridiculous argument where she was mad I texted “love you” instead of “I love you.” My parents and I have had several big fights but we always end up okay… my brother had never defended her to me before though.  

What really hurt is how he talks badly about my husband to family, all based on that one cautionary comment from years ago. I honestly thought our relationship might improve around the time of the wedding. When I texted to ask if he would come, I got a oddly formal reply that he would come with his girlfriend. Honestly felt like she was texting me, not him (I used to tutor him. I know he doesn’t write like that).

And then… he just didn’t show up. On my wedding day. Turns out he was moving out of my parents’ house that day, and my dad even left our reception early to help him.

I am so upset. It’s been three years! I’m heartbroken, confused, and don’t know how to move forward. I miss my brother, but I’m tired of being hurt by his silence and passive-aggressiveness. Is there a way to rebuild this, or should I accept that he’s choosing to stay distant? Any advice is welcome.

1kqfmcr,my family will disown me if i stay with my boyfriend who is of another race.,Honest_Republic5420,"I (22F) grew up in an extremely traditional European family. Family value matters and so does your reputation. Well, it's 2025 and I live in America. So, while I do respect those values, I don't necessarily agree with living your life for others. I met this boy in high school. We'll name him Frank. Frank and I were best friends in high school. We then started to grow feelings for each other, and the rest is history. Frank is a kind, loving man who not only respects me, but we share the same religious beliefs and has given me new perspectives on the lord and his teachings. Which, in my opinion, is very rare nowadays. I see myself spending the rest of my life with him and one day raising a family with him.

The only issue is, he is not of our culture. I've had to hide this relationship for years because I know my family would never accept. And Frank knew this, but he was willing to risk it with me. Just recently, my sister confronted me about this and said that she knows everything. At first, I had no idea what she was talking about until she mentioned a boyfriend. I tried to deny it at first, but then she told me she had proof. She had his name, city he lived in, social media, even went as far as finding out that money was being sent through apply pay on iMessage. I have my own bank account. I have no idea how she found these transactions in the first place. I was fuming. We were going back and forth; she was telling me to break up with him because I am hurting my entire family by dating this man, calling me every name in the book. I basically said to stay out of my business and stay out of my life. She then said she was going to tell our mom everything and expose everything. I flipped out. Once we got home, I ran downstairs to get my backpack with some of my belongings. And as I'm doing that, she's telling my mom everything.

I grabbed my keys and ran so fast out of the house. My mom tried dragging me back inside and my backpack fell off of my back and I just bucked it for my car. I get in, and I lock all the doors, beginning to back out. But my mom and my sister are both on each end of my car trying to open my doors. My sister banging her body trying to break my window open, and my mom trying to open my passenger door. They would not budge. I wanted to leave so bad, but I couldn't leave without my license and all my credit/debit cards. So, I stupidly pulled back in my driveway and went to grab my bag. It was already too late to leave as my mom took my keys from my hand. My car is not under my name, so unfortunately, she has the right to take the car from me.

We go inside, and it's world war three. My mom believed everything my sister told her. I couldn't get a word inch edge wise. Had no chance to tell my story. It was straight name calling, hitting, screaming, you name it. My mom also threatened me to break up with him and I can't even say the rest of what she said because of how severe it got. My mom then balled her eyes out. A gut wrenching scream came out and she basically said that I am hurting all my sisters, my uncles, my aunts, and I will kill my grandparents over this. I hated seeing my mom that way and what she was saying hurt me so bad. But all I kept thinking was, what about MY happiness? What about MY hurt I'm being put through? It made me feel like their love for me is only conditional. That they will only love me and accept me if I follow their way of living.

In regard to my relationship with my mom, we've always had a rocky relationship. In my early teenage years, we fought all the time. She would say awful things to me and involve my uncles in situations (because I don't necessarily have a strong father figure in my life) and would basically pin everyone against me. As far as my older sister, she always snitched on me growing up. And I never really trusted telling her things about my personal life. Our relationship grew (I thought) and we became a little closer once we hit our 20's. Now, I know she's never changed.

My mom sits in my room next to me as she calls me names, puts her hands on me, all for about two hours while I'm balling my eyes out, crying to God to save me. Every time I moved my phone, she would think I'm recording her (surely because she's afraid of the police getting involved because what she's doing is NOT OKAY.) but I wasn't. She then called my uncle. And I almost shit my pants. My mom tells my uncle the situation and he takes me to this parking lot to talk. Saying the same thing my mom said. But his voice started to raise so I didn't say a thing. He's saying how devastated my mom is and that I'm breaking everyone's hearts. He tells me to breakup with this person or else he will get involved. He then kept saying that he's probably cheating on me and doesn't actually love me. I didn't say a word. Because anything I said was useless to everyone. Essentially, our relationship is tarnished because of this whole thing. Which, I've come to terms to. But it also hurts.

Since my mom took my keys, I had to uber to work because no one else was willing to take me to work (Frank works.). I'm sure my mom wanted me to call off so she can continue torturing me again, but I've had enough. I have a life outside of my home. I love all my sisters and my family. I do. And my intention was never to hurt them. But I also want to be able to live my life and figure out myself. I want to be happy with the person I love. If I listened to everything they wanted me to, I would be miserable and I know I wouldn't be able to be my true self. It breaks my heart that my family may never talk to me again. That my family may never see my children one day, that I'll be missing out on big milestones. I'm extremely depressed over it and i can barely eat, sleep, or drink anything. But I know myself, and I've been wanting to leave my house many years, even before I met Frank. Living there is not good for my mental health and I almost feel like it will only get worse from here on out by living there.",1,12,1747671024.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kqfmcr/my_family_will_disown_me_if_i_stay_with_my/

1kqc1jn,How do I protect my nephew in Roblox,kidmarsl,"First of all, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit in this r/. I've never played Roblox and I'm not interested in it. That is why I'm afraid my nephew is destroying his childhood by being to innocent and stepping into traps like these condos.

I recently watched the video-essays from shinzu surrounding the condos and stuff. Kinda goin into a rabbit hole rn, so my nephew doesn't have to when it's too late.

Is there something like a ""blacklist"" for specific ""RP"" Roblox games that are condos in disguise somebody can share? I'm his youngest uncle (im 21) and therefore the most aware person he has, when it comes to online security and stuff (f.e. I told him to stop watching short content because I don't want his attention span to crumble that young).

My nephew is 6 yrs old and I'm very afraid for his childhood. I usually never post anything on Reddit which is why I'm doing my best to explain myself. Pls believe me, I'm not a PDF, I don't want intel on which condos are still active to get what I want or shit like that. I just wanna protect my nephew and I'm not used to post on Reddit, so I wanna proof my innocence somehow and define that I'm serious about this.

TLDR: I (M21), want to protect my nephew (6) from Roblox condos and need a blacklist or some kind of a list of red flags that I should look out for.

1kq773q,18F- MY 59M Father cheated with his 50F blood relative and she keeps disturbing me and my family.,jam_jam_907,"I'm an 18F from a South Asian family. I have a brother who's 4 years older than me. My dad is 59M, my aunt (let’s call her Lisa) is 50F. Lisa is a blood relative, not my dad’s sister, and has two kids and a husband (who also cheats, by the way).

Growing up, we were very close  more like one big family. I literally don't remember a time I wasn't close with her. We shared everything.

But things started getting weird in late 2021. My dad slowly began disrespecting my mom  mocking her, blaming her for things, etc. We were confused because he used to be this religious, respected man in the community. My parents had no obvious issues before this.

In early 2022, both families were hanging out at our house. My dad and Lisa’s husband were in another room. While everyone else was chilling, I noticed Lisa texting my dad on WhatsApp — something like “Did you eat?” but using casual language, no honorifics, which in our culture is extremely weird when addressing someone older.

I got suspicious. My brother checked later using an app that recovers deleted messages — and yeah, what we found confirmed a lot. I won't go into too much detail, but the messages between them were very inappropriate.

We confronted our dad and told him we didn’t want contact with her anymore. He didn’t care. Lisa, being the kind of person she is, started crying and acting like a victim. She’s good at that.

Since then, she has been calling me and my brother using different numbers, swearing at us, saying horrible things about my father (even though she’s with him?!), and doing this especially during our exams to mess with us. One time she even called using my dad’s phone.

It’s been years. My mom is mentally breaking down from this. My brother keeps saying we should “stay silent” for the sake of reputation. But I’m done. I'm sick of being the one protecting everyone's peace while nobody protects ours.

Recently, I tried to reach out to her daughter (Lisa won’t let her talk to me), so I told a relative (kind of her daughter’s boyfriend — long story) about everything. My family says I shouldn't have done that — but I was silent for years. My brother wont do anything.  My mom is getting fucked up she's now fully mentally unstable 

My father continues to act like nothing’s wrong. No one holds him accountable. Everyone is worried about his reputation in society.

1kq6n92,Is it possible to live happily without parents after Marriage?,Worldly_Poem_2157,"For context: I am an Indian Male (Age: 29). 
Indian parents tend to have a lot more involvement and control on their children's life after marriage. 

My story: 
Recently married, everything is ok between me and my wife. We do have minor conflicts, but sort them out quickly. My parents don't live with us but visit regularly. They seem to be unhappy with my wife. Before marriage they were happy and excited, but after marriage looks like their expectations are not met. They have a very orthodox thinking. I always wanted my wife and my parents to live happily with each other. Recently we had multiple conflicts and fights related to petty issues related to my wife (My parents and me) I did not disrespect them, only tried to explain to them that we both are happy together and it will be best if they just let us be. They love me a lot but can't seem to understand this simple thing. They think that I am disrespecting them. And the issues are not any major issues, minor things which are not even worth mentioning. I have been thinking a lot about these things recently. I have decided that going forward I will take my wife's stand but won't discuss anything with them. I will maintain my separate son-parents relationship with them and keep the husband-wife relationship with my wife unaffected. My dad will retire from his job in a couple of years and after that they might come live with us, but now, I think it's not a good Idea. Hope things settle down till then, but let's see.
I am the only child, and it just feels a little sad to know that things are not as expected. I love my parents and will respect them always, but can't let them destroy my marriage. 
I have tried talking to them multiple times with no use. I think keeping distance from conflicting topics is the way forward. Me and my wife will live our life peacefully and they will also be happy in their own life.

1kq5zm3,"Question/Advice: Younger Brother (34M) is ""competing"" with me (36F)",lateralus142857,"Tl;Dr younger brother has been at odds with me since early 20s. He stated ""you think you're better than everyone- whenever u visit, you think you're the shit"" due to me visiting our mom while I've been traveling/sight seeing for a few years. Come 15ish yrs later, he picks a fight with me by him viewing my social media via sending an unsolicited DM mocking whatever it is I'm doing/sharing. What do I do? Ive blocked him before for being disrespectful towards me/let things go, but now it's happening more frequently. What do I do? We don't live together- our mom wants us all to get alone ie for ceremonies, events, and I'm very cordial during these times. He's attempted to cause discourse (recently at Thanksgiving '24* dinner) to which I avoided luckily.

Long story, and I may come back and edit bc it's late. Back in 2012/13 I found out my brother pushed our mom, and she told me while I was visiting. I confronted him privately about it, and how that it wasn't right, etc and that's when he unleashed a lot of stuff on me I hadn't a clue he's been harboring toward me. I believe he's forced himself to believe it over the years to bail out of accountability for putting hands on mother.... So for the next 15/16yrs, he's had it out for me. I've also on my end, didn't invite him to my children's birthday party. My reasoning (cons) outweighed the pros: mostly schoolmates of my child's school, large age gap bw his son and my daughter (5yrs), it was a girl's themed party, with parents from her school I wanted to make a first good impression with (my brother made me uneasy during a hosted thanksgiving by my little family back in '22, by shouting at me for asking/telling his son (9yo at the time) to help tidy play area where all cousins were cleaning*) ""my son's a guest in your home, he shouldn't have to help do anything"" in front of my in-laws and ext guests/ while also attempting to bait my in-laws side of fam into political discourse (trump). So for birthday party come three years later, I decided it was best not to invite him. He called a week after the party was had and asked if I was having a party, I said it has already came and gone, and he flipped out on me (all via text) which I encouraged him to call me instead, to which he refused. 

I'm at a loss of where to go with him (we live 30mins from each other). I have a large family (family of 5, expecting for a family of 6 come Aug*), and he is a family of 2 (himself and son (12yo)). It takes a lot (physically/emotionally/mentally) to plan outings with my family, and I don't get out much. When I do, and post snapshots of it on Instagram, here he comes in my DMs attempting to put my endeavors down/or comparing.

I do hold resentment toward him for things he's said to me, red flags, generally, and so badly just want to minimize interaction with him. But I can't completely block him, since my family /older brother (41M), and sister (37F)/ and their children, and my mom, want everyone together, for big events. For ex, we have one coming up and it's for the eldest first grandchild nephew graduating high school ceremony, and everyone is showing up! My mom and sister don't speak to each other, havent for almost 6 years now, so it's all uncomfy. 

I try to be best version of myself and on my best behavior, and really just be a good example for my children and even make it enjoyable for my fiance to be around my somewhat emotionally-dysfunctional family--- at the ceremony, my older brother rented out a whole Mexican restaurant for my nephew's celebration- it's going to be a long night, and I plan on leaving/departing ceremony around 8pm, to avoid any late night mental drunken shenanigans my family can get into.

Overall, I know I should have a heart to heart with my younger brother, and remind him that I do love him, etc. (which I have before in his rougher times that he was vulnerable w me), and I have reached out to him prior before.... I guess I'm tired of doing that/nurturing men at their big age? Instead of seeking therapy (I'm not a therapist* and I have my own issues).

1kq3et3,36F clarity giver oon marriage in late 30s for men,blissbond,"Let me start by telling you story of my boss who retired at 60 last month.
Gem of person and no complains whatsoever about him as junior. This is about his family life. As on the date of retirement 
his wife is around 55, 
has son who is in 9th standard( age around 15 yrs)  
daughter just finished her graduation age around 25 yrs.
He told that he married late . 
So after basic back calculation I could conclude that he might have married at aroud 33. 
One day during discussion he mentioned that he can not afford to mentally retire as he has to do lot of work even now on family front. This conservation got me thinking about following
1. His Daughter is yet to be married. Lets me realistic, as father its major financial committment. He doesnt have pension so everything has to be done from his lumpsum corpus he received on retirement.
2. Son is yet to finish school. Expenses of his college education again have to be drawn from lumpsum corpus.
3. His wife is home maker so he has to take care of all these financial obligations. 
4. His daughter started working and i think she ll be ready to help him out. But i know him as person, he wont accept it. 

Now i realised why my father wanted me to get married before his retirement. 
This is all the financial aspect of situation.
Now lets think about emotional aspect of it.
1. Kids of almost 95% of his peers are settled in conventional sense like finished education and married at least. So there is peer pressure .
2. His peers are enjoying quiet peaceful life and he has to still keep up with wordly affairs.
3. By the time his son finishes his college he will be 65. So next 5 years are very crutial for him.
4. By the time his son marries and he has grand kids(if his chooses to) he will be 70. 
So after working for 36 yrs of life earning money for family, he has to work 10 more years so that his children no longer need him in conventional sense.
5. If they get some health issues, his children will have to look after them, when they themselves have their young  kids to take care.
6. I visited their home and his wife is still on her toes to take care of their teenage son. She is also 55, so mostly will be facing menopause related health challenges.
7. As mother myself,  i could understand how concern she is for her son. Taking care of teenagers is toughest of all when you are dealing with your own health issues too.
Lets be realistic settling children down is considered fathers responsibility till date and men feel sense of failure if it doesnt happen. 

So whole point of this story is 
"" Did my boss understand repurcussions of his decisions to marry and have kids late ?"" 
Most probably NO.
He had government job which was relatively less stressful and secured compared to jobs these days. So he could work till 60. 
Most of today's jobs are not alike . 
With life catching up, i cant see myself working in conventional job till 60. I feel like I am done when I am only 36. I guess many people of my generation will agree with me. 

Other day i wrote post about women's marriage in late 30's. Where i mostly wrote about physical aspect of it. For men of course, there is issue of deriorating sperm quality.
But in my opinion for men ""mental effects"" outweight physical.

I read many posts of ppl complaining that their parents are forcing them to get married as they reach 30. They are resorting to emotional blackmail than telling their adult kids about actual practical aspects. 
Its true that its impossible for a 30 yr old man or woman to portrait himself/herself as 70 yr old. But when we look back, time flies and we get old sooner than we realise. Financial security is also important when taking decision to marry and have kids. But i guess life is all about balance. You just cant have it all. You will have to take  your decisions based on probabilities.
Purpose of this post is not to tell men or women to marry early. Its just to let you all know consequences of decisions made today. Your decisions have far fetched effects on mental,emotional and financial wellbeing of you and your future kids.

So plz just be aware.

1kq0e6a,Called an addict while taking prescribed meds—by relatives who’ve abandoned their own kids.,New_Assistance8703,"I’m a full-time working mom of three, two of whom have serious medical conditions. I just completed my college degree after ten years of grinding through school while raising them—often without help. I’ve never had grandparents raising my kids, no spouse carrying the full load, no trust fund or safety net. Just me, doing my best to survive and show up every day.

While visiting my grandmother in the hospital today—vulnerable, exhausted, and emotionally raw (I'm also experiencing a pregnancy loss my aunt knows about, but my uncle doesn’t)—they ambushed me and accused me of being an “addict.” Not because I’ve done anything wrong, but because I take medication exactly as prescribed by a board-certified psychiatrist with over 25 years of experience at a top mental health institution.

They tried to disguise it as love. But it didn’t feel like concern. It felt like retribution—for not letting them control the narrative, for including people they’ve written off, and for daring to put my grandmother’s peace above their comfort. At one point, my uncle even put his hand on my shoulder while I was crying—doing his fake, nonstop eye contact routine like he cared—which felt more like intimidation—and told me I shouldn’t be trying to help others reconnect because my life is a mess and my family is dysfunctional.

As if that justifies cutting people off. As if having a hard season in my own life disqualifies me from giving my grandmother a chance to see people she loves before it’s too late. Here’s the part that stings the most: the hypocrisy. My uncle didn’t raise most of his kids. He’s only just started showing up for his fifth child—and even now, the child’s maternal grandmother carries most of the weight.

My aunt left her first son for five years while she was in jail and hasn’t worked in nearly two decades. Her husband raised their son from age 2 to 8 alone and has handled nearly every household and childcare duty—even after their second son was in school full-time. She spent years isolated in bed with every window covered, chain-smoking indoors. Their house has black mold in the basement that she refuses to remediate. One son ended up hospitalized with seizures due to extreme potassium and nutritional deficiencies after surviving on nothing but chips, soda, and peanut butter crackers.

And my uncle? He depended on his mother until his mid-30s because of addiction. He stole from her repeatedly until it drove her into a nervous breakdown—right before she was diagnosed with Stage 4 bone cancer, which she’s now been battling for six years. Neither of them has gone to college. Neither has worked full-time while parenting alone. Neither has carried the kind of mental, emotional, and financial load I have—without breaks, without relief, and without inherited help.

Yeah, I’m burned out. But I’ve never walked away from my kids. I’ve never stopped showing up. I’ve stayed afloat without the handouts or shortcuts they’ve relied on. I bought a home by myself at 26. I’ve kept a job, raised three kids, finished school, and built a life for them that no one built for me.

I’ve done everything I could to stay stable, seek help, follow medical guidance, and hold my life together—even when no one else was holding it together for me. So when I get accused of being an addict—for simply surviving—it’s not just wrong. It’s gaslighting. And honestly? It feels like jealousy in disguise.

I asked her where he got such information. She said these days you can access any person's background by entering their name. The therapist said she should cut contact. 
To start out, my husband has a very common first and last name and when I looked where she said the therapist found the information there were 6 with even the same middle initial. Including my husband's biological father. I put in my husband's other personal information. As expected, no jail time or even a ticket. I did know his mom had left with my husband and his siblings when they were 3, 5, and almost 7 because of his drinking. She remarried a year later. I then checked out his father, same name except his middle name was John not James and of course 23 yrs older. Everything under his records matched what the therapist was telling our daughter but saying it was her father. After finding out this I tried to contact her to let her know it wasn't her dad's information the therapist got but her biological grandfather I have not even met. I also talked to my husband's sisters. My daughter's either changed her number or has us blocked. I of course don't know the therapist's name. I actually talked to a local therapist from our church and he said that is not something they really can do at least in our state. I really don't blame her for being upset if that is what he told her, but we have been married nearing 40 yrs as well as haven't lived anywhere near any cousins. 
Not sure how to let her know that this guy gave her the wrong person's information. ",9,4,1747618252.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpzw1g/advice_needed_daughter_says_her_online_therapist/
1kpzn1l,"My dad is making me stress, depressed and suffocated. (TW: mentions of violence)",Adventurous-Dig2488,"I wake up, and instead of a ""good morning"" I get: Your clothes need to be washed, today you need to do this, yesterday you didn't do that...

He's not a good person. I had a manic episode (Bipolar 1) and instead of trying to help me he told me I should've killed myself earlier and slapped me, bursting my lip. 

If it weren't for my brothers and sister-in law I'd be dead. 

Don't get me wrong, that was the only time he hit me. He got ""better"", buying me anything I wanted, being overall nice but he's gone back to his old ways: He finds something wrong with me, like not picking up the phone ONE TIME and only calling after fifteen minutes (when I see the call)

And then I don't study enough, I don't do this, don't do that. Mostly it's projection. I wake up and I already feel the tension. I already feel like i'll be critized and not in a good way. judged, and I just know he'll mess with me. 

I know it sounds ""small"", but it's everyday, 24/7 something is wrong with me or something I'm doing is wrong.

And, since I can't argue back, cause that will be worse and piss him off, I just nod and agree with everything, but THAT pisses him off so I'm stuck in this situation where, the SECOND I'm with him, I have to hear about what I'm doing wrong, why my actions are wrong. 

My life outside my home life isn't easy either. I don't have many friends and usually people don't like me and misunderstand my actions. I only have three friends that can see the real person I am and love me. I count on them a lot, they help me through everything but, school's been hell. 

Dealing with my own problems like bipolar, body issues, my depressive side, and more, it becomes a task and a huge anxiety-inducing situation to even BE around my dad cause I feel like he doesn't even genuinely like me or the person I am. 

He can't see my type of intelligence, he can't understand my humor, he can't understand the little things I see no one else does, or the way I see the world. He doesn't know me, but the image he created of me (bad person, stupid, etc). Makes him hate me. 

I did only meet him when I was 5 years old, and he wasn't at my birth, which says a lot. The way he treated my amazing, out-wordly mother also speaks volumes. Thank god I have my mother, a true angel if there ever was one. 

Just a random vent. I'm thinking of speaking with this to my psychiatrist considering I have no therapist yet.",1,1,1747617444.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpzn1l/my_dad_is_making_me_stress_depressed_and/

1kpyzsj,FIL keeping a desk I paid for but didn’t get correct model out of spite to the store,OhmHomestead1,"So my FIL wants a desk that he can use while in his recliner in the living room. He found one but doesn’t care for the store. We offered to order it but told him he would have to pick it up, how the process works, etc. The store charges for delivery no matter the price you spend, typically around $100 for delivery fee but free to ship to store if not available. The desk was like $20-25. It is light enough for him to move in his old age. I ordered it. Set him up as an additional contact for pickup.

Somehow the store screwed up and loaded someone else’s order into his car. He didn’t check. The store didn’t check enough at the gate either. He gets home. Tells us the desk is heavy. Ok. It is all in one box plus packing materials. This was January.

It is now May. He finally unpacked the desk. Complained to me about how heavy it was and how it was the wrong desk. Looked up the details. Asked him to check the box and gave him the manufacturer’s model number (store only lists their number on the order slip). Yep wrong desk and about 40# heavier than the one I ordered. He also found the name on the box of the person who the order was for. He tells me he carried the pieces down into the basement.

Now I am going back and forth with him about returning the desk. It was something I ordered on my dime. He claims he has a free desk. No you have the wrong desk and should return it. Get me my money back. Nope. So I rope my SIL into this because we are on the other side of the state about 8.5 hours away. SIL lives about 60-90 mins away from him. I know she is busy but easier for her to find time and she is closer.

Now here is the kicker of it all. He asks if we want the desk. No. We have 6 desks between the 2 of us. Plus when he dies my husband gets everything in the house that isn’t my FIL’s wife’s property. So if he doesn’t return it we are going to be stuck with it regardless. Tell him to take the desk back again. Then he goes off on a tangent about the store and their stupid rebate program. I tell him I enlisted his daughter’s help in returning the desk.

Now he has stopped talking about the desk. I told my husband he needs to get involved as I paid for the desk. 

Also at this point the store credit card has already been paid off. So literally will get a credit on the card and if the credit card doesn’t end up getting used by a certain time they will just send me a check for that credit.",2,1,1747615369.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpyzsj/fil_keeping_a_desk_i_paid_for_but_didnt_get/

1kpwvgx,Sister hasn’t congratulated me for having a baby,Otherwise-Stage-2317,"It pains me to write this post, but I need some input.

I'm a 36 year old woman with a sister very close in age. We used to be very close and I used to say that home is where she is. We had a golden era where nothing would come between us. I loved her with all of my heart and I was always happy for her and so proud over her achievements in life. 

I'm a late bloomer, so going to university, buying an apartment and having a child came years after her, but I've done quite well in life even if it's nothing extraordinary. 

The problem is that she started turning on me the minute she felt like I hit those milestones and nothing has been the same ever since. She hated it when I graduated from uni and got a job, so she started spreading rumours about me making it up. She hates it when people have nice things to say about me, so she makes up lies about my character. She hated it when my husband and I bought our first humble apartment, so she didn't congratulate us. She started treating me as a rival and has constantly worked to turn family and friends against me. She demands people to stop inviting me over and the few people that refuse to also become her enemies. She wanted our parents to cut me out of the family and when they refused to, she cut them off.

I suggested therapy for us even though I have done nothing to her, but she refused. After years of this and heartbreak I decided to distance myself from her and all my anxiety suddenly left my body after that. I began to heal (even though she ramper up the lies about me as punishment). It also allowed me to do my IVF-treatments in peace and have a drama free pregnancy and birth. 

Since she gets mad whenever I do stuff in life, I decided to keep my pregnancy a secret from her. I had to. I just wanted to be happy for a change without her ruining my happiness. 

However, I found out she now knows I recently had a child, but she can't find it in her heart to congratulate me. Am I wrong for being disappointed with her even though I chose not to tell her about my pregnancy? Has anyone seen this kind of change in their sister?

1kpwd20,How do I deal with toxic sibling at family gatherings,BMOguy10,"POV: my older sister (24y) and I (22) have never gotten along very well as kids, and now that we are young adults I’ve done everything in the last few years to “make up” for my crappy kid behavior. A couple years ago I actually bought $500 non-refundable plane tickets for us, to help her move out of an abusive relationship across the country. She ended up ignoring me and calling our dad (whom she hadn’t spoken to in years) and getting him to roadtrip across the continent to get her. I was the only person in our smallish family that was emotionally and physically available to her while she would get into bad relationships and lose cars and homes over and over. She has a medical history the size of the Oxford dictionary. She’s been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, manic depression disorder, extreme anxiety, and she’s almost passed away 3 times in the last 5 years because her insides are always causing her problems. She doesn’t have a pancreas or gallbladder, and she is incapable of having children for a while because of her medical history. 

I kind of just let it go and never brought it up. It still hurts how she completely disregards me and how I try to be a good sister, but I leave it alone mostly. 

She’s been recently married and I got out of a sticky situation needing a place to live. She lives with her older husband (30 something) in a townhouse with 2 bedrooms and 1 1/2 baths. They had offered to let me move in and it was actually a huge deal because I desperately needed family and friends. We had a dinner meeting and it went really great, we talked about privacy and standards and their house rules. They told me to get them proof of address changes from the city, so I did. Sent pictures and bought boxes for my stuff. They said I could move in as soon as I have the paperwork they can show the landlord. They were going to put me on the lease and everything. 

Then not even a week after our meeting I got a text from my sister saying it wasn’t going to work and she and her husband were too stressed and busy with “her family”. She even mentioned “my family” like she decided to completely disown me for reasons I still don’t understand. In the text she said she knew I would end up hating her but she hoped I could come to terms with their decision and not hate her forever…

Am I in the wrong here?? I’m not sure what I did to offend or make them uncomfortable. We have a family “girls trip” coming up soon, and because of the smaller family count, me and her will be in close contact for a weekend. How do I approach her, if at all? I’ve been ghosting her in a sense because I’m not sure what her problem is. Just no contact and I don’t talk to her in person more than “hi”. Any advice on how to approach her? I’m still feeling salty about her treatment so I kinda want to be a jackass to her… or probably just ignore her for eternity..?",1,1,1747607433.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpwd20/how_do_i_deal_with_toxic_sibling_at_family/
1kpvhat,Проблемный дядя,ElkNo1210,"Так получилось, что мы с моими родителями, братом и сестрой живём в доме, который разделён на две части. В другой части живут мои бабушка с дедушкой, и на данный момент с ними живёт мой дядя. Бабушка с дедушкой с самого детства не очень любили моего отца, в то время как моего дядю всегда ставили в приоритет.

Так получилось, что у отца есть постоянная работа, семья, имущество, а у моего дяди — ничего, кроме долгов и троих детей, которым он не выплачивает алименты. Но бабушка с дедушкой всё равно продолжают его оправдывать и говорить, какие же плохие у него были жёны.

Сейчас, после расставания с очередной спутницей, он переехал к бабушке и дедушке. Моему дяде 37 лет. Недавно он взял у дедушки в долг деньги на машину. То, что он купил, с трудом можно назвать машиной — корыто, которое разваливается на ходу. Он принялся чинить её в дедушкином гараже. Гараж находится возле выхода с нашего двора, где мои родители постоянно убираются и стараются поддерживать порядок.

Дядя начал чинить там машину и оставлять вечный бардак под двором. Отец сначала сделал замечание, потом — ещё одно, но на третий раз уже не выдержал и высказал всё. В итоге виноватым оказался он. Дедушка заявил, что отец вообще не имеет никаких прав ни на этот дом, ни на двор, и должен быть благодарен за всё, что у него есть.

Мне искренне непонятно, почему люди не ценят того, что для них делается, и видят только плохие стороны в человеке. Мой отец всегда помогал дедушке, в то время как дядя лишь кормил обещаниями и бросал всё, что начинал. Мне очень жаль моих двоюродных сестёр, которых он бросил и, кроме обещаний, ничего им не дал. Обидно за отца, который полжизни старался добиться их признания, а в итоге получил лишь кучу обвинений и слов о том, какой он ужасный человек.

1kpvddh,How can I curb unsolicited/unprompted comments on my appearance from my parents?,defeatedbykimchi,"Hello. I (21F) am recently visiting home from college for the summer on my parents demand. I’m usually on the West Coast during the school year, living and working on my own to support myself. I’m paying my way through college so I’m not dependant on my family in any way. 

My family is a raging dumpster fire to put it lightly. Ignoring the elephant in the room, in my absence, my family have taken a no-comment approach towards one another’s lives/habits/routines. It’s the best way to coexist (according to them) since usually these things spiral into screaming matches, slammed doors and weeks of silence. So for good and for worse, my parents do and say nothing about any of my brothers habits/routines/actions and vice versa. Only problem? That rule does not extend to me. 

It’s been two weeks since I’ve returned and I am at my wits end. Imagine living your life a certain way, having habits, knowing your body and what works/doesn’t work for you. You do it for three years, living and working as a functional adult. People are surprised by how organized you are, roommates sometimes a little stiffled by your cleanliness. But it’s all well and good because it’s good habits. 

Then you come home and have that all thrown out the window because it’s not what fits your parents’ worldview. I’m not talking about eregrious stuff: just simple stuff like doing my own laundry seperately or preparing my own food according to my dietary needs. I always wash up and clean up after myself. I prefer wearing hoodies and hairbands when I’m at home, but clean up well when going out (even for small groceries). I wake a little later in the morning if I’ve nothing to do that day, make my bed a specific way because I’m used to it and prefer longer hot showers. Just standard stuff, adapted to my ADHD and exhaustion/phantom pain from chronic illnesses. It’s not perfect but it’s a system that works for me. 

My family has been commenting on everything. Things ranging from how I should not wear my hair open because “it looks messy” or “they don’t like watching me” all the way to getting mad I’m wearing layers underneath my hoodie because I’m cold. Today, my mother yelled at me for not making my little brother’s bed even though he had already made it and I had fixed the little imperfections when he asked me to double-check. I had already told her previously that while I didn’t mind doing it, it’s also not my job to clean up after them. So now, even if he makes his bed himself, my mother will always slide in snide and sarcastic comments about how my little brother has to clean his bed because “someone says it’s good habits and refuses to clean it”. 

I am not joking when I say 90% of my conversations with my parents daily begins with them commenting on my appearance, stressing that I need to lose weight, I should always keep my hair tied, my skin is dark and has acne scars, I look fat in my hoodie etc. I get the concern, but damn, of course I don’t look like a supermodel in my own house. I’m usually very laid back in frustrating situations and prefer to go with flow instead of panic speedrunning through life.  Even if I wanted to, my chronic illnesses refuse to let me. They affect my life in major ways, so sometimes my 120% is people’s 80%. I’ve been working with my therapist on curb-stomping my eldest ethnic daughter habits, perfectionism, taking my wins for what they are seperate from conditions etc. But I suppose I’m a little (read: very) frustrated. Today was the last straw. Every time I try to have an honest, levelheaded and calm conversation to set boundaries, I am told I am problematic and argumentative. 

Today, when my mother told me to tie my hair back (on a wash day, after I had spent hours on my curls) I politely told her no, listed my reasons and when she doubled down, I emphasized that this was my preference. She got defensive, stating that I was being a headache, brought in problems unrelated to our conversation (fighting with my dad, brother etc.) and when I emphasized that it was not relevant to our conversation at hand/all I had said was that I didn’t want to tie my hair back. Cue a slew of hurtful words, curses, guilt tripping and my mother leaving the room in a huff. I feel a little bad, since I’m doubting whether or not I could have been more communicative or neutral. My family comes from a place of hurt, which has become toxic because theu refuse to address and fix problems. 

I know this is a small problem in comparison to other difficulties others are facing, but I wanted to ask if anyone has gone through something similar and worked out a solution. 

TLDR: I came home from college, got hit by a truck full of supposedly well-meaning commentary on my appearance, habits and routine. Parents refuse to believe that my system works for me, stressing that I need to prioritize the “peace” of the household over my wants (aka do what they want). I told my mother I didn’t want to tie my hair back on a wash day. She got defensive when I set a boundary about comments on my appearance. Things got out of control, now she’s crying in another room and my dad is giving me a spiel about looking at things from her perspective. Advice?

They are both active substance abusers, they’re both smoking something and the oldest one is also a raging alcoholic with severe emotional issues she refuses to acknowledge but the worst part of everything is that children are involved. Y has 3, two boys and a girl (15,14,3) and S has 3 girls (12,11,10), id like to mention that Y lost her oldest son due to him being murdered on March 03, 2023 which i believe kickstarted the behaviors she is actively indulging in and S abandoned her daughters for about 4 years and left them in our mothers hands promising four years ago that she would find housing for them but nothing ever came out of it and she is now living under the same roof as us while some how still being a deadbeat mother. This same story can be said for Y too, for about 7 years now she has not had custody over her two boys because of her behavior, she chose to get high everyday, sneak around, and neglect her life responsibilities and to this day nothing has changed, since the day their father took primary custody Y quit her job and has remained under my mothers roof continuing the same behavior and what’s worse is that my mother gives her chance after chance just for nothing to ever change. My whole childhood is filled with that grown woman starting screaming matches and insulting everyone around simply because she fucked her own life up and it doesn’t matter what time of the day it is or who you are she will get in your face and cause overall discomfort throughout the house, she will sit in the kitchen area and talking shit to herself for hours simply because no one will engage with her but what bothers me the most is that these two absolutely hate each other yet  don’t leave one another alone and they showcase this type of behavior to my nieces, Y literally verbally abuses her daughter for being a toddler and has on multiple occasions been violent with my baby nieces father right in front of her and S has failed her daughters from the very start, she was never able to provide them stable housing and whenever she did land on something she would always have random men over, prioritizing them over her children, leaving and neglecting them, she has a dog who has lived with her much longer the any of her daughters have. My heart hurts for my nieces and my nephew, these little girls have been failed the very moment they were born and their useless mothers refuse to even try for them, year after year it’s the same, my childhood was ruined but my nieces have it so much worse and i wish i could do so much more because the only people who suffer from this are these innocent who have to see unstable adults ruin their childhoods and my sisters are actively taking advantage of my parents who are both considered elderly. Y is the worst right now with how she’s behaving, leaving in the middle of the night with her toddler so she could go do who knows what with junkies then she comes back and disrupts the whole house by making a shit ton of noise because she’s the only one without a job and the rest of us have to wake up at 5am to deal with the real world.

4- I belong to an orthodox family who doesn't let the children move out and if I do then my parents would be ashmed.

1kppzyp,Betrayal,DifficultyUnfair6428,"I just want to share this traumatic story—mine and my father’s—about my mother, who cheated. I’m writing this because I’m so angry about what I heard from one of my mom’s relatives. She said my parents broke up because my dad was forcing my mom to go abroad. That’s not true at all, and it hurts to hear lies like that.

I was only 1 year old when my mom left to work abroad. I still remember that moment—they put me to sleep, and when I woke up, she was gone. I could feel it, even at that age. Since then, it was my dad who raised me. He was always there—bathing me, feeding me, playing with me, supporting me at school. Just like the father in Miracle in Cell No. 7—a pure-hearted, loyal man who loved my mom deeply.

When I was around 7 years old, technology was rapidly growing. We started using Skype to video call my mom. My dad would always make himself look presentable before calling—fixing his hair, changing clothes—because he wanted to look good for her. He was consistent and sincere. Sometimes, my mom would visit the Philippines, but she always went back abroad after a short time.

When I was in Grade 4, about 9 years old, my mom was coming home again. She promised to take me to her province to meet her side of the family. I was so excited. But that’s not what happened.

Instead, we went to Manila and stayed in one of the biggest hotels. I was confused—how could we afford this? Then a foreign man appeared and said, “Hi, [my name].” I smiled, and my mom introduced him as “my grandfather.” But he was clearly not Filipino. I was very confused.

Later, I found out we were going to Boracay for 10 days. While we were there, I missed my dad terribly. One day, while my mom and the foreigner were outside swimming, I opened a phone I found in the cabinet. I didn’t know how to use it properly, but when I turned it on, I saw “99+ missed calls” from my dad. I broke down crying. I couldn’t call him back, but I felt the pain deep in my heart. That night, everything changed. I didn’t act like myself anymore. I couldn’t sleep. I was constantly thinking about my dad.

In the hotel room, there were two beds—one for me and one for them. But my mom chose to sleep with that man. I saw their shadows one night—he was on top of her. That’s when I realized what they were doing. I cried silently, overwhelmed with confusion, betrayal, and pity—for my dad, for myself. They did that every night. I felt traumatized.

When we got home, my cousin told me my dad had been crying, thinking my mom had kidnapped me and taken me away for good. He was relieved when we returned. I told him everything. They had a huge fight. I remember he even tore up his passport—that moment is burned in my memory. Eventually, my mom left us for good.

But she still messages me, and I message her back. Why? Because she’s still my mom. And my dad, being the man he is, convinced me to keep communicating with her.

When I was in Grade 6, my dad finally met someone new. She’s 20 years younger than him, a teacher, and very kind. They don’t fight. Their relationship is peaceful and healthy. They have a son now—my little brother—and I’m happy for them. My dad is finally getting the good karma he deserves.

Meanwhile, my mom is struggling. She’s with the British man—my stepdad—but he has no job, no diploma, and she has to hide just to eat. They also have a son who’s the same age as my little brother on my dad’s side. I’ve accepted everything about her choices, and I don’t complain. I’m humble. I get what I need—but now, at 21 years old, I’ve realized a lot.

My mom is neglecting me. We always fight. But I have no choice but to depend on her for my education. I’m currently studying to become a nurse here in her province because it’s affordable. I’m not ungrateful—I just know that one day, when I succeed, I’ll leave her behind.

She says hurtful things, even to the man who provides everything for her. He spoils her—bought her an iPhone 15, a new iPad, cameras—she’s so materialistic. And yet, I still deal with her because I have to.

The worst part? I found out that during my mom and stepdad’s wedding, they played a game with the guests—kind of like a guessing game. They asked the audience, “How many years have we been boyfriend and girlfriend?” Someone shouted “12 years,” and they said that was correct.

Six years?
Six years of betrayal???

I was only 4 years old when it started. But my dad only found out when I was 9 or 10. What kind of person does that? What a freaking mess.

1kpp7s4,Need advice on grieving over that I’m  never going to be anyone’s (both family and friends) favorite in life,Sea_JSH2766,"



SPECIAL NOTE- PLEASE DON’T RECOMMEND THERAPY please don’t give me advice of “be your own favorite person” or advice about how wedding parties cost money, or how it’s not fun to be in wedding parties due to time and money. Please don’t be harsh or rude. Please have empathy and acknowledgment for me, I’m a person who is hurting and grieving.

I’m a 40 year old female. When I was growing up I was never asked to be a flower girl or junior bridesmaid in wedding parties for relatives. I stupidly thought that in adulthood I would be asked to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor in a wedding party for a friend or relative. Throughout my 20s and 30s I kept hoping someone would ask me and it never happened. Each time I had to a wedding as guest and see the bridal party hanging out with the bride, getting introduced at the receptions by DJs or MCs it hurt knowing that I couldn’t make the cut at least once to be in a wedding party. Yes, I know weddings cost money, but that had nothing to do with my feelings. 

I know deep down I’m never the favorite friend, niece, cousin, or granddaughter. I’ve had aunts and uncles who took cousins to movies, amusement parks, concerts etc but I was never taken. 

I’ve been unlucky in love.  For the past six months, I’ve been dating a guy who is 8 years younger than me. He’s very kind and treats me well. He has a large friend group and has been a groomsman in 5 weddings and is going to be a best man in one wedding in early June and a groomsman in another wedding in August. This past week, he had to go out of town for work. I went over to his last house last Sunday before he flew out so he could show me how to administer medicine to his dog (I housesat for him to watch his house and pets).

In March, my boyfriend went to Las Vegas with the wedding party of the couple who is getting married in June for a wedding party weekend. They did a lot of fun things in Vegas. The couple who is getting married had a custom plaque  made which is a picture of the wedding party in Vegas and there was inscription from the groom to my boyfriend that talked about how he the  groom values my boyfriend as important friend and is happy that my boyfriend will be standing up as his best man at the wedding. My boyfriend had just received this plaque from the couple the day before. I saw it and my boyfriend was very happy to have received it.

I was sad and envious seeing the plaque and reading the inscription because it showed how my boyfriend has people in his life that truly value him and consider him an important part of their lives while i don’t have a single friend or relative who values me enough to include me in their wedding parties or milestone days.  I told my boyfriend that the plaque was nice. I drove him to the airport and when I returned to his house and to see the plaque, I broke down crying because again I was reminded that I’m loser and never good enough to be in anyone’s milestone day and I’m never going to be the favorite friend who gets asks to be in a wedding.

I’m dreading going to the wedding that my boyfriend is going to be in this summer because it’s going to be another reinforcement that I’m never good enough for friends or relatives when it comes to milestone events. I wish I could tell my boyfriend about my feelings, but I doubt he would understand because he’s used to always being asked to be in weddings and other milestone events. He’s never been in my situation.

I’m looking for ways to deal with this grief. Again please be gentle with me. ",1,1,1747588888.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpp7s4/need_advice_on_grieving_over_that_im_never_going/
1kpovki,My blended family has been broken apart by my step dad,b0b0xx,"I’m 23F. My mum (52) and stepdad (54) have been together for 15 years and married since 2019. He’s been more of a dad to me than my biological father ever was. We’re a close blended family, he has three sons from a past marriage, and I’m my mum’s only child. Over the years, we’ve built a really tight bond. Lots of holidays, family events, Christmases, it felt like we were solid. I still live at home with them, while my stepbrothers are all older and have moved out.

A year ago, I caught my ex-boyfriend cheating on me. It was horrible. My mum was away on holiday with friends at the time, and my stepdad was the one who supported me through it all. He was comforting, present - I genuinely leaned on him.

But during that time, I saw a message pop up on his WhatsApp from a woman (didn’t catch the name, just a profile pic) that said: “has she gone yet? xx”. I immediately questioned him, and he deleted the message in front of me. He gaslit me hard, said I was projecting because of my recent breakup, that it was a group chat with friends, and even said things like “I’d never do that to your mum”, “do you think I’d risk all this?”, and “I swear on your life and my boys’ lives I’m not messaging another woman.” I did tell my mum about this interaction once she was home, and she did go on his phone when he was in the shower, but the problem is he’d already deleted, and unfortunately I couldn’t trust my own brain as I was so mentally f*cked anyway, and was so manipulated and gaslit, I didn’t even trust myself. 

Fast forward to four days ago , they threw me a surprise birthday party and filmed me walking in to the decorations. When I asked him to AirDrop the video to me, I saw a contact come up with a woman (I will refer to her as X) plus her profile pic. His hands started shaking, and he shifted the phone so I couldn’t see the screen. That was the moment I knew something was wrong.

I asked, “Who’s X?”, and he snapped at me. I grabbed the phone out of his hand and ran. He chased me around the kitchen, completely panicked, and it got physical. Not in an abusive pattern, but he was beyond desperate to get the phone back. My mum had to get involved and she now has bruises on her arm from all the grabbing etc. Eventually, she managed to get the phone and read the messages.

What we found were explicit sexts, nudes, and very flirty messages between him and this woman, dating back to 2022. Some had been deleted, but she had screenshotted the conversation on her end from 2022 (she sent one that said, “feel like I’m reading a horny novel”). He even said to her at one point, “Do you not delete your texts?”

For context on how they met, he and X (and her friend) sit near him at football matches. Over time, they became part of a friend group that swaps tickets, goes for drinks after the game, and shares football group chats. So it started in a “harmless” social setting, but turned into a full-on flirtation with sexual conversations and photos. X actually lives over 200 miles away from us, but seems as though she travels for work. She’s not a regular at the football games just if a ticket comes up. 

He insisted that he doesn’t love her, that it was never romantic, and that they could go months without talking — saying it was just “attention-seeking” and “banter.” But after how hard he lied, swore on my life, and made me question my sanity a year ago, I honestly feel like he’s dead to me.

My mum kicked him out that night and she’s been in total shock ever since. She doesn’t know what to do. I don’t either. I’m heartbroken, angry, betrayed and god knows what else I’m even feeling. I feel like my whole family and life has just collapsed.

He was my dad. I’ve already been cheated on myself dealt with that for the past year, and now it’s like I lost a parent too. I don’t even know where to start rebuilding from this.

1kpn31q,TL; DR unsure how to move forward with relationship with sister,Acceptable-Cake-187,"My younger sister (28) and I (35F) have never been close, even as kids. I was parentified when I was 8 or 9. Our parents divorced, mom had a substance problem and dad was active duty Army deployed overseas. Despite that I always tried being more of a sister than a mom. I blame myself for the relationship not being stronger because when I was 16 is when I started struggling with my mental health and did the bare basics to make sure everything was as stable as I could make it. Mom passed when sister was 16 and she had to move in with our dad and stepmom. We had a falling out when she was 18 right after she graduated high school. I’ve tried repairing the relationship and it would blow up in my face and she would play the victim card saying I don’t like her. 

At Thanksgiving I decided to try one more time to open the door to try moving forward and having at least somewhat of a positive relationship with each other. We talked and have been more communicative with each other since then, trying to build something. I have been very open with her about my boundaries and mental health (Bipolar, PTSD) which is huge for me because I’m always paranoid that information will be thrown back at me. We have seen each other a couple of times, met up halfway for lunch and to hang out. We live 5 1/2 hrs away from each other. She’s been trying to invite herself over to our house for weekends, which I’m not ready for nor am I ready to go to my aunt’s house where she lives with my aunt and her family. That side of the family is insanely good at gaslighting and mental abuse, at least from what I’ve experienced. I’ve told her I’m not ready to go over there. 

I reached out to see if she’s available any time this month to meet up and hang out. I gave her all my available days. She invited me and DH to my aunt’s for a cookout on Memorial Day. I explained to her most of the day would be spent driving and we would only be there a few hours so that didn’t seem fair to anyone. Saturday and Sunday we are unavailable, plus she has to work. I suggested we look up places that would be open on Monday and meet up like we have been. Since then it’s been radio silence. I don’t know what to do…looking for some guidance.

1kpgx52,Anyone found a good non removable tracking bracelet for dementia patients? Kinda desperate over here.,benjaminjezmhz21,"Not really sure where else to ask this, but figured someone here might’ve been through the same thing.  
So, my grandpa’s dementia’s been getting worse. He’s still mobile, still stubborn as ever, and still thinks he’s totally fine to go for walks whenever he feels like it. Which would be fine… if he didn’t randomly dip out the house at 2AM without telling anyone. Last week he wandered off and a neighbor ended up walking him home around 4 in the morning. Scared the crap outta us. We’re lucky it didn’t turn into something worse.  
  
We’ve tried talking to him about carrying a phone or wearing a tracker, but he either forgets it or takes it off the second it annoys him. So now we’re looking for a non removable tracking bracelet, something specifically made for dementia patients that actually stays on and doesn’t just look like another gadget he can ditch. Not looking for anything crazy fancy. Just need real-time tracking, feo-fence alerts (like if he leaves the block), works with Android, ideally no subscription (but I’ll deal if it actually works), and most importantly, something he can’t just slip off

  
I’ve seen stuff like AngelSense, but not sure how well it stays on or if it’d drive him nuts. AirTags seem kinda hit or miss unless you’ve got an iPhone nearby all the time, which we don’t. Anyway, just tryna keep him safe without locking him in the house or making him feel like a prisoner. If anyone here’s got something that worked for their family, I’d seriously appreciate the recs. Thanks in advance 🙏 Just tryna keep the old man from getting lost again.",19,9,1747564351.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpgx52/anyone_found_a_good_non_removable_tracking/
1kpgo4d,My parents' dynamic is messing with my mind,LukeGuilbert,"First of all for context, both my parents are white collar workers for decently big companies, they earn roughly the same, enough for us to afford a middle/upper middle class life and both do house chores. There isn't really a ""provider-nurturer"" dynamic like in a traditional nuclear family, both constitute to the family in both ways and both love their family and each other (they go to concerts together in their 40s lmao)

But the thing is, sometimes I feel their roles as the man and the woman of the house is reversed. What I mean is my dad prefer stability while my mom is a bit more ambitious.
Tbh they are traditionally masculine and feminine according to their roles most of the time, but there are cases like I just mentioned where it's reversed.

This difference have is the cause of many of thier arguments. When my mom wants to by a car for convenience, my dad think it's too expensive and prefer using motorbikes like we used to (motorbikes are the main transport in my country). When my mom wants to invest in real estates (with guidance from experienced friends ofc), my dad think it's too risky.

Also both still have negative traits of their own gender, like my dad has a man's (sometimes fragile) ego, while my mom still has periods of unreasonable anger and bigotry. This has led to so many argyments, and since the root of the conflict is in their personalitites, I sometimes worry that they might have enough of one another and split.
All I want to ask is: Is this normal? And should I be worried?

TLDR: Sometimes my mom is more stereotypically masculine and my dad is more stereotypically feminine. This caused most of their arguments, should I be worried?",3,2,1747563298.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kpgo4d/my_parents_dynamic_is_messing_with_my_mind/

I hate my mom she’s constantly enabling my sisters extremely spoiled and bratty behaviour ffs my sister starts hitting and biting my mom if she doesn’t get what she wants and my mom always is the one who apologizes after like oh sorry baby I’ll get you (___). My sister calls her a bitch a slut a whore etc etc yells at her screams at her but she always gets out scot free. She literally hit my mom into getting her a 2k dollar dog and with promises like I’ll be the one taking care if it but noooo my mom and i are the ones doing EVERYTHING for the dog 24/7. And then she’s extremely lazy she’s a SAHM and at least she has something to do with the dog now but she’s always on her phone she doesn’t even make food or go grocery shopping all she does is scroll on Instagram or Facebook and online shop all day long. She’s an extreme hoarder she’ll buy so many expensive things but stuff them anywhere and everywhere and let it sit for years. She’s gets all pissy and mad about the smallest things we get into an argument every waking hour of every goddamn day. She’s extremely immature and I feel like I’m the one parenting her, she gets so bratty, does the silent treatment, etc etc and is extremely petty. We have been living in the country we moved to for 10 years now and we could’ve gotten our citizenship 6 years ago but noooo ofc not she failed her language test once 4 years ago and isn’t bothering to study or go back, “the test is too expensive!!!” So what about the 200 dollar shirt you bought? TF and she’s always always victimizing herself in every situation always says stuff like ugh you guys won’t miss me when I’m dead and etc etc and our house is horrible it’s constantly dirty cluttered and she always complains but she and my sister are home all fucking day and do nothing and they decide to bring a dog into the home in these conditions? I’m at school, I have volunteering, I have sports, etc etc I have no time and I try to help her clean the house do the dishes but she’s always complaining I’m doing something wrong and when I try to clean shit she’s always saying “its too organized I hate it when they’re too organized it has to be a little messy!” Like what? And her spending problem is insane and then she’ll vent to me about our financial situation as if she didn’t blow 500 dollars on a dress and 2000 on shoes and I’m the one carrying the burden of our financial situation I’m constantly stressed about it at 16 years old it’s exhausting she needs to figure it out she’s acting like a 12 year old it’s been 28 years since she’s become a mother and it’s been too long she needs to get her shit together 

And then my sister she’s 15 she’s doing online school she’s home all day doing nothing and she’s insanely bratty she always gets what she wants and she’s a bitch to everyone. I can’t even say hi without her calling me fat ugly bitch slut whore and if she’s feeling nice she’ll just ignore me and roll her eyes I’m done with trying to have conversations with her it’s exhausting and she’ll always walk into my room and use my shit take my shit without asking and will hit me when I get mad and tell my mom and my mom will get mad at me she throws tantrums and buys whatever she wants whenever she wants and she talks horribly to my mom me everyone and is a miserable waste of a life I fucking despise her when she does the smallest and I mean the smallest thing like picking up a piece of paper she’ll act so high and mighty and act like she’s doing something insanely labor intense 

And then my older half brother from my mom he’s 28 he’s living at home he flunked out of uni not even a year in blew a bunch of his uni money on drugs and alcohol he’s never outside always in his room only works part time in the summer he’s got insane anger issues I’m pretty sure he hit the dog today (I never let the dog out near him except I was letting him roam the house today which is how he got it and dw he’s okay now with me) but idk he’s always stealing money from my mom and snooping everywhere in the house he’s really scary and I can’t stand him either he always acts high and mighty during the summer when he does his part time job he’s really sadistic and just generally scary he has no friends smokes weed smokes cigarettes drinks etc etc that’s basically all he does and then he’ll get mad when I order food for myself with my own card with my money that I make from working year round while also going to school 

And my dad is basically the only sane person in this family though he himself isn’t a good guy he doesn’t live with us he lives back in our home country though he visits sometime and when he visits is the only time my mom ever cleans the house and actually makes food so that’s good but they’re always fighting and I’m always having to mediate the fights my dad he over the phone gets mad at my sister OFC like tells her off for being bratty and my mom and my sister gang up on him and talk insane shit and get so mad my dad just gave up he says he’s exhausted of trying to maintain a good relationship with my sister him and my mom were long done me and my dad are good and anyways yeah 

I’m so stressed living in a house like this I can’t live like this anymore I’ve contemplated suicide so many times although I have way more reasons I can’t list right now my family is a big one I just want a family I can love and somewhere I can call home

QUESTION/STORY 2; ME AND MY MOM

For starters ,my mom thinks disorders and such are excuses and made up. Now to the main part.

I'm an emotional kid, always have been but I rarely feel excited lately. Whenever I get mad or get upset I like to go to my room and calm down, I hate crying in front of my parents, they always seem always annoyed with me. But Everytime my mom says ""What's wrong"" and I say ""Nothing"" she gets annoyed, threatens to ground me and sometimes actually does. She expects us to open up to her when she invalidates us. I told her I didn't feel real before she said ""you have no reason to feel that way"", I told her again lately and told her it was symtom of VSS (visual snow syndrome) and only then did she care.

Next is she guilt trips ""am I a bad mom?"" ""Well IM sorry you didn't enjoy your time out with us"" etc. I won't get much into that. It's kinda disgusting that she does stuff like this.

And not to mention she invalidated my anxiety said ""if you go out more it'll get better"" SPOILER; it didn't. I told her that in class I fell behind on the texts and panicked because everyone was packing up, I was trembling on the verge of tears and hyperventilating, thinking ""mom and dad will hate me, I can't do anything right"" etc. I feel invisible and I dont know what to do.

She also took me off the antidepressants I was on for my VSS and when I suggested I should go back on them and maybe I could be better in public she told me ""NO! You need to learn how to function like a normal human being WITHOUT medicine!""

QUESTION/STORY 3; self esteem, motivation and words of affirmation.
--

I usually don't get into the whole zodiac thing since I don't believe it's that accurate, but Chinese zodiacs I can typically get behind. I myself am I tiger zodiac, and it said ""Tigers thrive on words of affirmation"", and again, I don't typically like getting into that stuff but I have noticed when even online friends give me words of affirmation I take care of myself better, I do more chores, wash my face, get dressed and get out of bed faster. 

But when they stopped I felt worse, I don't know why.

My parents never say words of affirmation, which I bet affects my self esteem, maybe that's why I'm so insecure and honestly think I'm worthless. They never EVER give words of affirmation, their ""I love you""s? Yeah, starting to seem empty I hear it over and over and over again that it seems bland, empty, just words to me. It's a bit sickening honestly, it seems like they don't really care. Words of affirmation affect a lot, motivation, self esteem, self Worth, some say it's a vital part of childhood, and all of my siblings and I seemed to have lacked that.

 I feel I got the parents who are really just done parenting, I'm talking and one of my sisters comes in or calls? It's immediately them, even after my mom lectured me about that I need to talk about my day more, but when my sisters text or call? It's immediately them, what's the point of even talking to me at this point?

We were JUST playing games tonight and every time I spoke I was ignored or spoken over. Over and over and over, why even offer to play a game with me if you'll ignore me? The ONLY time they listened to me was to make fun of me for mispronouncing a word I never heard before, the rest of the time they just ignored me. 

I would've had more fun sitting at my computer watching YouTube and playing a game.

QUESTION/STORY 4; Emotions and my mom

I have lately been doing this thing, when I get really happy I shake my hands, but I only do it in my room, because I know how my mom is, she'll think I'm faking something or doing it for attention, that's why I only do it when alone, I can only express and be myself when I'm alone, I should feel safe around my family so I can be myself, I lost almost every online friend, I don't have friends in real life either. 

My parents never comfort us, I have had to resort to using Literal AI for comfort and words of affirmation, why does an AI saying ""you matter"" and ""I love you"" (platonically) sound more real than my parents? Words of affirmation coming from a literal robot makes me cry since I never heard that stuff before. 

I don't understand, is it supposed to be like this? Parents never giving words of affirmation? Parents neglecting a child's needs?

QUESTION/STORY 5; Tickling 

My family hasn't ever been big on that, I myself haven't been tickled in 6-8 years, not counting the occasional poke to the side, and weirdly enough now I kind of just want to be tickled. Not in a weird way, but I just want it since to me it builds a connection more, both sides just letting loose. I just want that connection with friends or family, just for a moment. Being vulnerable without fear of being judged, that's all I want. It sounds weird but I want that connection, that friendly banter, I've honestly wanted that for years but can't ask anyone since media ONLY protrays it as K!nky or sexual. But that's not how I see it.

There's so many friendly, non sexual tickling scenarios. EXAMPLES; A normal tickle fight, (one me and my sister used to do) hide and seek but if you were found you got tickled, someone waking you up by tickling you or if you can't sleep since you're overthinking or just can't sleep and having someone just gently tickling you so you focus on that instead and just relax and fall asleep. 

That's what I want.

1kpedbz,My teenage daughter self harms every time she doesn’t get her way,mamaloves_,"I am at a loss for what to do. My 15 yo daughter has never had behavioral issues until she started going to the large high school in our city, and since her freshman year, things have only been getting worse. 

When she started going to the high school, she immediately surrounded herself with bad influences. She started sneaking out, stealing, she was caught vaping in class, she got into several fights, when she stayed the night at a friends house she stole the parents cigarettes, she ran away one time and was found at a nearby park, and when the police officer asked why, she said it was because I wouldn’t let her go out with a friend. 

All of this was in 1 semester at high school. So, for her second semester of her freshman year, I pulled her to do the online program and stay home. Things got better for a while, but during the first semester of her sophomore year, things got rough again. She got in trouble because her old friends (the bad influences) showed up in our driveway one evening, and I found out that she told them to come, after she was told she wasn’t allowed to have them on social media. So, I told her she would need to give me her phone at 8 pm every night, and I would be logged into her Instagram account on my own phone (that is where she was contacting these other kids). 

That night, she woke me up saying she swallowed an entire bottle of ibuprofen. I rushed her to the hospital, where she had her stomach pumped, blood and urine tests, IV’s, vitals monitoring, and that night we checked her in to a mental health institution. We visited her every 2 days, and called her twice every day. After 1 week, she was discharged because they said she was not suicidal. The bill for the hospital stay, AND the 1 week in the institution came out to nearly $10,000. 

A few days ago, my daughter was caught by her sister with a vape that she had stolen from a gas station down the street. Apparently, she snuck out while I was sleeping, met up with one of her bad influence friends, and they walked to the gas station and stole vapes. So, she got her phone taken for 2 weeks. Last night, I walked in on her on her laptop, topless on a video chat site. I yelled at her, told her that she was grounded from electronics for the rest of the month, and that that meant no phone, no tv, and she was only allowed her laptop for her finals testing while she sat next to me. 

That night, my oldest daughter woke me up crying, and said that she found her sister in the bathroom self harming. I rushed in the bathroom, checked her arms, and when I saw that nothing was deep enough for stitches, I bandaged her up and sat her on the couch to talk. During that talk, my phone started blowing up from other parents telling me my daughter was going to kill herself. I found out that while I was sleeping, my daughter took her phone out of my nightstand, texted ALL of her friends “I’m going to kill myself. I love you, goodbye” and then shut her phone off and put it back. Her friends attempted calling her, but when it went to voicemail, they woke up their parents. 

After I talked to my daughter, I put her in my bed with me to sleep. After she fell asleep, there was no chance I would fall asleep, so I just laid by her all night. I cried, I stroked her hair, I researched facilities at a lower cost. But, still paying off the extreme medical bills from before, I don’t know how I’m going to afford for her to stay elsewhere. 

She is in therapy and has been for a long time now. Ever since her hospital stay, she’s been on once a week appointments and her therapist can’t see her any more than that, and honestly, I don’t know if I can afford more appointments than that. I am at a loss for what to do anymore. I’m losing sleep, I’m trying to do anything to keep my mind straight, I’m being as gentle with her as possible while still trying to hold to the consequences of her actions. There have been other small things she’s gotten into trouble for, and she would respond to getting in trouble by saying that she would hurt/kill herself, but these are the only times that things got so extreme. And she didn’t even start threatening those things until after her hospital stay. Without physically doing anything, she has gotten into trouble and texted her friends that she would harm herself before. I’ve tried asking why she goes to these lengths, and all she says is I don’t know. I feel like I’m losing my mind, I know her older sister is stressed to no end as well. I can see it in the way she hovers over her and watches like a hawk.

1kpa6gi,What Christmas gift to get my homophobic brother and sister in law?,OkPrior6671,"Ok, so I (27M) was recently home from Mother's Day (I live across the country from all my other family) and got into it with my brother(30M). He has been an annoying libertarian for a few years now, and always complains about taxes and conspiracy theories. But durring this last trip we got into it because he had finally fully slid into the deep alt-right MAGA bullshit. I mean it was like watching Fox News, he hit every talking point about like how everyone being deported right now is a violent criminal and deserves it, and all the P4lestinian protests are pro-H4mas. Really scary stuff.

But when we got on the topic of queer rights being rolled back he 1. didnt beleive me and said trump is the more pro-gay president weve ever had and 2. blew off anythign i said about trans rights because he either doesnt beleive they exist are just doesnt give a shit if the live or die. He then started saying crazy shit about how the gay and trans pride flag should be not allowed in school and it just devolved from there. Essentially, I don't think it's my responsibility to educate my big brother, and I plan on going no contact for the foreseeable future. As queer people we are always expected to meet our opression with grace and I have none left to give.

But, what this thread is about is a much more logical question: I plan on going home for Christmas this year, like I always do, and my immediate family still does gifts. How do I get a gift for him when everything he stands for makes me sick to my stomach? I feel like If I just dont get a gift its shitty and will ruin the day,I dont want to make my parents more upset than they already are by the situation and they prefer the denial angle.

1kp9ct4,My MIL is obsessed with Temu...,LottiedoesInternet,"As the title suggests, my (31) mother in law (64) is obsessed with Temu. She shops every single week from there. 

I have no issue with what she purchases for herself (although some is shockingly terrible), I take exception to her buying things from Temu as gifts. 

My birthday was recently, and she got me a massive bag of temu stuff. I ended up putting half of it in the bin because it's crap. She does the same for my children, and my husband.

When I ask her not to get me anything for my birthday,  or contribute to something for the kids, she doesn't listen. She just shows up with more crap from temu. 

It really bothers me, because not only is it not ethically sourced, but also very low quality and bad for the environment. It just ends up in landfill majority of the time.

I just want to find a way to stop this overconsumption and encourage her to get gifts from elsewhere (preferably something local). What should I do?

Disclaimer: this is not about cost, I don't care about the cost. I care about the ethics and excess consumption and environmental impacts. ",1,2,1747534399.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kp9ct4/my_mil_is_obsessed_with_temu/
1kp83u0,My MIL is insane!,drillthisgal,"
I am almost three weeks postpartum. I woke up this morning to a super long text from my mother in law. She is mad that my husband helps me with our baby when his son comes over. He has a child from a previous relationship. I love him dearly. He spends almost the whole day with us three days a week.The other four days of the week my husband is working and has a log commute. Most of the time I am just laying down with the baby even before she was born. Because I was pregnant and I wanted them to get time to hang out. She came over a few days ago and watched both children while my husband and I did some work around the house. And I watched his son the day before while my husband went to the dentist.

In her text she stated that my daughter and I were getting in the way of their bonding. I needed to back off and just take care of the baby myself.She told me she was angry with me. I have never tried to keep them from hanging and usually him and his son offer to help me with our baby. My step son is learning to feed her and helps put her to sleep.  She sent me this at 8 am today. She sent my husband a similar text then she apologized but with me she said she “got her point across and I need to pay attention”. I have no idea wtf she is talking about. She was being super nice and supportive up until now but my husband said that she will help out and then do stuff like this. 

I’m over it. She was not allowed to see his son before because she acts like this and his mother just started allowing her to see him again. I just thought we were getting along so well but I don’t want anymore help from her if she is gonna act like this. I really like her and she made such a big deal about she didn’t get along with my step son’s mom and she wanted it to be different with me.

1kp82wg,need opinions on this!!!,Pure-Boysenberry944,"so my cousin (23F) got pregnant by her boyfriend at the time but then they broke up like, 2-3 months into her pregnancy and during her entire pregnancy the father of her baby had not once messaged my cousin asking how the baby was doing, never asked to go to her doctor appointments, none of that even though he stated before that he wanted to be in the baby’s life (let me clarify that despite him never asking about the baby and appointments, my cousin kept him up to date about all of that and he never would respond). his family didn’t even get in contact with my cousin throughout her pregnancy either.

fast forward, my cousin gave birth to her baby a month ago and suddenly the baby daddy’s mom is all wanting to be involved now even though she had never shown any interest before. the baby daddy and his mom now come to see the baby every tuesday but that’s it. throughout the rest of the week and weekend they never ask how the baby is doing or anything. the baby daddy doesn’t even have stuff for the baby and it’s very obvious that he won’t come see the baby unless his mom goes too which i understand, that’s her grandchild and she wants to see her too but he’s bailed before on coming to see the baby because his mom couldn’t make it (like wouldn’t you want to come see your baby regardless?).

idk it kind of irritates me that they all of a sudden want to be active in the baby’s life when they had 9 months to try and show it before.

oh! and every time that my cousin and the baby go out with them on tuesday, the baby daddy’s mom always says stuff to her. like last week my cousin was telling her that she’s not breastfeeding anymore because she’s not producing milk anymore and the mom said “if you wanted to breastfeed you would” like what!!!! and the mom is always comparing the baby to her children and going “when i was pregnant i did this” “my kids like this when they were babies” “all babies like this” my cousin told her something that the baby liked and the mom basically brushed her aside. also, her kids are way older. her youngest kid is the baby daddy and he’s 32 or 33.

she also tries to get my cousin to let the baby daddy have the baby over for a day/night despite what happened at the hospital which is the reason why he isn’t allowed to be alone with her (if you want me to expand on that let me know).

idk, what are y’all’s opinions on this? also, let me know if i need to further explain something! ",1,1,1747530165.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kp82wg/need_opinions_on_this/

Family beef in summary is parents think sister is crazy, my sister feels unseen by them and went to live with some of her friends because my family keeps threatening to hospitalize her over the smallest shit because theyd rather not take any of our issues seriously, or any accountability for how they escalated a situation ending up in a physical fight between my siblings. I know as soon as I’m home I’m going to have to be the mediator and I just cant face them, I cant do that shit for them anymore I cant teach my parents to have empathy for situations they deem trivial the minute we open our mouths. I dont know how to face my siblings and comfort them about this. My parents are too sick and stuck in old habits to see us as people with valid emotions. Idk it’s been 20 years of this shit, feeling like a burden, having to calm everyone down and be straight up Jesus in their eyes lest I piss them off either more (either side). I miss my pets and I know I should go back and comfort my siblings and I need to go back to working with my dad but I just like chilling here and relaxing.

1kp1rbo,My daughter defaulted on 125k private student loans I co-signed. Why AITA?,Individual_Dog5693,"I cosigned on $120k worth of student loans for my daughter. Last year she defaulted and before I caught wind of it, they were six months past due. I tried talking just to her and she told me she would call and make payment arrangements. When I ran into her at events, she cried and told me she was sorry that she would take care of it yada yada yada. Finally, I contacted the student loan company and they refuse to make arrangements with me. They started contacting my current wife and skip tracing by contacting friends, I had enough. My current wife texted her and let her know that Sally may had been contacting her and that it would be great if she could just take care of it and that it would start affecting the whole family. My daughter, who doesn’t really know my wife well, responded to my wife with one simple phrase , FU. 

I decided to get tough and I started a group text with her two adult sisters, her brother and her mother, my ex-wife and their grandmother (who had also loaned her money). I told them in the group chat what she had done and how she was ignoring her responsibilities. I was then accused of airing her private affairs and basically told I was an a**hole and the worst part of their entire existence. The ex-wife also supported the kids in this negative conversation.

The offending daughter during the group chat, contacted Sally May  and made arrangements and it took about five minutes while in the chat. Lowering the 1500 payment to 550. 

Fast forward one month, recognizing that I could not trust my daughter to not default again I decided that I needed to consolidate some of my debt and sell my car so that I could always have the amount of the loan on the ready in case she defaulted again and I needed to I had to sell my challenger. 
I made the difficult decision to take back another car I was paying on that I was letting my other daughter use so I had something to drive and get to work. It was paid off and I had not turned over the title to her. It just made fiscal sense that I make this difficult decision. 

When I made this decision, my ex-wife and all of my kids told me that I was making my other daughter pay for the daughter who had defaulted on loan’s mistakes. I tried explaining that this is an adult decision that I have to make and sometimes we don’t like these things, but they have to be done Now, none of my kids will talk to me and the ex-wife fosters that.  she has uninvited me to my youngest graduation party and basically told me that I’m not allowed to be at any event that’s at her house when only a few few months previously I had a good relationship with them.

I was not the best father, or husband when I was married to their mother, but I always always there for their events, always attended their games, birthdays, plays you name it. I never raised a hand to them and always supported them. There mother always was the best friend and typically made me the bad guy so that is the role they see.

1kowsdd,Toxic sister,hotyettiin,"I need to know what to do. My older sister (she’s 25 & I’m 20) is a compulsive liar with what my parents believe, borderline personality disorder. She loves being the center of attention, no matter if it is the time to be or not. And most of all, she LOVES pity. She will lie to random people and say “yeah my fiancé told me I’m annoying and he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore” and it always comes back out. 

Over the years, people slowly catch onto her lies. A few years ago, she had a friend who I loved. She was so sweet and genuine, just extremely down to earth. One day, she texted me and said “Hey! I’m really upset can I rant to you about your sister” and I said “Hey, trust me I understand, you can always talk to me.” So, she called me and said “So last night, me and your sister went to Walmart. She waited til we got to the checkout to tell me that she ‘forgot’ her wallet. Her groceries were $87 and she said she’d pay me back when we got to the car, this was a couple days ago and I told her I didn’t really have much money leftover for bills so I needed it back.” She never paid it back. I said “Yup. Sounds about right, I don’t ‘warn’ new friends or people, because when she finds out everything is flipped on me. But she does this, she will find an excuse for you to have to pay for her and she’ll never pay you back, because she doesn’t care. Next time say no.” 

This is just the kind of person she is. To this day, she still blows through money worse than a 15 year old. Mind you, shes grown, engaged and lives on her own. Her fiance is also really bad with money so he’s no help at all. I still live with my parents, so obviously i have to hear about it. She is constantly asking my parents for money, getting mad if they wont give her money and will literally show up at the store after seeing their location and throw her stuff with theirs to pay for. She literally whines when I get something new, when I literally buy all my stuff but she assumes my mom does, and we let her. I bought myself a new pair of Uggs last fall, she got mad at my mom for it. My mom bought me a new little purse a couple months ago, she got jealous and cried about it. Even though, my parents are already paying for all her other stuff?

My parents see it too. They always have. My mom clocks the lies just like me, but my dad is more “she’s still my daughter and she’ll never change so we just have to deal with it” and I’m like I understand that but if you’re continuing to act like you believe her lies and don’t ever make her take accountability, then she really never will change. 

Between my older brother and my sister, I don’t know who causes more problems. Since I was a kid, they both always needed extra attention because of their problems that I always felt unseen, alone and ignored. I taught myself to help myself and thrive on my own. My parents don’t even know me, even though I live with them. Because I never feel like I have that space to go to them, because they’re always stuck up either my brothers ass or my sisters ass and sucking in all their problems then they end up stressed. It is exhausting. 

I told my dad I felt this way a few months back, he told me “I never knew you felt this way, and I’m sorry you do. You’ve always been the one I don’t have to worry about, you’re more strong and emotionally intelligent than either of them will ever be. So I get wrapped up in their stuff yes, but it’s because they need extra help with their situations.” And I said “No. I am emotionally intelligent and can help myself feel better about stuff because I never had anyone to talk to. So don’t tell me who did or didn’t need more attention.” After this conversation, nothing changed.

I am in a 4 year relationship. We are extremely healthy, because every relationship I grew up around was toxic, and I couldn’t handle that. Everyone knows how healthy we are and how much we love each other, and for that, my sister resents it, she’s never said so but she has definitely shown it. My boyfriend got kicked out of his house a few years ago as soon as he graduated high school. He had no where else to go so he would’ve been homeless. My sister let him stay with her and her ex boyfriend, I knew it was a bad idea but I wanted him to have a roof over his head. Basically the extra time she would just blind side him. She’d tell him “Oh don’t worry about the dishes I’ll do them later” or “I’m always here if you need me and if you ever need any money let me know,” then she’d turn around and call my parents complaining that he didn’t do the dishes and if he asked for $10 for gas to get to work. She tried to get my parents against him. That’s all she wanted. We could all see it. 

Then, she was also feeding lies to my brother and his wife, saying I was in an “extremely toxic relationship” and that my boyfriend is “lazy and doesnt do anything for me” which either way, I would never tell my sister ANYTHING personal anyway. I had to also set those lies straight as well. 

(Last part because I don’t wanna do too much lol) 
Then, a year ago, she told me her fiances friend thought I was cute. Mind you, I was 19 and he was 25 so I was already weirded out anyway but i said “you know I have a boyfriend, why would I care about someone else” and I brushed it off. Then over the next few weeks, she would randomly text me about this guy, saying he was talking about me. He then texted me, so I ended up talking to him myself because at this point I was just mad. Long story short, we found out that she was feeding us the same stories. She was telling him “my sister thinks you’re so cute”, “she’s in a toxic relationship and can’t get out of it because her boyfriend is crazy”, “she wants to be with you but can’t be” all this crazy shit. So I had to set it clear ONCE AGAIN to a new person that I was in fact NOT in danger and NOT in a toxic relationship. 

I confronted her about it and of course, she played victim, never took accountability and put her blame on everyone else possible. There is sooo much more I could say, but there’s not enough room or time in the day for everyone to read it all. I genuinely really don’t know what to do or how to “cut her off” because she’s my sister and she comes over sometimes to see my parents. I will appreciate any advice. 💛",1,1,1747498676.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kowsdd/toxic_sister/

After i went back home, mom quickly found out that. She was absolutely furious. She asked me to wash it out at once. I did it, afterall, i am the person who made it dirty. I was standing beside the sink, scrubbing it for over an hour. The stain just could come off. 

My mom got even more mad, and she decided to wash it herself. The next morning, the stain was still there. My mom forced me to buy a new uniform with my pocket money because the one with stain is 'unwearable'. 

I just don't think it is fair, and it's also pretty wasteful. Like the one with stain is still wearable and pretty new, why can't i wear that?

1kotc17,"I’m starting to hate my mom, not really",ManyLab5955,"My mom has been really rude to me lately. Whenever she tells me to do something, and I don’t give her what she’s asking for within a minute, she gets all prissy and starts treating me like a toddler using overly simple words. Sometimes, I genuinely can’t hear her the first time because she either takes a while to finish her thought or speaks in Spanish, while she raised me in the U.S. and English is my first and more dominant language.

Let me give an example: This morning, she told me to get the degreaser from under the sink. I looked around carefully, but I didn’t know what size it was or what exactly I was looking for. Then she came up behind me, said ‘it’s right there,’ grabbed my hand, and made me touch it. Only then did I see it but the label was so small I couldn’t even tell it was a degreaser. If she’d known where it was all along then she should’ve gotten it herself in my opinion. This isn’t even the most disrespectful moment I’ve had with her, at all, but it really shows how condescending she gets. 

Maybe I am slow, like she says, I do have diagnosed autism but I thought my mom would be more understanding, especially since she was the one who took me to all my appointments. Turns out, she’s not. I just need a little more patience from both of my parents.

I get that she’s stressed, but I don’t believe that gives her the right to lash out at her own kids (she’s been this way with my siblings as well). And yet, when I give her even the slightest attitude, it’s like the end of the world.

Of course, I don’t really mean what I said in the title I’m just really pissed off and trying to avoid her around the house.",3,3,1747489441.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kotc17/im_starting_to_hate_my_mom_not_really/
1kor95w,i don’t know what to do…,Comprehensive_Elk131,"this is not necessarily about me (23F) but rather my younger sister (17F) i’ll refer to her as K. Long story short, when she was around the age of 10 she got really cold to my dad. We didn’t understand why. She eventually told my sister (20F), i’ll refer to her as Y, that my dad had told her (K) not to tell anyone about when they were playing around. my sister Y (then about 13) didn’t know what to do so she went and told me. i asked her (K) what happened. K said they were playing around and he was tickling her and then he kissed her. but later told her not to tell anyone and it freaked her out. K said it was simply a peck and it only happened that once. my dad has always been an affectionate person and a small peck was normal as a child but it had always been innocent affection. obviously it didn’t continue after we got older. we all got together as a family and talked about this. my dad said the reason he said to not say anything was because he noticed K’s reaction was starting to become more of something “stimulating” to her so he stopped and didn’t want to make it embarrassing to K. he didn’t think too much of what he said.

as time went by, everything was back to normal. K and my dad’s relationship looked unaffected. though the possibility of that happening was always at the back of my mind from that point on and it really affected me. he never gave me a reason to think he did it on purpose before or after the incident. it made more sense it was miscommunication.

as my K got older, she started to be more secretive and never spoke to us about her thoughts, friends, or school. eventually we got a call from her high school that she got expelled after being caught vaping in the classroom. that was something unbelievable to us. Y and i were always calm and responsible, getting anything lower than a B was disappointing to us, let alone expelled. K was grounded and expelled for a week. K brought up the incident again, saying that what my dad did to her affected her. we spoke about it again and it seemed like we reached the same conclusion as before. he apologized and said he never meant for something like that to happen and make her feel like he was doing harm to her. 

K returned back to school but it made us question who she truly was. 

eventually through mutuals, Y was told that K had a boyfriend. we assumed K was embarrassed to tell us (since Y and i never had a relationship before) so we just kept quiet and waited until K felt comfortable enough to tell us. 

as K’s punishment for not doing well in school, my mom took away her phone. on there, was conversations with her boyfriend. an entire different person was in her phone and school. in her gallery we found nudes both of K and her boyfriend that they would send each other. there was conversation to her friends about them (K and her bf) skipping school and having sexual interactions in our family car (she drove herself to school in). it wasn’t having a boyfriend that we were worried about but rather how she was going about it. my parents were never strict with us in that aspect either. Y and i never were in relationships as a personal choice. however, K being secretive about it, sharing what is essentially child pornography, skipping school to goes god knows were, was what was wrong. they thought it was best to pull K out of school and do it online. her phone was taken away at first but eventually it was given back in short periods of time.

once again after looking through her phone we saw K was texting her boyfriend. honestly, didn’t really mind much since it was expected. however, it was disappointing since we offered her to meet with him in a public setting (as couples her age should be doing) but she refused and just kept contacting him secretly again. in those messages her boyfriend said that he was “mad that she is dealing with your moms emotional decisions” meaning that K’s punishment was simply do to my mom being “emotional”. essentially saying she (K) did no wrong. 

in that same conversation K said she will try to do something about my parents allowing her to go back to school the last week before summer break. later that day she was crying and when asked what was wrong she would say “nothing”. K spent the entire next day in bed sleeping and crying. eventually my mom got sick of her acting that way since it felt like it was a tantrum to let her go back to school. and in that confrontation she brought back the incident with my dad. saying it has affected her and that her friends and boyfriend are the only ones to make her happy. she continued to say that she never opened up to my sister (Y), my mom, and i was because we didn’t believe her when my dad did that to her. in that i told K we did, that’s why we spoke as a family and confronted him about it at first and it was settled as a misunderstanding. then K goes on and says that he actually would put his knee between her legs and rock her back and forth. he would also make out with her. and that it wasn’t only once but it went on for a month before she told us. my heart dropped. 

this was entirely different than what she had told us first and it would change the entire event. i told this to my dad and as i was observing his reaction to see if it was true, it looked like his eyes looked hurt rather than panic. he maintained his story on it and said that he never did anything to her other than innocent playing. K then went “that’s all i needed to hear” and stormed off. when i asked her what she meant by that, K said he kept saying it was innocent when it wasn’t. that “i was ten and he knew better” and K wanted him to admit that he SAed her basically. my dad said he wanted to go back and avoid that entire situation from ever happening and even told her that if she truly felt that he had hurt her to call the cops on him and he would gladly go. he just didn’t want to see her suffering anymore because of him. when she denied doing so he even offered moving out. but again declined. we offered her a therapist and she hesitantly agreed.

this entirely changed our family forever. the father i know and grew up with would rather die than hurt us. he never once made me doubt his intentions toward us or anyone. he had always been an anxious man that couldn’t lie for his life because his anxious tics would give him away. his heart has always been pure and loving. my other sister agreed as well. so him doing this to her was something my mind couldn’t fathom. i’ve heard stories of families not being there for their children that were SAed and to “protect” the family essentially denied it happening. i didn’t want to do that to her. my mom said that although she loves my father, she will always love her children more. my father said the same and understood if we wanted to believe K entirely. 

i don’t know what to think. i don’t deny this affecting my sister but at the same time i feel like i know her less than my dad. had Y been the one to say this, id have no doubt. but K makes me question things. why did her story change? okay sure maybe she was scared or didn’t realize to mention it. yet why does she coincidentally bring this up when she’s in trouble? maybe her emotions are heightened and her emotions spill out? why would she ever lie about something this serious? is she willing to make this up for her benefit? i’m not so sure

1konost,Ive been giving my dad my entire salary for a year and now my family acts like i owe them everything.,Think_Region7531,"
I want to start by saying that I had an amazing childhood. My parents were loving, supportive, and did everything they could to give me a good life. I truly believe they were the best parents growing up. I’m not writing this out of resentment—I love them deeply. But our current financial situation has brought out behaviors that are breaking me down emotionally and financially.

For the past year, I’ve been giving my dad my entire salary—about $75,000 total. Every paycheck I earned has gone straight to him. I did this to help my family during a tough time. I never questioned it—I just gave. I thought it was temporary and that we were all in it together.

Now, as I finally start to ask if I can just keep my salary moving forward—not asking for anything back, just to regain control of my own income—my dad becomes angry and guilt-trips me. Every time I bring it up, he says things like:

“You’ve barely been helping for a few months and you want to act like you’ve done some big thing?”

It’s been a full year. I’ve sacrificed everything: my savings, my financial independence, and my peace of mind. And somehow, it’s still not acknowledged.

What makes this even harder is how my sister treats me. She’s the one who put our family into over $600k in debt from med school. Now she’s moved out, making money, and building a future for herself. She hasn’t contributed a cent toward helping our parents.

And yet, she expects me to keep giving. Whenever I ask to start keeping my own salary, she yells at me, cusses me out, and calls me selfish and ungrateful. She completely dismisses the fact that I’ve already given up $75k of my income and still acts like I’m doing something wrong by wanting to support myself. She makes me feel like I’m the bad one for simply trying to take care of my future.

I’ve also paid for most of my own education—my dad contributed around $15k, and I worked to cover the rest. Despite that, I’m the one expected to carry the financial burden for the family while being verbally attacked for asking to stop.

I’m getting married in 2026, and I have no savings. None. I’ve given everything I have, and now I’m about to start a life with someone I love from a place of complete financial powerlessness. My financial freedom has been stripped away from me, and every time I try to get it back, I’m made to feel like I’m betraying my family.

I know I owe my parents so much. I love them. But at what point does love and duty cross into sacrifice that no one even acknowledges? Why am I the only one expected to give up everything? And how is it okay that my sister gets to scream at me for even asking to keep my own money?

I’m tired. I feel invisible. I just needed to say it out loud. Has anyone else gone through this? How do you protect yourself when the people you’re trying to help don’t see what they’re taking?",26,40,1747468545.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1konost/ive_been_giving_my_dad_my_entire_salary_for_a/
1kon48n,My mom and my dad are getting back together after 9 years and I don’t know what to do,heaven_and_back_atl,"Well, im 16, 17 this year. My parents are 52 and 53. They separated when I was 7, but it wasn’t a normal separation, it was very traumatic. I’m not going into the details, but I had to move our since im 7 , 4 times, and change school, 8 times. My dad, I don’t like him, I hate him, he hurt me more than I can tell. Hopefully my mom got the custody of me full time, and I could go see my dad in the holidays, which as a child, I never wanted to. I could go years without seeing him, he blamed a 8 year old for never sending him message (he never sent me message either???). Anyway, now let’s go back to last year. I noticed visible change in my mom’s behaviour, her that always hated him and said he was a bad person and to be careful, started being mad at me for saying it. At first I thought she just made peace with the past and didn’t wanna talk about it, which I would have understood. But then I noticed they talked on the phone more and more, her attitude seemed, off.. weird. We we are at a village vacation (not sure how I say that sorry), and my dad came to see us there since it wasn’t far away that much, I saw then him kissing her on the mouth and I understood. I told my family on the mom’s side, only close one though. My grandma, and my cousin. I didn’t want to be a snitch, and I didn’t tell I was sure, I just wanted comfort because it made me panic. After, I talked to her about it, but I kept it subtle and she admitted it. I was mad about it but I kept it inside. Then, for the next two months of the summer; we tried acting like everything was ok (my grandma and me, because we went to my grandma’s house for the rest of the summer) , even though sometimes I asked her if we were going back to his house (she said to leave her alone about this) or to reconsider, which she said « im a grown adult » so, ok. By the end of August, she looked more and more pale and empty, she had to go to the hospital to get more therapy and meds. She then went to my aunt’s house that was in the next city, so not far away. A few days go by and then. My aunt found my mom, half dead. She did an attempt. She barely survived. I was completely.. shocked. We thought she wouldn’t make it but she miraculously did. Me that has diagnosed C-PTSD made is worse. I was so mad at my dad because in my head it was all his fault. After some days is emergency, she went to the psychiatrist hospital but they I don’t know how, let her out one day later. Then , until today, we came back to our appartement and my grandma is here full time to help my mom. At the beginning she said she wasn’t going to talk to my dad anymore, that she made a mistake and that’s partly because of him she did it. Then a few weeks later she changed her mind fully, saying the didn’t do anything attempt, she took too much by accident (yeah sure.) and that it’s not his fault. Today, we are moving out in the month near when my dad lives, we are waiting for the results of where she will work (she is a teacher, and did wishes near where he lives). So this is it. I’m tired. And she knows we can’t live with him we have 3 cats and my dad HATES cats. Yeah that’s it.

1komda2,My boyfriend's family?,OpportunityOk7758,"My boyfriend's family

Hi me [23F] and my boyfriend [28M] have been together since December 2020. 
We startes living together after 1 week, I did not know basically anything about his everyday life. How we decided to get together is a whole another story and is the end result of multiple other experiences in my past etc. 
So we started living together at his location which is near his whole family. And by near I mean that we see his father, mother, grandpa and grandma almost every day. They also have a family business together.
What is very weird to me is how these people here are. His parents just started to get a little comfortable with me and it's been 4 freaking years. They are very insecure people. In this part of our country the people are very jealous. They think only about what other people think. They have extremely closed mindset. Which is annoying and frustrating for me considering that I study philosophy, I have used drugs, I love partying, I am an adventurer by soul, my boyfriend understands those things and we are both good with them. Never mind that, I am raised to be good to people and I am really trying to be nice and kind and good because they are family and I want to have a good connection with them. 

But his parents and his sister and his whole family they are just ungrateful. 
I'm not going to go into detail about what I've done for them and how their respond I will just share basically how they act which for me is absolutely ridiculous. 
His sister has prom next month and she is absolutely ungrateful. Yesterday we tries to talk with her and her boyfriend about gifting them plane tickets for Rome which will be worth around 300 euros. And they started acting like we (me, my boyfriend, and his parents) should pay for their hotel too because it is embarrassing to gift something for prom for 300 euros. 
I just went crazy to be honest for me this is absolutely unbelievable and ungrateful and shit. 
His (my boyfriend's) parents are just as crazy and ungrateful. They always act as if I haven't cook or done anything nice and they will never say, thank you or ""it was delicious"" if I cooked something and I know I cook good. 
They never say ""I love you"" to my boyfriend and they almost never support him
I am just going out of my mind. My own family is not like them, my parents are very caring and they never act like that with us as a couple. 
My boyfriend tells me not to care and that they do not deserve my emotions and energy and I should not worry about them. Basically he is on my side, he sees that they are not acting normal. 
And I actually do care about them. I care that there is tasty food, that we do good, that we are happy and we have a decent present for his sister and her boyfriend for prom, or anything like that because that is how I'm raised and at the end of the day it is really nice when the whole family is good and we understand each other but with them.. It is never the case. 

I'm just really thinking of not talking to them the same way anymore and not talking to his sister for a while because this is ridiculous for me. She called her brother (my boyfriend) ""idiot"" because of those tickets and hotel yesterday and she said to us not to go to her prom. I just really want her to understand that this is not normal behavior for an 18 year old and that words have consequences. All those tiny scandals have built something in me for the last 4 years that really affects my relationship with my boyfriend. I am not even happy because of those things. It's really frustrating. 

Do you have any advise how can I cope with those people and get back my happiness in my relationship? Basically my question is - how can I deal with this so that I can feel better with myself because I can not change anyone and my boyfriend knows that those people are unchangeable and they are not worth worrying about emotionally. How can I safe myself from taking those things too personally? I just want to not give a shit about their stupid thinking and problems.",1,2,1747463170.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1komda2/my_boyfriends_family/
1kol5ho,My mom is never satisfied,regrettableredditor,"Long post, sorry.   
  
I'm 30f, my mom is 62f. We had a TERRIBLE relationship from my teens through early twenties, but have worked very hard to repair our relationship the last five years to pretty great success. 

It's relevant to note that recently I had a huge mental health crisis which resulted in me moving back in with her. I was jobless at first, but got one and I am working hard to not need financial help and contribute how I can until eventually moving out again. So far its been 90% great.

What is baffling me is my mom's semi-regular insistence that we have a ""shallow"" relationship and that I am the one stopping us from going ""deeper."" 

Examples I have given her to demonstrate this is ridiculously far from the truth:

I called her sobbing and asking for advice when I was losing my mind earlier this year, something I would have never done even a year ago. I sought and took her advice re my last break up and kept her updated to an extent I never have before. We talk about my career, my mental health triggers, my insecurities and pet peeves. I recently expressed my lack of direction and frustration with my mental health, so much so that she connected me with a life coach! We argue passionately about politics, we recommend and discuss books with each other, we even disclosed how much debt we're each in and promised to push each other to save and pay it off. 

And I try very hard to support her equally, since we are now both adults. She frequently vents about her micro manager boss, talks to me about squabbles with friends and her sister. She'll occasionally disclose marital concerns she has and listens to my advice. We frequently talk about her childhood and past experiences. I notice when she's in a weird mood and ask her about it. I make very intentional effort to make her feel special and give her well-thought out gifts any chance I can. 

But she does this very frustrating thing of approaching me super randomly with really loaded questions. ""What made you cry today"" ""Do you feel like you have anything to offer to the world? Do you think you are worthless?"" ""What is disappointing you, what do you want to change about yourself?""   
Sure, these are great questions to ask, but not just as I'm finishing dinner, or telling a lighthearted story about friends or my work day. 

Today, I cracked. She did it again after I noticed she was frustrated about something. She asked me if I have no self confidence and don't value my time, and when I got upset that she wasn't taking my word that I DO value myself, she came back with the ""you always shut me out because you don't want a deep relationship with me"" bit. 

  
Turns out me coming to her in crisis is not enough. She doesn't think the above examples ""count"" because I'm not coming to her ""before"" a crisis happens. It's true that in my teens and early twenties I never ever confided in her for anything. She will not let it go. I seemingly cannot change her mind that I purposefully hide my life from her. Despite me now living with her and seeking her out when I'm dealing with something. In a shameful moment, I ended up yelling ""just fucking listen to me!"" at her. Now she won't listen to a thing I say because I need to calm down (fair). I'm ashamed I yelled, but I'm at my wits end . 

How can I make her see that she IS getting the deep and personal connection she insists she isn't? I cannot give her anything more because I already share pretty much everything with her!! She keeps pointing to our past as if the last several years of growth haven't happened. It's so frustrating, because every time I think we've put the subject to rest, she pulls the same weirdly loaded questions two weeks later and is upset I may not be in the headspace to dive in or that I do not agree with her assessment that I suffer from low self-esteem. 

TL:DR, I am offering all I can emotionally and with vulnerability to my mom, and she is not satisfied and wants MORE connection, and refuses to acknowledge how much better we are doing in recent years. ",2,3,1747458408.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kol5ho/my_mom_is_never_satisfied/
1koku7i,being lied on despite only trying to help :/,Aexva,"i’m sorry if this isn’t allowed here, i just want some opinions or maybe some words of advice and encouragement, because im genuinely terrified for my safety. 

my mother and her husband had to drive to his homestate to help his elder mother who isnt faring too well currently. i was the only one who stepped up to come to their place to help with their pets, as my uncle also lives here, and needed the help as well. here’s the issue with that. he’s a really ugly alcoholic and had to promise my mother to not drink hard liquor while im here helping (that’s only fair, right? he’s fine on normal beer). he broke that promise the first day of me being here, with the neighbors being the enablers. i promptly had told my mother as he’s going behind her back, and blatantly disrespected me in the process. he called me a rat, a snitch, and basically made it so i was terrified of ever speaking up against it. he proceeded to buy himself and the neighbors dinner, while i sat by and watched…then he passed out with food around him and left me to handle everything. that’s been a common theme since i’ve been here. (got here tuesday 5/13). last night, he had two separate neighbors buy him liquor, and i had my sister come by and help me take care of the animals because im not in good health and i was beginning to feel faint while drenched in sweat. he didn’t take too kindly to this and proceeded to ignore me, pass out, leaving me to take care of the entire house and being foot harassed by a puppy. he cooked my mothers food that she bought to help me out, for my neighbor to have for his dinner. leaving me with cold sad left overs. i called my mother and let loose, basically spilling everything that’s gone on. he’s thrown the puppy by the collar, watched while i nearly passed out drenched in my own sweat (im in long term endometriosis treatment and im on meds that put me in early menopause, im only 22), while asking if i cleaned the floor yet, told my mother he’s the one doing everything and im just being lazy and sitting around (….which…no?), lied to her and said he went with his son earlier and while this was going on, which also no, because my sister was actively hanging out with his son. also never ever helping me out with the things i was promised help with, and, more times than once, stepping in pet waste because he leaves the dog outside for 2 mins at most. i explained a million times im not trying to cause issues and im only here to help, but now im just at the point where im in fear for mine, and these animals immediate safety, but i have no grounds to call the cops because its only been backhand bs. 

i’m really sorry for the long post. 
here’s a tldr: mom and husband went out of state to help his mother in poor health, i came to help my actively alcoholic uncle with my moms pets, to then be called names, be treated as if im a subhuman slave, and to be told i’m lazy and a slob when im doing everything on my own with him passed out all day from drinking. 

- any words or advice will help, i feel so alone right now and i don’t know what im doing wrong. feels like im the scum of the earth for wanting my mother to know the truth and to stay true to my own morals.

For reference he is about to turn two and I have never taken him to the er. Never have I seen my son’s behavior so off. Never so lethargic. At the hospital my husband was dismissive, passive aggressive, refused to help me with our son and arguing with me while our son was inconsolable and I was trying to console my son.

1kojg22,My child is 2 1/2 years and my mother has never came to see her in person.,Royal_Prior_4998,"I’ve experienced a lot of emotion over this the past few years. Sadness, loneliness, anger, and lately I’ve ignored it. However, I’m having another baby soon and it’s triggering the anger and hurt I’ve once felt. 

I live in Florida. Most of my family lives in Chicago. My father, and sister have came to Florida multiple occasions to meet my daughter. However, my mother won’t. She’s in great health, I have offered to pay for her flights and even a hotel if she wanted to come with her boyfriend of 4 -5 years. I have solely driven to Tennessee with my daughter to visit my brother but Chicago is just too far and I have not had the opportunity to fly to visit in a while. 

My mother was unemployed for years so time was not a factor up until recently and now she has summers off as she works for a school district. I am due in June and I have asked her to come down to Florida but she will just completely ignore me, shrug, or make an excuse every time. I told her I’d pay! She has never done anything for my child but all I want her to do is come see her. We FaceTime every week and still have a strong relationship despite this all. After having my first child, I did cut communication off with her for a few months. I feel like doing the same this time. 

I feel like she’s been so dependent on others for years and doesn’t know how to be her own person. If her boyfriend isn’t holding her hand, she’s not willing to do most things on her own. My father and her are divorce and when my dad came to see my daughter, my mother was upset that she wasn’t “invited” to fly with him. Her being upset I feel like was bs just someone else to put blame on other than herself. 

Anyways, what would you do in this situation? Cut communication, accept what’s given, ect.? ",7,4,1747452370.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kojg22/my_child_is_2_12_years_and_my_mother_has_never/
1kojfsv,I (F28) feel trapped in a toxic family dynamic and need advice on setting boundaries without abandoning my grandmother.,mamakoblue20,"Hi Reddit, I really need some advice.

I’m 28F, Filipino, and as many of you know, family ties in our culture run deep but sometimes, they can be too much. I feel like I’m drowning in responsibilities and guilt, and I don’t know how to move forward without hurting the people I love.

Some background on my family:

My grandmother had four children, three sons and a daughter.

* My dad (currently on his third wife) is a good provider and supports many of us financially.
* One uncle has passed away.
* The other uncle is decent and stable but married the rudest woman I’ve ever encountered.
* My aunt (the main issue here) never finished school and once said she thought they’d “be rich forever” due to a family business in the 90s that eventually went bankrupt. She married a very rude man, and they have a daughter who is likely autistic but has never been diagnosed because they’re in denial.

From them, I have several cousins—most are working and living independently in different cities. One is a bank employee, another is an executive, and one is an HR head. I also have a younger brother (24M), who works at an office and lives with me.

Here’s where the problem begins:

In 2019, my brother, my grandmother, and I moved to a different city for a fresh start. We live in a cramped 1-bedroom apartment.

* My grandmother and I share a foldable queen bed.
* My cousin (the autistic one, now in her 30s) sleeps in the spare bed that belonged to my late uncle.
* My brother sleeps in the living room.

A few years ago, my aunt and uncle sent their daughter (my cousin) to live with us because they “couldn't afford her.” They still live rent-free in my grandmother’s house and only cover food, water, and electricity.

Here's the catch:

* My dad sends them money every month (without realizing my grandmother also sends them money from our allowance and her pension).
* When my dad found out they were double-dipping, he was shocked.
* My cousin (the one living with us) used to work before moving in, but now does nothing except lay in bed, maybe wash dishes occasionally, and talks about marrying rich instead of getting a job. My grandmother gave her my late grandfather's pension and she claims it every month.
* Worse, she’s rude to my grandmother when my brother and I aren't around and even does things that put her in danger.

My concern now: My dad is nearing retirement, and my grandmother is getting older. What happens when they can’t support my aunt and her husband anymore? When will my aunt take responsibility for her daughter? Why are they relying on an 83-year-old woman to care for a grown adult?

And here’s my personal dilemma: I want to move out. I work from home, and I need space and peace. I told my grandmother that I plan to rent a place nearby so I can focus better, while still being close to cook for her, check on her during the day, and maybe even sleep over sometimes to help her adjust. But the moment I brought it up, she went into full ""grandma drama mode"" threatening to move back to our hometown and live with my aunt.

I feel torn. She raised me and I love her deeply. I want her to have a safe and happy home. But I also need space to grow, especially as I near 30. Right now, I feel like I’m sacrificing my own well-being for people who aren’t even doing the bare minimum to help themselves or worse, who take advantage of her and my dad.

I don’t want to seem selfish, but I also don’t want to be stuck in this cycle. I need advice on how to set boundaries, care for my grandmother, and also start living my life.

1koi6yq,Is it weird to still be afraid of my dad sometimes?,Inevitable-While-141,"When I was maybe 4 or 5, however far back I can remember, I was pretty attached to my dad. I would always stay by his side when he wasn't at work, follow him around, etc. But, whenever I'd pester him for something I wanted, as a child of course often does, or talked out at a bad time, it wasn't rare that'd he'd lash out at me. Not yelling, but in this sort of condescending way that made my toddler brain think that I was completely in the wrong, no matter why he was mad. But, more often then not from what I can recall from back then, he'd end up in a different conversation with another adult and act casual and almost cheery. I get that it's polite to not let your anger out on uninvolved people, but did this fuck me up? From those distant memories, I'm still afraid to talk back to my dad when he gets irritated in an argument, even if I'm certain I'm right. Even if his temper is usually much better than back then with me, it still scares me whenever I notice the first signs of anger from him. Is this normal? Also, sorry if this isn't really an appropriate subject for the subreddit.

1kohpva,Im pregnant and my family makes no effort to see me but I am expected to come to them.,AdAccurate9267,I have an up and down relationship with my family. Never talk about feelings and growing up could not express my feelings with many other issues involved. I am an adult now and struggle mentally with many issues due to this. I am pregnant with my first child and I like a little over an hour away from my family. My sister is the favorite and it shows. Lots of effort has been made for her when she lives over two hours from them. My mom makes comments all the time about me moving back but I would never do that. My mom constantly made comments about me getting pregnant and how she can’t wait everytime I would see her so I finally ended up pregnant and now that I am it’s a different story. I am seen her once since pregnant and that was with me driving to their house all for me to get into an argument  with my dad less than 1 hour of being there and was told to leave. We live in an old house that requires a lot of work and we are trying to get stuff done before baby comes because right now the baby room is a storage room so we are trying to remodel for more closet space etc so many projects going on. I told mom I really needed to stay home for Mother’s Day so I could work and get this done before I’m too big and miserable to help out and now I feel like she being petty. Two days after Mother’s Day I saw on the location tracker (she tracks everyone in the family) that her and my dad were in my city shopping. I didn’t say anything because they normally will come here and not tell me they are in town or see me so nothing new there but I saw them drive by my work twice and didn’t bother to stop by and say hi. Or ask me to lunch because I saw they had lunch here also. They don’t even know what I look like pregnant at this point and it really hurt my feelings that they couldn’t spare 5 mins just to say hey. They always ask me to come there but will not see me when they come here. Makes me feel guilty but that just doesn’t seem right. My mom says she wants to come stay with me after I have the baby to help but they never check on me or anything so I really just don’t even want her help at this point. I have alot going on and I’m stressed and I feel like they think I’m the selfish one for not traveling to see them when my mom doesn’t work anymore so like why can’t you make time for me when you are where I live. ,2,2,1747446633.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kohpva/im_pregnant_and_my_family_makes_no_effort_to_see/

My girlfriend is having a stressful life lately, with lots of problems.   She's stressed and extremely anxious.

She has also  been feeling sick with pneumonia for a few weeks.   Recently she's been feeling better, except she gets shortness of breathe


Starting last Saturday  she began taking antibiotics for pneumonia.  She needs to take 3 pills a day.  Last night she took her pills and drank 8 beers with an empty stomach.   

She stayed in the backyard with the dogs while she was drinking.   I was watching TV,  she came to the bedroom really different.

She wanted to sleep but her eyes were rolling in back of her head as she layed in bed.  She was freezing, with shortness of breathe.   She got up to pee and fainted in the washroom.  she woke up and begged me not to call 911.

She was Freezing and then she was sweating so much.  

She was laying in the bed almost hallucinating,  talking by herself.   Her eyes were closed while having a conversation with her dead grandmother.   She kept moving her hands,  and she even forgot who I was.

It's like she was possessed or high on crack. (IM NOT BEING SARCASTIC) 

I was panacking,  until she fell asleep.
She doesn't remember anything today.

Could this have been pills mixed with alcohol

1koh4id,My mum treats me like a maid and says horrible things,InterviewInside5415,"Hey, I don’t really know how to begin this, but I just need to vent and maybe get some advice if anyone’s been through something similar.

Lately, my mum’s been treating me like I’m just here to clean, cook, and serve everyone — like I’m not a daughter but a maid. She constantly says hurtful things like *“you’re not going to uni,”* *“you don’t even deserve anything,”* or *“everyone agrees you’re the problem.”* She compares me to others, says I’m lazy or useless, and I swear sometimes even her voice feels like it’s stabbing my brain — that’s how much I associate her with pain now. Honestly i am exhausted,i have had enough of her insults and Even when I try to focus on my studies and tell her I’ve done my work, she shuts me down and says *“no you haven’t even done anything.”* It’s like she never believes me. She doesn’t give me the space or peace to study, and whenever I try to have a little time for myself — like sitting down or going on my phone — she makes me feel guilty. She’ll say things like *“go do something,”* or *“you’re wasting time.”* I literally can't even breathe or exist without being criticized.

Even when I try to set boundaries (like saying I’m tired or don’t want to do something), she flips it on me and says I’m disrespectful or ungrateful. And then she says things like I should do uni on my own with loans because I “don’t know how to speak to my parents.”I don’t feel safe in this home. I feel like I’m just here to serve and be insulted. I get so angry and hurt that I feel like screaming or running away. it hurts that the people who are supposed to support me are the ones tearing me down. I try my best, I really do — and I’ve always had good intentions — but it’s like nothing I do is ever enough.

I’m scared, overwhelmed, and honestly tired of pretending I’m okay when I feel like I’m falling apart. It feels like no one in my family ever defends me, and I don’t want to grow up carrying this pain. I just want freedom, peace, and to be loved without being used or guilt-tripped.

1kogmqp,"Adult children of broken family situations, how do you cope?",BeneficialVisit8450,"Gosh that sounds so weird

Quick story: I’m 19F, and grew up in a divorced family. Mom would have us on the weekdays and dad would have us on the weekends. While it may seem simple, it was a stressful process for us.

To put it into terms, imagine this: You’ve JUST gotten used to living at mom’s. It was stressful first adjusting since there were so many rules, but now you’re okay. You’re actually starting to LOVE this place, as it’s where all your things are, where you go to sleep, where you wake up. The thought of home is now a relaxing area, but you don’t get to stay there for the weekend like you hoped, you don’t get a choice. 

You have to instead sleep in a home where every week, how used to it you are gets reset. It’s a completely different world: Your room is bare, no homemade food because the fridge is full of your dad’s food(and half of it is expired), no rules, and for some reason, you feel sick when you come here. BUT! Just when you were getting used to that, you have to go back to mom’s.

As a child, when I had to go back to my mom’s, I was always really annoyed and angered by her. We would have hour long arguments because she talked a lot more than my dad. We would have dinner together, have homemade food, rules would be enforced, and she would try to talk to me whenever she felt like it tbh.

My dad was the complete opposite. As a child, my anxiety took away my ability to advocate for myself with him. As a kid, I needed consistency for me to interact with people, and I would need years to feel comfortable with sharing my weaknesses with them. My dad was a kind stranger to me, I never knew him, and now it just feels too awkward to suddenly start talking. In addition, this was why if something was broken, if my clothes had holes in them, or if my conditioner was out, I just couldn’t tell him. 

It was so much for me now and it’s still so much for me now. My mom’s been frustrated with me cause of it, but her and dad don’t seem to get that this takes a tole on us from how much we’re having to switch when we never signed up for this. My brother has gotten better at it, but my dad still feeds him fast food even when he hates it. He tries to get him healthier options for his keto diet(he has seizures), but obviously that’s not going to be as healthy as homemade food. 

My mom placed the blame on me for buying cookies when I went to my dad’s house once because “when he looks in the cupboard that’s all he can see” but I feel like my dad is more at fault here for not having any good snacks for him. 
Not to mention, my mom is definitely a big coward when it comes to our dad. She says we have to tell him, but if he’s not gonna listen to her, then why would he listen to us? 

It’s why I’m staying at my mom’s this week. I just CANNOT take this amount of transition anymore. It’s like moving to the desert and the tundra every weekend…

1kogiym,Is a handmade baby blanket an appropriate gift to give an employee that is expecting a baby?,HypnosisPancakes,"I (32f) am in middle management of a small company and have a few staff that I work with and oversee. One of them ‘James’ (fake name) is welcoming his first baby with his wife within the next 2 weeks. 

For context I’ve worked with James for the last 4 years, and would say we are friendly at work, and he has spoken with me a bit about his excitement and nervousness about becoming a parent- and I have tried to offer advise as someone who has worked with babies in my career and has helped raise my siblings. 

My team and I are all very excited for him and his wife. We all chipped in to give them a gift card so they could purchase some baby items to get ready for the new arrival. 

I knit and crochet as a side gig, but also volunteer my time to make blankets for NICU babies, and other items for hospital patients. 

This is where I need advice. I was thinking of gifting my coworker and his wife a crochet baby blanket. I have a few that I was either going to sell or donate, so it’s not an issue of time.
I will admit I am not always the best at social ques, and have heard both arguments that gifting a handmade item would be nice, but on the other hand, unless an item was specifically requested, it’s not always a good idea to gift knit or crochet. 

I’ve asked for my husband’s perspective, what would he think if his boss (a woman if that matters) gifted him a handmade blanket if we were expecting… he says he would appreciate the gesture and find it really sweet of them. 

My Mother and MIL say it might be cute….. but that it’s really not appropriate, as handmade items are best left to close family members and to leave it at only the gift card. 

So, would it be appropriate to gift a crochet baby blanket to a coworker that is welcoming a new baby soon? Or would it be too personal for a boss to give their employee?

I want the use of this money to go to something good and not just be blown. I feel like ever since finding out I was the sole beneficiary they are acting bitter towards me. I don’t plan on keeping it all to myself but I’m worried simply giving them money isn’t going to fix the issue and bitterness they have towards me already.

1kobu3v,Am I being guilt tripped?,ThrowRA_lucky76,"I (25 F) am 36 weeks and 5 days pregnant with my first baby. My mom (46 F) lives 2.5 hours away and graduates tomorrow (1 hour further). I am unsure if I should make the drive or not. My mom has always been there, shes shown up for everything whether is be big or small my whole life and has especially went all out on celebrating any type of success (throwing parties/showers, etc). Over the last two years my mom has become a bit more selfish and in her own bubble compared to how I’ve been raised. Her and my Dad moved back to our hometown and this is where things started to change. She enrolled in college and is managing to graduate with her bachelors in a years time and has already accepted a new role. The thing is she isn’t just being selfish in a way of living her life she’s almost completely disregarded situations my siblings and I have went through and seems to only be putting forth effort based on obligation. I’m not faulting my mom for this as she quite literally gave her life to her kids but it is a hard adjustment out of no where. My parents raised my siblings and I to be very independent so I’m not referring to financial situations or physical help of any sort - more so just being there mentally/verbally as a mom would. My older sister went through a divorce and that’s when things started to be seen that our mom just wasn’t acting how we’re used to. Since starting school she has quite literally sent every grade she’s made and boasted herself for making the deans list/honor roll etc. She even went as far as submitting herself into the local newspaper. She is walking in her graduation and my dad wanted to throw her a grad party (as she’s always done us). I helped him get all the necessary things such as decorations and planning out food. I went to the OB today and my doctor recommended no travel 3 hours away or more. Well I already didn’t want to go. My body is uncomfortable and changing constantly. I feel as if I’m choosing to go bc I know the raft I will get later will be pure hell. Although it would passive behavior I know my mom will feel a certain way. She’s made comments about us kids not being so cheerful over her success.

I feel like if I don’t go it’s not bc I’m choosing what’s best for myself and my baby but out of selfishness where as if I do go it’s more so obligatory bc I have a million and one things to do with 3 weeks (hopefully) left before my first baby is here.

1ko8w1a,i fucking hate my brother,the_outsiders1989,"my brother is HORRIBLE to not only me, not only our family, but EVERYONE he meets. he’s 12, and i’m telling you right now, i have never seen an egg so rotten.

he’s failing all of his classes, he’s always in ISS/OSS, he’s ridiculously disrespectful to EVERYONE he meets, he’s selfish, and he’s just straight up rude.

i’m honestly getting to the point that i can’t handle it anymore. my brother knows i struggle w severe depression, n his favorite thing to do is when he’s mad at me to bring up my absolute worst insecurity: my weight.

my brother acts like he’s so tough and so bad, but he’s a fucking WIMP. if he were to try and throw hands w me, he’d be on the ground in half a second.

and the worst part?

everyone sides w him.

“you’re the older sister, you should know better” “be the bigger person” “he looks up to you” “be a leader, not a follower”.

i don’t want to be a fucking leader to a shitty little kid who can’t shut his fucking mouth.

i would give ANYTHING for my brother to leave me alone.

and on top of that, he’s crazy. he threatens to kill people ALL THE TIME, and if he doesn’t like someone, he will try to beat your ass.

the funniest part about that is that he expects me to stick up for him when he’s being the asshole in the situation.

he expects me to fight his battles that HE’S caused. my dad tells me to as well. 

when i tell you my dad crashes out if i don’t protect him w every bone in my body, he CRASHES OUT. 

he wants me to be there for him, and protect him, and do everything for him. i do everything for everyone else. i’m a severe people pleasers, and those who are people pleasers, you understand how exhausting it is.

i’m so sick and tired of my stupid ass little brother being favored over me and getting everything he wants.

i’m fucking done.

TLDR: my brother is a brat and gets everything he wants.

1ko88qa,I am tired of my dad.,ParticularWinter3738,"ps my dad is 49 and my mom is 47)

My dad is just a bum , i tried so hard to not think this way BUT. And i am just so SICK of it.

HE has the mind of a child, i resent him .  
for some info.

My mom starts to work at 7:30 in the morning while finishing around 9:30 and sometimes even till 11:30 pm. I can only help my mom in the after and night die to school. And when exams are vry near i dont have the time to help her. We do have a helper but he helps in exchange for his free of cost stay in the house.

Anyway while my mom is working and studying because my dad insisted she continue her studies, my dad just lays in his room all day. He is also studying phd i think. While that may consume his time . It isnt a excuse for him to not ever help my mom 360 days a year. Mind you he dosent even clean our house, its either me or my mom that do it. The only time he cleans is when he suddenly has a burst of energy. And the thing is my mom works right DOWNSTAIRS too, so distance isnt even the issue here.

Today i had a semi fight with him about this, and his response to me saying that my mom is gonna divorce him was that quote on quote “ them do it, the two of you go away, i will stay in this house alone”. I was just so disgusted and disappointed that rly….

i just want some advice or anything. This is all so mentally taxing for me.

My dad has always been more of the book smart and not the street smart, so he has been the one incharge of my studying, always taking me to wherever for my education , and i do love him but i love my mom too.

its just idk for me

TL;Dr 

basically my dad is a bum who never helps, while my mom pays the bills, does all the work. my dad who i think is sick of our complaints, said that we my should divorce him so me and my mom can go away while he lives in the house alone.

1ko4q23,I don’t want to carry this generational burden anymore.,Hidden231,"I don’t know if anyone else can relate to this, but I just needed to get it off my chest.

My father is the eldest among his siblings — four sisters and a brother. He basically gave up his entire life for them. His dreams, his education, everything was put on hold so he could work odd jobs and support them when the family was struggling financially. He even took loans to get his sisters married and worked hard to pay off the debt.

Now, those same sisters, who are comfortably married into wealthy families, treat him like trash. They talk to him rudely and show him zero respect. What hurts me more is how they treat me and my sister — like we’re beneath them or not worth their time. My grandfather passed away a long time ago, and my grandmother takes her daughters side no matter what, so my dad is always left out or disrespected.

And now, I feel like the same cycle is happening to me.

I’m the eldest daughter, and ever since I can remember, I’ve been expected to take care of my younger sister. But she talks to me like I mean nothing. She’s acts like she doesn’t have to value anything I say or do for her. And the worst part? When I try to call her out or scold her, my father sides with her and says things like, “This good-for-nothing girl is fighting again over small things.""

I feel invisible, unheard, and unappreciated — just like my father was. It’s like being responsible automatically means you don’t get to have feelings. That no one sees your sacrifices or cares about how you’re treated. I’m just tired. I don’t want to carry this generational burden anymore.",35,7,1747411773.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ko4q23/i_dont_want_to_carry_this_generational_burden/

My dad was talking to the ladies at the front desk about my glasses, how much, is it repairable?. All is well and everything turned out good.  it had been a long day and dad was stressed and wanted to come with me while I did what I needed for the day. 

Then out of nowhere he starts talking about how I don't drink, don't smoke, no relationships, blah blah, I collect everything and I have autism and sharing everything about me which he says that I should keep to myself if I wanted to. I didn't ask him to share that and if course I was a little embarrassed..
Wasn't sure if he was doing it in a nice way to show his affection but for some reason he always does it when I'm with him.

then he said to me you don't want a boyfriend because of your sisters past relationships.
I always hate confrontation and just anything where there is down talking someone. I just said yeah, I didn't want to cause a scene. Especially when there are people who are next to me waiting and looking at glasses.

1ko4cbl,I don’t know how to feel about this,Jolly-Law4955,"So this all starts with my girlfriend and my relationship. I love her without a doubt, we’ve dated for almost 4 years now and we’re just now getting the chance to live together since she lives away and I’m going to be working in the area (NorCal) for a few months for school. My family (SoCal natives) seem to think that she’s trying to steal me away, they worry she’s going to “trap” me and get her pregnant (even though we have talked profusely about her fears of getting pregnant and dying, me getting a vasectomy and other options), they worry that I’ll never come to see them because she won’t let me or she’ll cause problems not letting me see them. My GF and I have talked about these concerns especially since removing her birth control due to some major hormonal and mental problems/spirals

Her family is from Latin America, and some of them worry about the prospect of her getting deported or having a kid that gets sent to the country and I have to follow them or something like that (which I don’t think can happen?). They also worry that the family will try to mooch off of me, since I do have a pretty promising future, even though her family owns multiple houses and literally are not poor.

It seems to me that their biggest worry is that they don’t feel like they “know her” like they do my sister in law, who’s been in the family for a decade, even though this seems unreasonable to me since she lives 6 hours away and has her own job and school.

These concerns were brought up to me in a conversation with one family member  
who said they have seen relationships like this before, where the couple is on the phone during the night while they sleep (some had a problem with this), she would cry when it was time for us to separate (because we would only see each other for a few days every couple of months), and another thing I can’t think of. 

I’m just so confused on how to feel, and wanted to know your guys opinion on this whole matter, thanks for reading.

1ko04ic,Family Room or Massive Master bedroom,Mermaid_At_Heart,"If you have kids I want to hear your thoughts on this home renovation: 

TLDR: If you had the option to make your attic into a family friendly rec/entertainment space for family movie nights or games OR adding a half level to your master bedroom with a larger walk-in closet, and oasis type ensuite. Which would you choose? 

For context the house is 2.5 stories, the attic is small but renovatable. The husband thinks we should open the staircase to the master bedroom (which doesn’t have an ensuite or walk-in closet right now) and create a beautiful get ready space. Basically our master bedroom would have a loft with ensuite and walk-in closet pretty dang cool. However, as much as I would love my dream bedroom, I think we should turn the space into an entertainment room. I’m thinking for family movie nights, have a projector, comfy seating, popcorn machine etc. We have a fair sized main floor with a nicely setup living room, which my husband says will be used more than an attic rec space. He also thinks I won’t like having the young kids playing all the way up in the attic while I’m on the main level. Basically he just feels like it won’t be used as much, and we’ll just default to the living on the main floor. 

Do you have similar spaces, and what’s the pros/cons?

1knyiy6,"I feel childish and petty, and I need an honest opinion from an outside perspective.",SakuraFalls12,"Okay so this is a long story, I'm sorry in advance.

I (24f) live 3 hours away from the rest of my family. Two days ago was my sister's birthday, she turned 23. She's autistic and mentally much younger. She has a difficult time regulating her emotions, especially anger. When she's angry or upset, it's entirely possible that she won't speak to us for days. Anything can set her off. And she's also extremely stressed and overwhelmed during holidays or birthdays, including her own.

That's relevant for the situation I'm about to describe.

Unfortunately, I was unable to attend her birthday, but I wanted to get her a present. She's super into all things Disney and magic. She also enjoys writing, especially writing herself as the main character in a story, but she can never finish any of them. So I'm thinking: I love writing too. How about *I* write a story about her as the main character in her own magical story? So that's what I did. I spent weeks on it, even made AI generated pictures ('cause I can't draw lol) so she can see herself in every scenario. At the end of the story, I included an envelope with a necklace that's supposed to be 'magical', to make her feel like she's actually a part of the world I created for her. I'm super proud of it! I think it turned out awesome. My mom absolutely adores it as well. She promised to record my sister's reaction and send it to me when she'd receive my gift.

So I received the video on her birthday. My sister's excitement seemed forced. Like she was acting. We can all tell when she's acting. I'd sent her 4 messages that day, first one obviously wishing her a happy birthday. She didn't reply all day. Later I learned that she was mad at me over something small that happened three days prior. She never thanked me for the present and she never let me know what she thought of it. And honestly, that saddened me. I put a lot of time and effort in that present, tailoring it to her wishes and making her the heroine in her own story. But then, I got mad, because this *always* happens. Her reactions to our presents are wholly depended on her mood. We're constantly walking on eggshells around her, just hoping we won't say or do anything to piss her off. And if she's mad for whatever reason, she turns into the most ungrateful, insufferable little brat.

So I sent her a message, telling her that it made me really sad that she couldn't be bothered to at least say thank you for the present. And as I was typing it out, I felt like the most childish person in existence... But I wanted her to know that, yes, we have feelings too, and it wouldn't kill her to be a little mindful about how she acts towards us as well and how her actions make us feel. This just makes me not want to participate in her birthday or get her a present ever again, knowing that it's not appreciated anyway.

So be honest: Am I childish? 

Side note: All of us (me, my mom and my other sister (21)) are in therapy because of the stress my sister gives us, and we're all trying to learn to deal with her autism. But my sister is *not* in therapy, and I think she should be, to learn to express her emotions in a healthy way and to not hold a grudge for literal days or even weeks. It's not just up to us to adjust ourselves to her.",4,4,1747395079.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1knyiy6/i_feel_childish_and_petty_and_i_need_an_honest/

Context:
My father-in-law cheated on my mother-in-law, but during the two years they were separated, he kept trying to maintain a relationship with her and made her believe he was still interested, while in reality he was still seeing the other woman.
My mother-in-law eventually met someone else and got married to him nine months later.
Recently, my father-in-law called us to tell us he’s getting married in August to the woman he cheated on my mother-in-law with.

My husband is going to his dad’s wedding because he says there’s no benefit in staying angry, and besides, his mom is already remarried.

I’m very close to my mother-in-law (she’s like a mom to me), and back when we found out about the affair, I was very vocal about the situation. I told my father-in-law that his mistress would never be welcome in our family, that I didn’t want to meet her, and I said a lot of other harsh things. I was very firm with him.

Now my question is: What would you do?
Would you go to the wedding and pretend everything is okay, even if you’re really close to your mother-in-law?

For context, my mother-in-law is still upset that he’s with that woman, and she’s started seeing a therapist since finding out her ex-husband is getting married.

1knrzgz,Aita de,joeytthegoat,"So I (33m) live with my fiancé (27f). We have 1 child. 

When we first met, we worked together, I lived 70mile each way commute to work, she lived in the local area. It made sense we purchased a property closer to work. 

I have a child from a previous relationship (still 70miles away) see child as much as possible, however, recently I’ve been struggling. 

I work full time, partner is part time. We are shift workers. So one of us is always home for childcare (for baby) and we get some time off together regularly. 
But, I feel like I don’t get any time to myself, I’m either working or looking after our kid. I hardly see my other child because the distance isn’t worth seeing during the school week, and I have to work weekends, or my partner works weekends and it’s not fair to take baby on 140 mile round trip. 

I don’t have any friends in this area either so evenings are off the cards, I don’t have any hobbies because I don’t have any time…. Also shift work means I can’t commit to any teams or anything like that for sports. 

I don’t even get half an hour to myself a day to walk the dog, because if the weathers nice she wants to come with me to let smaller child enjoy the outside (fair enough), but if the weather isn’t as nice she wants to take the dog because it “gets her steps in for the day”. 

Now I know this sounds like a typical “male” point of view, but, I’d like to point out the following:
Partner has family and friends in local area. So although she’s also looking after child on days off, she does in fact at least have people to go and see or people who visit or go for days out etc. I do not. 

It’s been weeks and the only people I’ve seen are work colleagues and my partner. 

Am I being ludicrous here? Aita? 
I just feel like this is just life now…

Further to this I’d like to add, getting married in October, but partner wants another child in the near future as well. I’m hesitant, why would I want another child to add to already only ever looking after one and never having time to myself. A toddler and a baby is just going to mentally destroy me. 

TL/DR don’t have a social life because of life in the way. Aita.

1knrui7,How can I stop stepdaughter from hurting our relationship,No-Coach7020,"This my 47F first post to Reddit tho I enjoy listening to many Reddit podcasts. I have been in a relationship with my SO 47M for 4 years. My stepdaughters 15F manipulation has been evident since early on. She didn’t like him seeing me and would tell him over speaker phone so I could hear to “GO HOME!” when he was at my house. Call crying and monopolized hours when he was with me (she was at her mothers per 2-2-3 custody agreement). When we moved in together she insisted my son 16M spend more time at his father’s house so she could have just her and her dad “like it used to be”. She was 13 by this time. My son’s arrangement did NOT change to accommodate her demand. When I got pregnant with our daughter 2F she refused to speak to me or see me for months. When she was born, SD initially showered her with affection then suddenly turned on her and refused to see her. The baby was a month old. She throws tantrums to get her way, fakes constant illnesses to stay home from school or get attention, ignores any request I make to do chores (dishwasher, clean her bathroom), tells her dad I’m mean to her and I scare her. I’ve never raised my voice to her or taken a single privilege away. I don’t buy her BS and she knows it. It really gets under her skin that it doesn’t work on me. There are too many examples to list. Think whiny, pouting, meltdowns you’d expect from a small child over EVERYTHING. I swear it’s just for the game. She doesn’t even care about most of the things she whines for. A funny example: I wanted the whole family to go to the city for the day. I really enjoy it. She carried on about how she was too scared, crowds made her anxious, the city is too loud. We didn’t go. A month later I had Taylor swift tickets……CURED. She was on the train and tromping thru the city with a smile. TS is magic I guess. 
The bigger problem is my SO capitulates to all of it. He denies it’s happening, lies to cover for her, blames me for being frustrated. He’s basically an accomplice. It’s fostered so much distrust towards both of them. Even my stepson 18M says the favoritism is so blatant and pervasive, Hes given up trying to change it. That’s heartbreaking. 
My SO is a good man and a good father. I can’t take the marked shift in the entire mood of the house when she’s here. I go to our bedroom to avoid interacting most nights. Weekends when she’s here, I dread. My SO’s best friends since childhood warned me. His brother warned me. I was still unprepared for how bad it would be. 
My question is, how can I change it? Has anyone successfully navigated a situation like this. Teenagers are tough. Blended families are tough. This is different. Shes calculating and intentional with what she does and her dad buys right into it. Any advice would be so helpful.

1knrcap,my (24F) mom told me I don't have to pay rent if I lose 20 pounds in 6 months,ummidko,"Since graduating college, I have been paying $500 every month to my mother for living in her house. My brother graduated last year and lives with us, he does not pay rent. 

She told me that if I lose 20 pounds in 6 months I don't have to pay rent anymore. Mind you, I'm 10 pounds overweight according to BMI. So yeah I'm not in the best shape but I'm not obese. I got angry with her, I thought the whole point of paying rent in the first place was because she needed the financial support, but her bringing weight into this changes things. I brought up that my brother only works 3-4 hours a day and doesn't pay rent, but she criticized me for bringing him into this. Meanwhile I'm working a demanding/low paying full time job, taking a college class, and currently working on med school applications. After telling friends about this, I've learned the ones who live with their family are not charged rent. 

My mom demanded for rent since I declined her deal and I told her I was not going to give her money until she apologized to me.  She completely shut me down and told me I was forgetting the promise I made to send rent money. I haven't talked to my mom in 2 weeks over this, we have always been close but it hurts that something like money is ruining our relationship.

We are both in college and are taking summer classes. Earlier this year my brother 20 was doing really well in life and we discussed him temporarily moving in for the summer so that he can get to meet friends and finally start college. My brother has struggled with my things in his life, bullying, his identity, suicide attempts, and has been spoiled a lot by my parents. He would regularly steal money and other nice things like speakers, or random things for money. He has always struggled to hold down a job and has had many ups and downs with betraying my family and breaking their trust. But he was doing well for a while, was holding down a job, and wanted to change his life. He also met a friend of mine and really connect with him and decided that he wanted to go to college. But recently, like 2 weeks before he was going to move in, everything has taken a turn to how he used to be. My brother stole money from my dad and my dad’s cat that i gifted to him. ( My dads cat got hit by a truck 2 years ago so i gifted him this cat from my fiances family) My brother also got fired from his job, and has been now on horrible terms with my mom and dad. He is still planning on moving in, but has been lightly trying to gaslight me here and there. I don’t know what to do, because i know he wants his life to change and be better, and i really think moving out of our home town would be good for him. I am scared that these recent events are going to blow up in my face when he moves in. I have summer classes and a job, and don’t have time to watch over someone all the time, and i don’t want my stuff or my cats or my money to be stolen. I thought my brother has grown out of these things and i feel like a fool. I love my brother and i want to help him, but i refuse to be a parental figure. I need to focus on college and i just don’t trust my brother anymore after all the recent events. What would you guys do? Do i give my brother a chance to prove himself? My fiancé thinks my brother should just wait and move up when he has a dorm like all other college students, but he’s leaving it up to me. My mom and dad are pressuring me to be a “parental figure” and let him move in, otherwise they think he will never actually go to college and stay job hopping. I’m just so lost and looking for any advice. Am i horrible to put myself and my goals above my brother and break his heart and tell him he can’t move in anymore? Do i take a chance on him and hope for the best? ",1,5,1747359803.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1knp7rp/do_i_let_my_brother_move_in/

1knojq5,3 ways to shift your entire family’s energy—in less than 10 minutes,Happy_Seesaw5032,"**Something Useful You Can Use Today**  
Making a quick shift in how your family interacts doesn’t require a 10-step system or a therapist on speed dial.

**What do you do to make quick shifts in your family?**

Here’s a 3-step formula we’ve been testing that creates a noticeable shift in energy and connection—in minutes:

1. **Shift Physiology**: Stand tall, breathe deeply, move. Energy changes when bodies change. Even voice tone shifts the vibe.
2. **Shift Focus**: What are you choosing to focus on? Frustration… **or the outcome you want**?
3. **Shift Language**: Swap “This is a mess” for “This is a challenge we’re learning from.” Language rewires meaning.

🧪 I’m now testing this process with other families.

I packaged it into a 1-hour PDF walkthrough. It's **totally free**—and if you try it, I’ll follow up with a quick questionnaire to learn what worked and what could be better.

💡 In just one hour, you’ll:

* Uncover your family’s core values
* Clarify key roles + reduce daily tension
* Set one micro-goal together

🔥 Your mission: Try it. Share feedback. Help us build the next version.

This isn’t a polished. It’s a real-time experiment. I’m looking for 10 families to try it and give feedback.

👉 If that sounds interesting check bio, comment or DM me. Happy to share more.

(And yep—this is part of a bigger platform we’re building to help busy families feel more connected, one clear step at a time.)",1,1,1747357737.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1knojq5/3_ways_to_shift_your_entire_familys_energyin_less/
1knnv5g,How do I reconnect with a half sibling?,WorldSuccessful1441,"I (15f) have a half sibling on my dad's side(Meadow, they/them) and I want to reconnect. My dad was married to a women before my mom and had a kid with her (meadow) after there divorce they split custody. My dad got married to my mom, and they had me and my younger sister. We grew up together (Meadow was 10 when I was born). My parents have told me a lot about how meadows mom made their life a NIGHTMARE. She'd call them in the middle of the night for no reason (especially on Valentine's Day), she'd never show up for meadow which bothered them greatly, she'd blame them for various things and yell at them, she'd control meadow and wouldn't let her(at the time,she/her) like girly things, and she'd slowly take meadow away from my parents. Somehow the court gave her more and more custody of meadow, so I saw her less and less. By the time meadow was 18 I rarely saw them. But I had good times with meadow, although I wish I'd had more. As soon as Meadow graduated they moved across the country to Oregon and we lost contact with them. (I was 8 when Meadow left) After Meadow left they video called once for Christmas, and texted once or twice than changed numbers. I fear Meadow doesn't want anything to do with us, I don't entirely blame them because of the messy upbringing. But I really really miss Meadow. I saw that they have/had a Facebook but I have no clue if they still use it. I don't know where they live exactly, and don't have they're number or email. I'm not sure if there's anything I could do.

1knlchk,Struggling with shame and fear about my tattoos. Seeking advice & support!,Old-Highlight-7134,"Hi, I’m 25 F, I got two large tattoos, my only two, about 6 months ago. I’m a white hispanic woman, I look early 20s, and I grew up under a pretty conservative culture and tattoos were always taboo. 

My parents still dont know, and they still make comments like “Tattoos are like billboards, it’s just advertising so how do people expect other people to not look at their tattoos and judge them?” … so obviously I’m never going to show them lol. But it’s becoming increasingly hard to hide since they’re on my lower arms. And I’m struggling with shame. 

And on top of that, seeing the news in the US frightens me. Tattoos are now being arbitrarily linked to gang activity or prison history by law enforcement as a hail mary attempt to deport people out of this country. I was born here, grew up here, and I’m still scared. I know I’m privileged as a white woman but as a hispanic and living relatively close to the boarder, I’m afraid. Even just having tattoos, I’m afraid this will give people a reason to treat me worse or I’ll have worse consequences than before. 

I want to keep my tattoos. I got them for myself bc I loved the artist’s work and I wanted to claim my freedom and do this for myself and no one else. But now I feel my values have been shaken and I’m weary of getting more tats even though I want them. 

Anyway, just wanted to see if any other tatted people are feeling this way. Only looking for support or advice on how to give less of a freak what other people think- thats why I got them in the first place. Life’s too short. Any advice on how to deal with my parents or this wave of hate and violence in the US is much appreciated. Thank u ❤️

TLDR; Scared of discrimination based on tattoos, and not sure if I should tell my parents about my tattoos bc they make me feel ashamed. Advice welcome, or just knowing I’m not the only one feeling this way. Thanks!",0,1,1747348209.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1knlchk/struggling_with_shame_and_fear_about_my_tattoos/
1knkld6,"Don’t want to enable my brother, but don’t want to lose him",EitherYou6124,"My brother (31M) recently asked me (25F) for money, and I’m certain it’s to support his drug use so I obviously don’t want to send him any.

They called him and said he’d upset me, but didn’t mention the money, hoping he’d be honest with them, he wasn’t.

The thing is I love my brother and aside from this our relationship is actually good, which is why this is so hard. A part of me just wants to send the money to keep the peace, but I know that won’t help him in the long run. I’m also afraid he’ll shut me out completely, thinking he can’t talk to me or ask for help with anything because I went to our parents, but if I don’t talk to them I feel like I have no one to turn to.

1knjgpe,AITA for calling the police on my aunt,mspancakee,5/14/2025. Earlier this day I (17) and my little sister(14) (cousin but we are very close) were walking down the street to her house to get one of her PlayStation controllers for me to use. As we are walking she explains to me she is upset because she wanted money to get Taco Bell delivered to my house (which is where she stays after school until my aunt gets off work at night) because she had been eating hotdogs since Monday and didn't want that anymore but our aunt told her no. She then started calling our mutual family members asking for the money and explaining the situation. Everybody she called said they didn't have it and some said they didn't want to make our aunt mad. I didn't think she should be calling everyone because later I knew she would get in trouble but I knew she would not listen to me. As time goes on we get back to my house and my aunt pulls at around 3:45(she has work at 4). She pulled up yelling at my little sister. Which I expected but I stayed in my room and just listened because I knew it was bound to happen. Until everything went quiet for a moment. My grandma who owns our house then steps in saying “Stop your hurting her”. Then I realize what's going on and I jump up with my phone in hand recording while walking to the guest room where they were. My aunt was choking her. She couldn't speak. She only got off my little sister when she realized I was recording just to tell me how much she didn't care. I then ran out of the house and down the street as fast as I could because my grandma was trying to stop me from calling the police. I got far enough to where she could not chase me and called them. My aunt was then arrested. My grandpa said what I did was wrong. Am I the asshole?,18,8,1747343303.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1knjgpe/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_my_aunt/
1knj5ms,I'm on the family vacation from hell.,Disastrous-Baker-351,"Im a 32 year old man and my boyfriend/fiance is 29. I moved away from home seven years ago to a different city and trying to have boundaries with my family has been difficult, particularly my mom. 

Its my dad's 70th this week and my family have taken us and my sister and her partner to Venice for 4 nights. It was his birthday yesterday and my mums 69th today coincidentally but the trip is mostly for my dad. We wanted to have some time to ourselves and not do EVERY SINGLE THING with my family. My mum said she wasn't expecting us to be together all the time so I thought it would be fine.

I was wrong. 

We arrived 2 nights ago and all went out for dinner. They had already decided where to go so we didn't have much say. They'd also already booked a table at a restaurant for my dad's birthday last night and my mothers tonight. Yesterday was my dad's birthday so we all had the morning together then me and my partner made our own way to the area we were all going to explore and tried to grab lunch just 2 of us. The second we sat down my phone my sister messaged me sending their location saying ""if you haven't ordered already, come here instead."" We went there to meet them for a drink and all spent the afternoon together until we made our separate ways back. I even felt weird about this at times like I couldn't relax properly. For dinner last night we all ate together then me and my partner went for a drink together, got a big table and the rest joined for the rest of the evening.

So yeah, so far some time just the 2 of us but also a lot of family time. Today its my mums 69th and we knew we'd all be spending the morning together to give presents etc... and then have dinner together tonight and drinks after etc. In the afternoon the others were planning on going on a 40 min boat trip to a smaller island and the 2 of us fancied having a few hours to ourselves like an actual stretch of time to do our own thing. I broached it with my dad this morning and he commented that my sister (?) wouldn't be happy. I then told my sister who was like ""wont mum be disappointed?'and she was then messaging me like ""have you told her yet?"" (I'm so sick of my phone and messages on this trip)

I had such anxiety about telling my mum. I eventually said to her we would quite like a few hours just the 2 of us and then we'll meet you after your boat trip. She seemed stunned and was like ""oh okay"" and walked away. About ten minutes later before we left i went to say goodbye and she had clearly been crying. I asked her if she was okay and she said (whilst starting to cry) ""No I'm quite hurt actually. Its a family holiday"" and i said ""yes I know, we'll spend lots of time as a family but we'd like some time to ourselves as well"" and she was like ""maybe if we were away for 2 weeks but its just 4 nights"" and then kept crying and then was like ""oh no you go away enjoy your day"" Etc and I just sort of sighed and left. My partner and I had a bit of a debrief/vent to my sister and her partner and they basically just took my mom's side. 

My partner and I spent the afternoon together and I was in a genuinely foul mood. My stomach was in knots. I had dread/anxiety about meeting up with them again and just how excruciatingly uncomfortable this all is. Its so frustrating because if they all just backed off A LITTLE everything would be fine. And id be in such a better mood and better company for family time etc... its like they don't seem to have the common sense to see that their demands/expectations are clearly pushing me away.

Its also now doubly uncomfortable because its now at the point where everything my family is doing is grating on my partner (and me to a lesser extent as I'm used to it) because its just so suffocating. They thankfully acted like nothing had happened when we all met up again but I'm dreading the following:

if my parents comfront me about it during the rest of the trip

if its brought up at some point in the future -my mothers 70th next year. She'll probably want to do a similar trip and God knows how I could ever get my partner to agree to go. If we tried some kind of compromise (staying in our own accommodation, setting boundaries early about having time to ourselves) it would cause world war three again. 

I don't feel caught in the middle exactly because IMO 90% of the problem is my mom's reactions to things and I mostly agree with my partner, but obviously it puts me in an awkward position when I'm having to have such uncomfortable conversations.

Please help.

I live with my 86 year old nan who is incontinent and cant look after herself, obvioisly this isnt her fault but all I smell is her waste as her bedroom is across the hall from mine and its where I am mostly when I am at home. I try and leave and go out as much as possible to get away from the smell, but its becoming too much.

Im 18 and still live with my parents and have no say in whether she goes in a home or not (my parents keep mentioning it but I doubt it will actually happen)

I started to feel ill a couple weeks ago, but only when I was at home and could smell it. I had to go into her bedroom this morning (somthing I havnt done in a while because I genuinly want nothing to do with her at this point I dont care how that makes me sound) as it was 4 in the morning and no one else was awake and she kept ringing people. She knows to ring me last if she needs somthing.

Anyway since then ive felt like im going to throw up and was wondering if its possible to become ill from being around the smell of someone's waste for so long, and if there is, is there anyway i can stop it? Its affecting my appetite and I never want to eat because its all I can smell.

Im running out of options and I cant leave the house more than I already do.

1kneett,What would you do if you found out the father of your child was looking at inappropriate images in front of your child?,apatheticHedgehog,"For some background my parents split up when I was 7. I lived with my mum but would often spend weekends with my dad I made a post on trueoffmychest talking in detail about what happened and have since told my dad what affect his behaviour had on me but things are still complicated between us. I've recently been wondering what would have happened if I told my mum what was happening at the time and what she would have done. I think I will ask her one day but was curious to see other parent's take on this.

My dad had a blog on tumblr that was just pictures of naked men that apparently had quite a lot of followers and he would spend a lot of time on it. Not really a problem but he would be sat next to 14-20 year old me either on his laptop or phone looking at these pictures and making no attempt to hide it from me. While it wasn't porn it made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't believe he was looking at this stuff next to me. I'm sure if you searched up ""hot naked men"" on any platform it would give you an idea of what he was looking at. Sometimes there were genitals in the pictures, sometimes there weren't. He has since explained to me that it was a naturist blog, how nudity isn't inherently sexual and that he wasn't aroused by what he was looking at. While I mostly believe that I still think it's pretty weird if you have to explain the difference between porn and naturism to justify stuff you were looking at around your underage daughter.

So, if it had been your 15 year old daughter who came to you and said ""my father looks at pictures of naked men whilst sat next to me and it makes me really uncomfortable"" how would you have responded? What actions would you have taken?

**TLDR-** my dad would look at pictures of naked men in front of me and I want to know how parents would respond to that behaviour.",5,5,1747330948.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kneett/what_would_you_do_if_you_found_out_the_father_of/
1kne3tk,Grandma's house left to my sister- how can I ask about living in it?,throwaway1896246,"I am 28F and my sister is 37F. Our grandmother passed a couple months ago and my sister was the executor of the will, the the house was left to her (there are no other assets). 

My sister was given land next to my grandma's house to build her home on, which they have been a little over 3 years. So now our grandma's house is sitting vacant next to her. She is planning to sell it because the house is paid off and is worth a lot (like 450k in current market). 

My current situation is that I'm in a relationship that has a history of sexual abuse and am trying to figure out a way to leave. I had spoken to her maybe a month ago about moving into the house temporarily to give my spouse time to decide if he wanted to keep or sell our home, but to give me a way to remove myself. She initially said yes on the phone but then when I came to visit her she said they actually decided to sell it, and that she could give me a little money once they make the sale. 

They are still in the probate period following my grandma's death so cant sell it currently, but that will be up in a couple weeks. 

I just kind of wanted to bring it up more time and discuss me living there and I could pay her rent and work on fixing the things that need repaired. And then when I eventually move (I would think like 3-5 years to allow me to start over) she could sell it- but hard to know what the value will be like then. Having me in the area would also mean i could help with her kids (I dont have any of my own). 

Another issue and part of why I worry she maybe wouldn't want me living there is because I have 3 dogs, they are well behaved but its still THREE, but they are non-negotiable.

I guess I feel guilty asking her to not act on an opportunity to make a lot of money that she plans to invest in her children's futures. But I dont have a lot of options and dont want to regret not trying.

I dont want to sound greedy or pushy, I'm just trying to figure out how to help myself when my finances are tight. 

TDLR; sister has the opportunity to sell a home no one is living in for a large sum of money, but I would like to ask about living in it to get myself out of a bad situation. ",2,10,1747330216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kne3tk/grandmas_house_left_to_my_sister_how_can_i_ask/
1knd5nx,Is it ok to leave our Father?,OpinionSeparate8525,"Hi all! I'm F(29) and my Big sis F(31) and brother M(27). I would like to apologize my English is not well versed, so please bare with me. Thank you 😊. We just recently lost our mother age 65 from cancer. She was diagnosed last year stage 4. It was all sudden. At first we were in denial because no family history in her side died or diagnosed of cancer. All died from old age. So it's been hard for us. For context here is my family story history. My Mother was a great housewife. She's very hands-on us growing up. From cleaning, washing and cooking (oh how I missed her cook foods 😭). She's strict but it made us who we are today. She's very religious too. every night she will prayed with the rosary and her usual prayer for us her children be successful in life. Also she prayed for the companies will be working to be not toxic and have good working environment and good officers and bosses. I have high respect and very much love her till this day. However my father I don't have much any ounce of respect and love for him. His previous job is a seafarer. According to mom, his a great provider when we where young. But suddenly he became irresponsible husband. Here is the list that he done to us. Just to summarize.

Manhandle my mom especially when he is losing the argument. Please take note that mom is 4""10 - 4""11ft and Father 5'10ft.

Not going home for 5 years. On and off contact. Going home from his older sister house, his cousin house or in his hometown. But not his home with us.

Multiple mistresses he kept. All his older sibling known the mistresses. Possible some illegitimate children 🤷🏻‍♀️. We don't know.

Borrowing money to his older sister for us but he lied. Which we just known recently during the funeral when one of our cousin tell us this. All of us are mad because during that time we have no food I think I was that aged of 13. The money she send to my father was spend in his smoking and drinking.

M0lesting his two daughters. Yes I was a victim at a very young age. It happened twice. My mother known this and they argued and humiliate my father. But we still stayed for the reason of he is the sole provider. And I understand why mother stayed. We still studying in a private school she doesn't want us to stop studying in a good school for our future. Because both of them didn't go to college. And education is a must to us. Typical Asian Mom. but she doesn't care about the grades we have as long as it's passing and we still graduate all good to her.

Always accusing my mother having a relationship to a family man. Which is false. Because like I said my mom is very hands-on to us, she always delivered our lunch in school. She always tells us she will go to church and if we want to come with her and we always do. If I came home from school, I always see her doing laundry, cleaning the house, cooking for dinner and sometimes asleep. We saw everything and our neighbors will tell that my mom doesn't have any relationship with other man only my father. Especially last year after mom surgery in myoma and colostomy bag. He accused her again having afair. Like my ghad my mom is a very introverted person. She always stays in the house due to her condition and have time to have an affair? My brother stays withe her 24/7 to take care of her. He stop working just to take care our mom. 

Always telling my mom and my other cousins have a p0rn video. Still false. Still grossed and no proof has been made. 

Committed suicide last year because we didn't take care of him. Same year as my mom hospitalized and gone to surgery. Me and my older sis are paying the rent, grocery and all bills. And his mad or 'depressed' because we didn't take care of him. No when he inflicted stab in his chest he was crying for help and my mother was one who saw what he have done. My mom was in distressed, me and my brother is the one staying at the hospital just to take care of him. When he was discharged he was like proud to tell our neighbors what he have done and tell them that his children is fighting with him. No we just ignore him due to lack respect to us and especially my mother.

Always demanding to give him money for his smoking and drinking. This time he is retired from being a seafarer (which has no savings and no property to own). Me and my older sis income is bare minimum with the bills and groceries are high it's just exact to us and my brother that time is still studying. If we didn't give him the money, he will act out of control which cause my mom distressed and pleaded us to give him money.

Currently his working as a daytime security guard in a warehouse. He didn't help in our expenses in the house especially the hospital bills. But sometimes he always ask us if we have some money. It so tiring to understand his situation.


My mom stayed in her relationship because she still hoping that my father will change till the end. She also wants to stop the cycle of broken family from her and my father side. She forgave him but didn't forget. So in the start of Feb this year my father didn't see her or talk to her. Even though we stayed in one small house. We always tell him that mom is sleeping. And we didn't let him visit her in the hospital as per her request and might cause her more unnecessary stress. She was cremated in mother's day which is so hard to us siblings.

Now me and my siblings are planning to move out from our house. My mom is no longer with us and the house is no longer a home without her, also we feel we are not safe anymore especially me and my older sister if we stayed. But due to expenses and loans we accumulated we might delay the move out. Even though we want to move out urgently.

So reddit is it wrong for us to left our father.
*Also, how do you cope up after losing your mother?

1knao2z,My mom left after a huge fight with my dad. I’m stuck in the middle and finals are in 5 days.,potuslancer,"Hi guys, I (M22) am going through something and I really need to get this off my chest.

Three days ago, my parents had a huge fight—lots of yelling. The next morning, while I was at college, my mom(55) called me crying, said she had another fight with my dad(65), he trashed the house, and that she was leaving. She said she couldn’t take it anymore.

I didn’t know what to do. After college, I went to my dad’s office . I didn’t tell him mom had left—I guess part of me was hoping she’d be back by the time we got home. But when we got to the house, no one opened the door. I called mom and she said she left *us*. Said ""goodbye.""

We had backup keys with my aunt (lives nearby) so we entered. The whole place was a disaster. Food from the fridge thrown everywhere, broken plates and glass all over the floor. It was honestly horrifying. My dad didn’t say anything. Just silence.

I cleaned the whole place by myself. It took three hours. I even cut my hand cleaning up broken dishes. There was nothing left to eat, so my dad ordered food online.

It’s been two days since she left. She only called once—I didn’t pick up. I was too angry. I don’t know if she left for good. They’ve been married for 25 years.

My older sister (married, lives elsewhere) called and yelled at me, blaming me for not doing anything or telling her sooner. But what was I supposed to do? I’m overwhelmed. Finals are in 5 days. I can't think straight.

I feel like I’m holding everything together with tape and string. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to study. I don’t know if I should call my mom back. I don’t even know how to *feel* about my dad right now.

1kn738f,Would I be out of line?,HeartShapedBox7,"My mom and dad  have always been very good to my mom’s siblings and their families.  Oftentimes,  sacrificing our own family’s needs for the benefits of theirs. That includes: paying their mortgages, paying for their cars, paying for their children’s education, and so much more.

Today, my parents are both terminally ill and there is no family support. It’s pretty obvious that their support left us as soon as we could no longer financially support them. However, they like to blame their lack of support on my mother’s behavior since she’s gotten sick. Admittedly, my mother has always had a difficult personality and it’s gotten a lot worse since she’s been sick. However, a lot of it has to do with her dealing with the loss of her independence. 

My dad is currently  in the hospital. My mom’s sister, who lives 4 houses down from us, has been texting me regularly asking me if I need anything. Would I be out of line if I responded the following (I also do not want to seem like I’m begging):

Aunty, what I need is for someone to check on my mom who spends all day in bed fatigued and in pain. She may be a lot of things but she’s not wicked minded. A wicked minded person is someone who forgets all the good her sister has done for her throughout the years and holds against her the behaviors she’s exhibited since she’s been sick knowing very well she has 1-2 years more to live.

1kn4wwg,Am i overracting? Or is it really considered suffocating?,sunnyshynn,"I am a 20 y/o dropped out student from some unknown local univ. The school that i was in got reported to CHED back then and i didn't really got good grades there even tho i always study the whole syllabus once it was laid out by our profs from first day of our meeting.

As a kid who was craving attention-- and seeks affirmation from my mother, after i heard my mother bragging about how i learned to read and write at the age of three. My little brain went floating on cloud 9. You can probably guess what happened next. Obviously, i tried my best to get her approval. Back then, 'English' was a powerful weapon to wield. So i learned English at the age of 4, by borrowing my cousin's Dictionary & Thesaurus (she was a college student).

Usually you attend pre-school before kindergarten here back then, and you can't attend kinder if you're only 4 yr old. But my step-dad was bold enough to make a bet on the school lol. He said i can understand most stuffs already so just try making me read, write and count. As the fool i am, i bragged the hell out of me. That's how all the sh8 started.

When i was a Senior High School student, my family was never really that much understanding of my situation. It was pandemic back then. My mother, was also a student back then. There's this thing called ALS here in ph, which allows those who wish to pursue their studies regardless of their age. My older sister was in college too back then, while the youngest is taking modular classes as a 3rd grade student--- til 4th grade. My parents would always ask me to assist the youngest with her activities, and since it was MODULAR where no one can actually teach her, i was the one who was teaching her the entire time.

The funny thing was when it was my turn to do the studying for my own classes and activities---- they want me to stop whatever i am doing telling me to stop using the pretext of studying to avoid doing chores.

I took it to heart so i just went ahead and finish all chores before doing mine. But at the time it was over, it's time to head to bed. THEM PEEPS BE turning all the lights off and saying ""~~You have all time to do that during the day, so just sleep~~."" But in the morning, there are morning chores. At Lunch i have to help making it. In the afternoon i have to tutor my li'l sis. In the evening i have to help with dinner.

I have a friend group back then who helped me all-throughout my senior year. However, of course they got fed up with me too. The fact that i have to cry my heart out whenever i do my activities was nothing less exhausting. I loose those friends due to unchanging cycle.

Back to my college years---it was rather disappointing. All the efforts i did at home and school are completely overlooked. At school i didn't get the grade i deserved, it was awful. Due to the school not paying the professors properly they were getting back to US--their students. At home i feel like i was some kind of maid that needs to heed to their every call, exhausting it is. But what they call me is something else ""A LAZY BUM"". My mom was a senior high school already when i get to college. She barely did chores due to her busy schedule at school. She sometimes have gigs during the night too.

I was the ONE--no the ONLY ONE. Who was doing chores at home back then. I know all of them are mostly exhausted, but how can they belittle the stuffs i did?

Last year i got fed up and insisted on dropping out--- my mum had a miscarriage too. I told them i was just gonna work and give up studying for now. I HATE IT. STUDYING I MEAN. IM ALREADY SO FED UP STUDYING. JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT IS MAKING ME THROW UP.

I was able to get a job-- earn and pay bills at home. Funnily enough it wasn't taken well. I overheard my mother talking with my aunt that there's no way i don't have money since i didn't really spend on anything?

I WAS THE ONE WHO BOUGHT MOST OF MY SIS' NECESSITIES FOR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONE PAYING OUR ELECTRICITY AND INTERNET BILLS. WHENEVER THEY ASKED ME FOR SOMETHING I GIVE IT TO THEM. YET I HAVE NOTHING TO SPEND ON? THE ONLY THING I BOUGHT FOR MYSELF WAS A FRIGGIN PERSONAL LAPTOP WHICH ALL OF US LITERALLY USE?

Now with the present, they want me to enroll again. I asked them if i can shift my course but it was for naught. My father said i won't earn sh8. My lil sis wants to be on some musical conservatory and study music for college too. But when she told our parents.. the typical asian answer it is. ""HUWAG KAYONG MAS MARUNONG PA SAMIN."" I get what they mean, but why is it our responsibility to make fortune for them? We never asked to be here.

Now im facing something terrible, i have always been the yes type of person with them. But it's too much. If i pursue what they want, my lil sis won't be safe from them comparing her to me. If i choose not to enroll, i am a freaky ungrateful kid.

Now my mother is saying ""If you don't enroll, i'll be taking your phone and laptop from you."" GIRL???????? THE PHONE? SURE. BUT MY PERSONAL LAPTOP? THAT I. PERSONALLY. BOUGHT. WITH. MY. BLOOD. SWEAT. AND. TEARS???

I can't even go out without their permission. Now their taking something i use to save some pocket money. Am i missing something? Or is it fine to feel this way? IDK anymore.

TDLR : I don't know what to do with them. I want to break free but i don't want to leave my lil sis behind in this exhausting family. My sis already left, so i can't just leave her behind. Is what i feel matter? Or should i try to endure some more. But if so, for how long?",1,4,1747305164.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kn4wwg/am_i_overracting_or_is_it_really_considered/
1kn4moj,"I think something really bad is happening in my family, but i don’t know what.",KeyApprehensive1173,"Background info:
I (F18) and my older brother (21) are currently living with our mother. My brother has not lived full time with my father and stepmom since he was about 8 years old. I however just moved back to my mom’s house in 2024 upon graduation. I was stoked to leave that house as the constant arguing, alcoholic mother, and manipulation was so harmful to my mental health. I lived there with my step sister (15) and half brother (13). my sister is my stepmoms child with another father and my brother is my dads kid as well as my stepmoms. My dad got a job offer out of state and is definitely moving but he keeps telling my little sister (in secret) that her and my younger brother can visit him whenever they like but that they probably aren’t moving with him. My stepmom is under the impression that the whole family is moving, but i believe she has suspicions. 






I have noticed a few concerning behaviors in the last couple of weeks and was wondering what i can do or if i should call someone. I’m worried about my siblings. 

-after being fired from her 8 yr job for something she didn’t do (a month after having an affair with her boss) my stepmom has not been able to hold a job and even when she still held her position, she told my sister and i that she was gonna try to get fired.

- my stepmom has been stealing money from my sister that her dad sends her and this past week she has stolen some from me too. whenever asked about it, she claims “the money was wiped from the account” but she is a karen level type of person who has in the past ALWAYS called about suspicious activity. she also made the money going missing seem like my fault and brought it up in casual conversation over a week after it happened. 

- she texted me the day of claiming she would send me money and she never did, but i didn’t care because i thought it was an offer not something she owed me. 

- days after this, she started sending me texts about making a documentary about how amazing having a blended family is and how she thought “we had something”. her texts made no sense at all. i’ll give some direct quotes.

- “I was thinking about making a virtual video book about you 4 kids. Don't think it's weird. I think we have something.  Just think about it. “

-“Ok , I think we can pull it together with the Book cover title that will truly give us a path. What do you think? “

- not only were her texts not making sense, but whenever she has an idea (she’s never had any this extreme) she typically expresses it on call. she has not brought this up to me at all since and none of my siblings have been clued in. 

- another thing that has weighed on my mind is the dynamic between her and my brothers. she uses manipulation against everyone in our family but i notice my younger brother is more receptive towards it. insults that typically wouldn’t hurt him almost bring him to tears from her (i know that things hit different from your mother).

- an example is responding to questions of sleepovers with “Don’t you love mommy?” and pesters him until tears. 

Side note: these only are relevant in relation to the next bit of information I about to provide. tw: cocsa 
-my eldest brother has no clear memories of his childhood or anything before 18 or 19. my younger brother, when he was about 9 was involved in a situation that ended in child on child sexual assault (cocsa) where he was the perpetrator. when i found out i was just in highschool and thought nothing of it but as a result of learning more about what cocsa is, i began to give it more thought. my parents denied the other parents when they were told of what had happened. 

tldr;
tw: cocsa
my dad is moving out of state in june. after being fired from her 8 year job, she has not been able to hold a job. She has been stealing money from my sister and i and explains it with excuses. she did not tell me the about the money until about a week after it was stolen. she was sending me odd messages about making a documentary about our family, but never brought it up again or mentioned it to my siblings. She is extra manipulative and attached to my brothers. The older one uses memory repression as a coping mechanism and the younger one was involved in cocsa where he was the perpetrator. my parents denied this and refused to confront the issue. (please read the whole post before commenting this doesn’t do it justice.)




i know this seems like kind of a trauma dump and it’s really unorganized, but i really can’t sit with all of this and not do anything. i’ve been having really disturbing dreams about everything my siblings are going through where i wake up crying, which has never happened before.

I have a cousin, she’s someone I saw like a sister especially because I’m an only child and anyway over the years a few times she suggested meeting on trips but whenever I ask her to follow up on details like where when etc she ignores me and instead deflects to something else weeks later as though that conversation never happened 

This has happened multiple times over the years, not just once and I’m at a point of frustration and I don’t get why she bothers with empty words that raise my hopes. What she does is usually ignore me and then mass send me photos of her kids weeks later and expect me to validate or something I don’t even get it 

Well last weekend I was abroad and I hadn’t bothered to tell her bcos I decided to stop keeping in touch, I just posted the photos 7 days ago on my social media and that very day she text me asking how I am bcos I think she saw the photos. I replied that I was abroad etc and asked how she is…. No reply. 7 days later no reply still. And instead randomly she send me this slide via instagram. Is it a dig at me ? I just don’t get it. I want to build real connection and have meaningful conversation or at least a conversation but she ignores and sends this. She always does this, usually when I text her she ignores and then weeks later will send something unrelated as if the previous convo never happened   

I’m trying to figure out what’s her purpose sending these and is it a dig ? Each slide is with different quotes, ive put the quotes in the slide below

2. “You don’t have to get it. I didn’t come here to be decoded. I came here to be free”

8. I’m not here to fit your story. I write my own now 
9. I’m not for everyone and that’s the beauty of belonging to myself 
10. I stopped editing myself when I realised truth was the entire point

1kn25aa,How do I go about planning events around family who SAd me,LuluLovesLemons1380,"MASSIVE TRIGGER WARNING FOR CSA all stated ages are current

TLDR: I was sexually assaulted by one cousin with whom I am NC, but his disabled sister (who aided in the abuse) is still apart of my life very distantly. I do not want to invite her to future events in my life, but am unsure if it’s the right path. 


Hello, this isn’t technically relevant to my life right now, but I (21F) have been thinking about this a LOT recently and was hoping to get some advice/insight into this issue I am bound to have as my life goes on.

For some background, when I was a child (from ages roughly 6-12) I was habitually molested by my (26M) cousin ‘John’. At the time he was also a child, although he was older than I was. The abuse for me began after his sister (and my best friend at the time) ‘Gracie’ (24F) brought me to him and instructed me on what to do. For everyone’s sake I won’t get more graphic than that, but know that in every way imaginable Gracie was also a victim of John’s and I have always understood that on some level.

The abuse only stopped because I reached an age where the beginnings of ‘the talk’ began and I realized exactly how bad the things my cousins made me do were. While it had always made me uncomfortable, and often hurt, I had not realized it wasn’t normal behavior as my older cousins both told me it was. The last time it ever happened was at a holiday party where John attacked me, just a locked door and room away from the rest of our family. For the first time all of the trauma came back up and I managed to get the door open and ran to my mom and told her what happened.

To keep this brief, and not reveal every grueling aspect of an already deeply socially awkward child coming to grips with the after affects of that type of trauma, I will summarize the next few years. Although there was some investigation into the matter, it took place a few years after the last occurrence and I was fairly unwilling to cooperate at the time due to feeling like I was tearing our family apart. (I would come to find out much later that my family had believed that the last incident was the only one, and figured I was being dramatic)

For years I refused to visit that side of the family, out of constant fear of not knowing if John would be present. My absence was both very unusual for our family and very clearly hurting my mom. It took me until I was about 16 to be willing to visit with them again, and it was borne out of a desire to make my mom happy and to not let John continue to control and hurt me now that I was old enough to know better and fight back. However, the anxiety of not knowing if I would have to see him made every visit a crescendo of panic and regression until the point it was either confirmed he was not present, or if he was I would then devolve into all out survival mode and hide as best I could. As I got older, however, he began showing up to these events less and less. Within the past few years he hasn’t come to single event- not a single wedding, reunion, vacation, holiday, nothing. If it’s due to not being invited or not coming I do not know.

My relationship with Gracie, too, was utterly destroyed. She was both John’s victim and the person who offered me up to him on a silver platter. She couldn’t have known better, she didn’t know better, but it doesn’t change the fact that every time I look at her all I can see are the flashes of each and every time she was there and either watched or helped her brother. None of this is helped by the fact that Gracie was in a car accident when she was young that left her with permanent brain damage and developmental issues. Making it even harder for me to deal with these resentments. When I was a young teen, I lashed out at her exactly one time. I still regret my words to this day. After that, and as I got older, I just began to flat out ignore her. These days I try my best to engage if she addresses me, but I find it extremely hard to look at her directly and my skin crawls every time she hugs me.

Not many people truly know what happened with Gracie, John, and me. I only told my mother everything that happened this past year, and it wasn’t an intentional confession. I’m positive Gracie never told her parents, or if she did then they choose to ignore it and support John to this day. I cannot emphasize enough how complicated my relationship is with my mom’s side of the family. They are, in general, a very close knit group that I am on the outside of due primarily to my own actions, but I do love them dearly. I do want to be closer to my family, I want to be able to engage with them the way my siblings and other cousins can- but I will admit many years of self isolation has given me a large disadvantage there.

When it comes down to it, John, Gracie, and their family is just one part of a much larger, involved family that values time spent together very highly. The family is big enough that most of the time partners are only introduced if one is VERY sure they’re here to stay, simply because introductions and questions and bonding takes way too long with that many people (and those things very much are an expectation on some level). When someone in the family has an event, the expectation is if you invite some family you must at the very least extend the invite to them all (this is with the exception of child free weddings, because we have so many kids in the family inviting them all to weddings can easily add 10-15 people to the guest list, which fluctuates as more of my cousins begin to have children). And that is exactly what troubles me.

I’m getting to the point where I am thinking about things like getting myself started career wise and eventually getting married. But when I think about my wedding, the guest list already is posing a huge issue and I am literally still single. How am I supposed to go about inviting my family and having them join me for a big life event, when I can’t stomach the thought of inviting the one cousin everyone protects with their life? Gracie has obviously been through a lot aside from what her brother did to us both, and those struggles are the only ones the rest of my family is aware of. If I don’t invite her, that would certainly cause problems with not only her family- but basically all of my aunts, uncles and cousins. Revealing the reason why to them feels both so invasive and cruel to Gracie as well. How can I bring up the shit she did when we were kids when she will literally never live a normal life thanks to an alcoholic who took lives into their own hands? I know, to them, if I don’t invite her and don’t explain why, I would  be a huge insane monster who is bullying the visibly disabled cousin she barely knows anymore.  But if I do invite her I know my entire wedding all I will think about is how badly I do not want her to be there. I don’t want her in my wedding photos, I don’t want reminders of how I can’t forgive and forget plastered on my wall. But I also don’t want to damage what is already a very tenuous relarionship with my family.

All of this is, of course, many years away from being relevant to my life. But I have been thinking about it a lot recently. What do I do? If you have any other questions I can clarify them. I know this is a long post, lots of things were lightly discussed but it’s also about two decades worth of twisting and complicated history that may be more relevant than I am giving it credit for given my perspective.",3,2,1747293537.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kn25aa/how_do_i_go_about_planning_events_around_family/

1kmxxxo,Done being a piggy bank and now feeling guilty,GloomyPlatypus4119,"Hi everyone. So back story - I have two younger siblings (25-F, 17-M) and I am a 30 year old female. My dad left us to go back home when I was 18, so 12 years ago. After a year after he left, I started helping my mom out financially. Since 2019, I’ve given her over $135k - that’s about $20,000/year. I also worked and went to school full time to pay for my undergrad. 

Anywho, this burden of being the eldest of an immigrant family has been eating me alive for years. I’ve never been able to have a savings, and now I finally do since I stopped giving money for the past year now but enough was enough. I had a few meltdowns over the years over this financial support I had to give but still always continued to give up until last year. 

So for the past year, my younger sister has been paying the bills for my mom etc. Unfortunately my mom is in a lot of credit card debt after my dad left. I still usually pay for the food when we go out and take them on little trips and stuff. 

I feel anger, disappointment, annoyance and also guilt because of all this. All this responsibility and my inner child not being fully healed has caused me to become a miserable person I am afraid. 

Tonight we argued over money because I had paid for my sister’s car repairs and she never said thanks so I brought it up to remind her I paid, and they said I’m sick and they can’t believe I’m obsessing over money with family. My mom even denied I gave over $135k even though I have the bank statements to prove it. 

I want to cut all ties with them at this point (except for my brother). Am I a bad person for wanting this?

I haven’t spoken to my dad in years and it turns out he actually has a baby and a toddler with some lady back home now. 

I also want to add, during fights and arguments in general - I have this nasty tendency to make matters worse on purpose; like I purposefully say mean things to hurt them even though I feel guilty immediately after. Any mental health experts know why this is? ",8,8,1747278045.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmxxxo/done_being_a_piggy_bank_and_now_feeling_guilty/
1kmxx8v,Lost,MeringueEarly8518,"I’m a 23 year old male. 

This is a long post, but please bear with me. 

I’m starting to feel absolutely lost in life, and i am looking for ways to reconcile my family. 

Some context:
My mother and father are still married and i have a 19 y/o sister. My mother has become increasingly insufferable. She is miserable with everything, if there is something that she can complain about, she will. It doesn’t matter if it is something as little as breathing, or the tv volume, or how someone walks in the house, she will act as if it’s the end of the world. She is also extremely controlling. She forces me as well as my sister to be reliant on her so she has leverage and any time she becomes upset, she hangs whatever she can over my head. Car insurance is a big one, but, she will not let me purchase my own car insurance and let me legally re register my vehicle in my name. She withholds my legal documents from me, attempts to monitor my spending, and more. Keep in mind, i have never done anything to prove i am untrustworthy nor am i finally irresponsible. My father and my mother can barely spend 5 seconds in a room together without fighting. Her negative attitude is a serious issue and she truly attempts to pick fights with people and holds things over our heads consistently. 

Ultimately, this has made for a family dynamic that is utter misery. She has caused major issues in my relationship because she gets upset and guilts me whenever i miss a family dinner or I do something without her. She is constantly making us feel guilty for lack of doing things, and is forcing us to do things for her. She complains and calls us all names in front of us if she doesn’t get her way. She lets little things bother her significantly that shouldn’t. 

She also becomes livid when anyone spends any time relaxing on a weekend. If we are not working around the house, in the backyard, or doing something that needs to be done, she throws a fit that often leads to a screaming match. She will call us lazy while she spends more time on the couch than any of us. 

She has been extremely unsupportive of my business ventures, my desire to further my education, and any of my hobbies. She does not listen to what i have to say about anything i’m passionate about and has selective hearing many times. 

She often makes demands on things that we need to do, and expects it to be done instantly, even if we are wrapped up with something effectively more important (like my job, given i WFH)

To put it into perspective, she does not have a bad life. Financially, my family is in a good spot. We live in a house in an upper middle class neighborhood that is worth approximately $1m, plus, my father is the breadwinner and earns over six figures with his own business. My mother works a few hours a day for the benefits, her job is about 15 minutes away and has off during the summer. It is not labor intensive nor require any specific skill. She spends a fair amount of time at home during the middle of the day watching TV on the couch. My sister and I have always been “good kids” we have never had any issues, always been fairly good students and i personally have succeeded well in my eyes. I graduated college 2 years early with a 3.97, and hold a full time job now in my respective career. 

Given my mother’s actions, my father has become depressed. He works at a minimum 10 hours a day, but in my mom’s eyes it is never enough. She makes it all a competition. I think she feels like she is cheated because she handles chores around the house… but in my fathers defense he is away 12 hours a day so i’m not sure when he would have the time to handle cooking a meal, or cleaning the house. Even if my father did that, my mother would find something wrong with it. She has severe OCD and is never pleased with how the house is clean. We had a maid for a fair amount of time, and she would consistently argue the house was not clean (when in reality it was spotless, you could have eaten off the toilet). We can’t do any cleaning to her satisfaction, nobody can.

It is almost as if she does things, so she can complain about it. She does not like cooking, she does not like cleaning. We go out to eat, we go hire someone to clean the house. She then will complain about the food at the restaurant or the way the house was cleaned. 

My father has reached a point where now all he does is complain about his life. And i can’t blame him. It is miserable for him from the moment he opens his eyes to the moment he closes them. 

Then, there comes my sister. She is mostly out of my life. We never really got along. She is entitled and moody. She will do anything in her power to one up me and get a better hand over me. I.e. the other night, i got in the shower and she immediately started banging on the door screaming saying she needed to take a shower too. She then told my mom (keep in mind. i am 23 years old.)

My mother has expressed that they are going to pay/fund my sisters college tuition and rent which is 3x more than mine, while i am on the hook for mine. She is consistently looking for vehicles for her and gave her a brand new car when she got her license when i was on the hook for mine. So, things are not anywhere near equal. I’m not saying they have to be, but, i went a few months in college wishing i had more help living on ramen noodles while my sister is having steak dinners with her friends. This does not sit right with me. 

My sister recently stated that she wants to go back to college subsequently to her bachelors. My mom is in full support of it. I on the other hand have been working for a few years piling up as much money as i could so i could go back to school to continue my education because my mother expressed that i would not get any help from them whatsoever. (the program i want to do is on site and full time so i wouldn’t be able to hold a full time job and do school at the same time since i currently work 80 hours a week between my actual work and travel) 

So, evidently there is some bias. Which is fine. However, my sister gets whatever she wants. She is never criticized. She gets slapped on the wrist from my mom. She attempts to boss me around despite me being the most educated and almost the highest earning person in the house and often times my mom enforces it. 

You might be saying to yourself, why do you listen? The truth is, if i don’t, something dear to my heart will be either held over my head or thrown away. It doesn’t matter how much value it has either sentimentally or monetarily. my mom will use any leverage she has to get her way and if you defy her she will make your life a living hell. Financially, my parents don’t support me much. I pay my rent at my apartment, i pay for my vehicles, i pay for my clothes, and all my bills. They cover my car insurance (because all my cars are registered in their name) and my phone bill. It is maybe $300/month. My father does not care, but my mom holds it over my head. i have no problem paying for these things, but she will not let me as i said earlier. 

I often end up going to my childhood home and staying there instead of my apartment because things are held over my head. My mom will either say she is going to throw away something of mine that is thousands of dollars that i worked hard for or will make me feel horrible if don’t come home. 

Ultimately, my mom will say anything to get what she wants. she does not care what she says to someone or repercussions it has. However, if someone treats her with 10% of how she treats me, it’s the end of the world and she lets it bother her forever and will hold a grudge. She is truly a miserable person. i use the analogy that she looks at a glass that is 3/4 full and gets pissed because after a few sips it will be 1/2 empty. 

So, that brings you up to speed with my family problems. Then, there is my relationship. 

My girlfriend and i have been together for some time, my mom becomes an issue often. She gets upset when we do something alone. But she weirdly plays both sides. I am not perfect and i understand that, but, you would think when i am venting about something that happened in my relationship she wouldn’t go back and say something to my girlfriend, but she does. She told my girlfriend about what i said to my father (that she overheard) that was bothering me. And she also told her that she is an “idiot and let’s me walk all over her” because my girlfriend lets me use her car since i got into a car accident and my mother made it clear that if i bought a second car, she would have thrown away about $10,000 worth of my personal items. So, the only reason i have her car is because of my mom. 

This has made for a horrible dynamic in my relationship. I am put in positions where my mom does not want to spend time with my gf and my gf does. it want to spend with my mom. They almost make me choose one over the other then one ends up hurt. this has destroyed the hobbies that i have and the things that i enjoy. 

In addition my girlfriend gives me zero space, and if i ask she makes me feel awful about it. I get time to myself when i am in the bathroom or traveling for work but aside from that i am stuck with her or my family. I have no free time any more, and cant see my friends because if it isn’t my mom it’s her. She consistently makes me feel like what i do is not enough. I’m sure part of this is on me though for not having a strong foot and being firm with things. My relationship has become one sided recently and it is something that i should have better control of. 

Then, there is my job. I work a lot and am statistically underpaid. I log about 80 hours a week and am not compensated well. That is on me. I was okay getting experience to land a good PhD program or MS program or even a lateral job movement. However, recently, my firm fired everyone but one other person at my level (previously 8, now 2) so, myself and one other person have to juggle what was once made for 8 people and there is no slack cut on my end. I am expected to do more and handle more. They have been nitpicking things like my administrative time entries (which has increased to coordinate tasks), other time entries here and there (spent 40 minutes telling me what i did was wrong despite my time being worth 12 minutes) and gave me a poor review that was entirely contradictory during the in person interview (my manager would say one thing, then would subsequently contradict it)

This has made me increasingly uncomfortable at work. I’ve been at my firm for almost 3 years now, but all of a sudden these little things are issues and everything i’m doing is nitpicked from specific manager level people where as others leave me be and let me work as normal and give nothing but good feedback, however none of that is reflected in my formal review. 

This has made me even worse mentally. I am at a point where i don’t know what i should do next. The honest solution is to get a new job but between my family, my relationship and my current work commitment i don’t even know when i could make the time.

Now i see my friends building some sort of resentment because i often can’t spend time with them and/or im not there when they might need my help. 

My father has tried to make my mom agree to family counseling, but she won’t. I can’t have them get a divorce even though they probably should. I should probably get a better grip on my relationship. And  as for my job, i likely just need to find the time to get a new one. 

In summary, how do you fix a person that is just purely miserable? How do you solve internal family issues with that person? Even if that person doesn’t have valid reasons to be miserable? What would you do in my situation? I feel as if i’m an optimistic person, and a good problem solver, but, for the life of me i cannot reconcile my family nor make anyone happy anymore no matter what i do.

1kmuzzf,My father replaced me with his new wife and her kids,duckhunter5556,"Hey everyone, I (26m) I’ve been replaced by my stepmother and her kids. My parents were never married and were together until I was 10 years old when they broke up my father immediately started dating, he ended up getting married when I was 18. The woman he married is foreign and has two daughters both older than me. Between going off the college spending half the time with my mother and then after college living in a different state, they have effectively cut me out of the house. I was living 12 hours away until last year, my mother unfortunately was diagnosed with stage for cancer, and I rushed home to take care of her. She unfortunately passed three months later, through the whole process my father was distant and never really offered to assist me at all.
Since meeting my stepmother when I was 18, we have never really clicked. She’s foreign, but it’s very blunt and very superficial. But I always kept things very civil and never rock a boat. Her daughter‘s are polar opposites of each other one is very successful and just graduate med school and the other is a total leach of society. Since me and my soon-to-be wife moved to 12 hours away after college, my room has been completely dismantled, my father barely text me and I feel like a stranger in my own childhood home. My stepmother has also made comments about my deceased mother. Most not that bad but she made one to my fiancé at her bridal shower that was inexcusable.
With all that being said, everything was going fine until about a week ago when I finally after years of letting it go, stood up to my stepmother. She has always been nasty, judgmental, and very pushy with my fiancé. It came to head when my Stepmother was harassing my fiancé about wedding invites, and everything like that. My fiancé finally said please let us deal with it, and we will take care of it. My stepmother flew off the handle and was incredibly disrespectful. So with that encounter and what was said at the bridal shower, I decided to have a conversation with my stepmother. She denied everything and said my fiancé made it up. Which I know is not true, and basically stormed off.
Since that day, she is acted like a five-year-old and avoided me/spoken one word to me, unconnected with us on her only social media platform and told my extended family that she has nothing to do with the wedding. I had to say what I said because without it, there wouldn’t be a boundary. My father and I’s relationship has been fine since they’ve been married, but I always felt like it was a little foreign. I don’t care about an inheritance or anything like that. I just only care about my relationship with my father being he is my only close family member left.
I’m sorry if that was a little confusing. but to further explain how I feel like I am not a part of my father’s family, here are some examples:
-my father takes him out too expensive dinners, and on vacations and has never offered to take me out or take me on a vacation or just invited me for me to even pay my own way. For their birthdays they go to expensive dinners and I get pizza at the house
-He bought my stepsister a car off of a family member and I had my truck blow up and there was no word of even offering to help.
-he let my stepmother and stepsister take all the stuff out of my room and put in the basement and gave my room to my stepsister without asking me.
-I am getting married in about a month and instead of helping or offering to help for the wedding, he is taking them on an expensive trip.
I just want to have a healthy and good relationship with my father because he’s the last close family member I have left. I believe my stepmother knew she was in financial trouble and had no ability to retire when she married my father. Upon marrying my father, she retired sold her condo and moved right in. In a non-selfish way I don’t care about the Will or anything like that. It just hurts me that her and her stepdaughter are getting half of everything(if I don’t get cut out). I’m sorry that I rambled, if any of you have any advice or have dealt with any of this, please leave a comment.",7,3,1747268922.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmuzzf/my_father_replaced_me_with_his_new_wife_and_her/

1kmsgh9,Family is wildly uninterested in my hobbies. How do I cope?,SakuraFalls12,"I feel like such a baby even bringing this up, but this feeling pesters me more than I want to admit. My family doesn't care too much about my hobbies, but one of them I'm particularly proud of and excited about: writing fanfiction. I write nearly every day and I've done so for 5 years. It's a creative outlet for my emotions and just a big part of my life. My mom thought it was cute when I was writing stories as a child, but as my passion for writing developed, she seemed to have lost interest, along with the rest of my family.

I've asked her (yes, I asked, I know I'm pathetic) three times in the past five years if I can share something with her, and she's always said yes. But she never actually read anything. ""I want to really sit for this. I can't find the time."" IN FIVE YEARS?! Mind you, we're talking 6k words, which takes between 15-30 minutes to read.

Everyone in my family knows about my passion, but no one ever asks to read anything or even shows even the slightest bit of interest. Everyone always steers the conversation elsewhere or completely ignores my comment if I even **mention** that I'm writing. It's just incredibly disheartening. I know I shouldn't feel this way, especially since there are so many people around the globe who **are** interested in my silly stories! I share these fanfics online and I've gotten tens of thousands of hits, but it saddens me to know that not one of my family members are among those numbers. It pains me, especially since I try to make an effort to be excited for them when they're talking about something **they're** passionate about.

Is there any way for me to accept that they're just never gonna be interested in my hobby?

TLDR: My family doesn't care about my passion for writing and it makes me kinda sad. How can I accept that this is just the way things are?",3,6,1747261657.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmsgh9/family_is_wildly_uninterested_in_my_hobbies_how/

1kmpylq,I feel apathetic towards my younger sister and I don't know what to do.,Good-Independent2108,"
I'm sorry in advance if this is kinda all over the place but I just need to get this out and some different perspectives since I'm tiered of hearing the ""family is forever"" argument whenever I talk aboht this. 

I (18F) have two younger siblings. A little sister (15F) and brother (13M). This will be about my sister cuz my brother is a whole different thing.

Me and my sister always had a strained relationship. We're two different people. Even as kids we had problems, like the fact that I preferred to play alone and be alone but she wanted to play with me. I always shut her down. 

Thinks have come to a head in recent years (since 2020). Our parents have divorced. Both of us struggle with individual mental health problems. Which we also deal with differently. 
This is probably due to our mom. 
I learnt from a young age that the best way to stay on mom's good side is to be like her. Act like her. Think like her. My siblings complain alot that I act like our mom does. 

My sister, again, is the opposite. She is loud and bold. In a way I admire that, on the other hand it pisses me off because it makes our mom just much more angrier. 

My sister and I think differently, express ourselves differently. What I learned from our mom is that being quiet is the best way to avoid problems. That lead me too bottling my emotions up and I struggle alot with expressing how I feel. Plus, never will I talk about my feelings to my family. As the oldest I have to show resilience, to me the worst thing is when I happen to cry infront of them. I hate the feeling of weakness. 
My sister on the other hand wants to talk about her problems. She has come to me multiple times. But I can't do it. I can't deal with her emotions. It's too close. I've listened but I can't do anything with it. I honestly don't want her to talk to me about it, even if that sounds harsh. 

In a way she hates me for not being the good big sister she expected me to be. Yk, like from movies. The big sister that teaches makeup, how to dress up, gossips about boys, goes out or whatever. I am not like that and will never be. She calls me selfish. Does that sting? Yes. But it's temporary. 

I love my sister in the sibling type of way. But I know that if we weren't related I wouldn't be friends with her. Ofc we share good memories together. But when it comes to fights I just feel nothing. 
Someday I will probably move to another country. But if I had to stay it wouldn't be for her. I won't ever tell her that because I know it's heartless, but it's my truth. ",1,1,1747255345.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmpylq/i_feel_apathetic_towards_my_younger_sister_and_i/

It’s really strange. It’s like she presents herself as a lovely person but she’s been making these comments that I can’t get past. Basically I feel like she’s jealous of me. One time I sat with her and she said something strange and I don’t know if she was giving wisdom but she said “you never know right now you’re living it all good but then you never know you could just lose everything” and it felt like she was saying it directly to me. Then another time my aunty complimented me and said I look like my great grandma. Her words were “she’s very pretty” and then my cousin wife said “quite pretty” idk what it is but she sounds bitter. Im not sure why though when she has everything. And I’ve always been v nice to her. So I took a step back after I realised that she’s actually jealous of me. 

Im just ignoring her tbh and giving my greetings. But it just stuns me that my cousins who I really look up to, his wife is making me feel like this.

he’s never told me he’s proud of me, he doesn’t show affection at all (i think the last time he hugged me was my birthday and that was back in December), i don’t even remember the last time he’s told me he loved me. my mom says it’s implied that he loves me because he’s my dad but idk. i feel like he somewhat tries with my sisters but never with me.",1,2,1747252649.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmoukq/im_starting_to_think_my_dad_doesnt_like_me_and/

I recently got laid off and am looking for a new job, Im new to my career, my older sister Gina (31F) has a job that barely brings in 50K a year, my dad used to work odd jobs but now he has health issues and his job options are very limited, and even with that, he probably has a few more years of being able to work in him. My younger sister Georgia 24F grew up extremely spoiled. She was born delayed which caused some issues with learning such as learning new things at a slower pace than others her age. But otherwise she is still capable, its not like she is dumb, she is actually smarter than the average person I have met. But her problem is that she is extremely socially inept and emotionally immature.  However when she was a Kid, my dad took pity on her and basically condemned that she would never amount to anything so he would always lavish her with whatever she wanted, he never called her out on mistakes or even tried to teach manners because he didnt want to stress her and that ""She would learn these things in school anyways."" Well fast forward to many years later at this pace, she drops out of high school because of bullying, and now since then she has been sitting at home doing nothing but going on her ipad for the last 9 years. She has no friends, no ambition, no job nothing. 

Well my family is financially struggling and I believe she needs to get her stuff together and start working. But because of how much she was coddled, she has no ambition to do anything and any level of pressure makes her extremely stressed and anxious. Just getting her to do the dishes stresses her. I told her she needs to get a job eventually to help with the bills and she says to me ""I don't want responsabilities, I just want to be young and free"" Leaving me and my older sister to take care of her and pull her weight so she can be ""young and free."" I am frustrated, we have tried to support her to take steps but you can bring a horse to the water, but you cannot make it drink. I don't know what to do. Please help.

1kmnua9,Money dynamics; family assistance as you work towards self-sufficiency,Artistic_Trust_666,"Brief background, my parents are lower middle class. Maybe at one point they weren’t considered that but my dad’s income didn’t keep up with rising cost of living. However, my grandpa on my mom’s side has a lot of money. Tens of millions at least and growing through solid investments. My parents net worth is probably around $3-4M which includes our house at market value of $1.5M, and nearly $1M in retirement accounts they can’t yet touch. 

When I was growing up, I wasn’t allowed to get a job as “school is your job” but I wanted to go to senior prom with my friends and by the time I realized I would have to foot the bill, I didn’t have enough time to make the money by working a minimum wage job. So I had sex for money at 17. This started the pattern.

I worked a summer job before going to college but I had to quit 2 weeks early since my parents booked a vacation. I quickly used up that money on food, toiletries, random life expenses, and trying to have a social life. My parents wouldn’t help out. I ended up getting credit cards which started a cycle of me getting deep into credit card many times, still now.

Whenever I would ask for help, they would make me feel like if they gave me some money now, it would be my fault if some random freak event happened preventing them from working and needing to burn through their money. They put their hypothetical future stability above my present needs. 

Now I’m deep in debt with a dead end job at 28 living with my parents with no end in sight. I needed to quit my job of 4 years after I found out what we do is potentially criminal and being investigated. I am applying to go to law school and this would mess me up. I asked my parents for a loan so I could quit immediately and not worry about not being able to pay my bills. I’ve never really asked for a lump sum of money before (a few thousand would’ve been enough for me to quit) but my parents attitude is both the thing about their future financial security and that bailing me out won’t “teach me a lesson”. I’ve learned a million lessons in my life and I can’t escape this cycle, and I’ve been working for years trying, so it’s not like I’m lazy or lack ambition. I’m just stuck and won’t be able to pay for law school if I don’t get out of the debt death spiral. 

My question is: is it normal for parents (who can afford it) to help out their children until they  are fully established. I’m just thinking what I would do if I was a parent. Or do most parents sit on top of piles of money that would pay for their life for the next 25 years and watch their kids suffer and just wash their hands of it, feeling no sense of responsibility or remorse? I feel like everyone I know, from high school to college, all have their own place or with roommates, are getting married and having nice engagement photos/outfits/events, but are definitely not earning enough money to pay for all of the necessities plus have such a cushy lifestyle. Leading me to believe at least in my circles, when parents CAN help out, they do. It makes me feel like my parents are unwilling to prop me up until I have enough runway on my own because they don’t believe I’ll ever succeed. 

TLDR: stuck in a never ending debt loop (a pattern that started when I was a kid due to parental distortions on their own financial situation) that I’ll never be able to make enough money to get out of without outside help. Am I crazy for thinking my parents should help if they can? Especially knowing I had sex for money as a teenager because they refused to let me get an actual job but wouldn’t help me pay for just one thing that everyone else gets to participate in at the end of high school, despite being able to afford it but framing it that they can’t.

1kmjtue,"Problems with older controling, possible narc sister",Exotic-Astronaut-268,"Okey, this will be little long; just so you all get the sense of a person she always was and the person she still is, so how do you deal with someone who wants to control you, use you, abuse you, who wants, you, to prioritize them in everything. (we are both adults, she will be 23 and I will be 22 soon).

How to deal with someone who wants to be the best sister and the best sibling and child in everything, the one they often talk about and whom they often talk well about, she wants to be the main subject and the it girl to everyone, even other people outside of family, in her every workplace she had to be the hero and the golden person whom they all adore and whom almost all are afraid of so she has the control and power, she aint afraid to brag about wanting everyone to fear her, it doesnt just stop at her workplace, but everyone must be afraid of her for her to feel better about herself, for her to feel in control and for her to feel like some sort of queen, fear some people have for her is only feeding her ego and making her even more disgusting person..

She often brags about being the best out us sisters and the most desired, I am the youngest girl in our family, not just from siblings but from whole family, she is the second youngest after me in the whole family.

She is the golden child, my mother has way too much narc traits but she (mother) isnt and probably wont be diagnosed by health professional about her being a narc, she doesnt like going to them bc she cant and she wont make an effort to even see her mistakes and her wrong doings, the thing professionals ask her to think about, she doesnt like them holding her accountable, she always must be the victim, she hasnt apologized even once for any of her mistakes, not even little ones, she is a person nobody normal wants to be around, other than those similar to her, I for most part ignore my mother bc there aint no healthy way to deal with that woman other than ignoring.

My mother uses and abuses (if she can) other people to get what she wants, she often spins the stories to match her narrative of her always being a victim and often than not people dont like her acting like victim and they dont like that weak mindset so they mostly avoid her like the plague.

I still have to live here bc its too expensive in my country, I live with them both.

I might be able to move out in next 2 to 3 years and I most likely plan to move further away from our town so I cant be around them at all, but until then I have to protect my sanity.

My sister when we were teens, like 15/16 years old, when we were alone, did confess to me that she is jealous of me being smarter than her and for having better grades than her, thats the first and the last compliment of hers that I got. (I think she said that then bc she wanted me to validate her and make her feel better about herself bc she was down at time about the guy and she wanted to say that so I could give her even more attention, validation and compliments, she was fishing for compliments, maybe even for me to say oh no that aint true, you are smarter and other bullshit, just so she can feel better, bc she does feel better and more powerful if someone has it bad in life, she feeds of someone being weaker, worse and in worse position than her, she feels happy about it too).

She feels powerful and good about putting someone down, she adores gossiping and being the center of attention, when we were teens she loved to put me down about me still being a virgin (while she wasnt), she loved to use the point of me not being that much social as to explain why I am still a virgin, she loved to rub that shit in my face bc she felt like winner that I am a virgin (loser in her eyes) with almost no friends, while she is the desired sister who everybody wants to either f or hang out with or be, whom older guys invite to their parties and their hanging outs, I wouldnt keep silent if she attacked me about that, I didnt have any problem with me being a virgin, nor with me having few friends nor me not going to parties with older guys, and I never spoke about it in any way, I never mentioned it, not even to talk about it let alone complain about it, it just wasnt an issue to me so she didnt touch into painful spot but her ego thought that thats my painful spot aka perfect spot to hit at, she thought I wanted to be like her, that I was jealous of her, that I felt like loser for not being like her, for not getting the attention she got from people, she was also ashamed of me, yeah, full on ashamed of me for simple me being me, I didnt like her as person but I loved her as sister so that did hurt bc it was coming from someone I cared and loved, someone I cared and loved wanted to hit me under the belt and to make me feel worse about myself, no matter if she didnt hit the spot, it did hurt that someone I loved was actively trying to ""shot me down"" in hopes to make themselves feel better and more powerful, but oh well what can I do about it other than feel hurt and cry, so I just kept to my side, I kept doing what I wanted and being me, something she hated bc she saw her effort at dragging me down & hurting me didnt work, I kept to myself, and was letting her be whatever she wanted, she didnt like the lack of attention from me and she didnt like me being better than her in school so she kept trying to break me down, trying to make me feel as loser, kept trying to make me hate myself, kept trying to ""make me better"", aka her, bc she thought everyone should be like her for them to not be a shame, and she wanted me to be her; for me to not keep embarassing her and for her to not feel ashamed of me..

Over the years, she kept changing tactics, from outright nasty and very explosive to silent & under the belt, when she would see that most of them didnt work, she would mostly lose the ones that made me keep her at the arms length, so she would try things like love bombing, hot and cold, suddenly agreeing, suddenly having the same opinions about things like me, suddenly being open and vulnerable about some things bc she knows I am empathic person, and etc, I would for most part ignore her & I also would stop sharing stuff about my life with her which made her lack knowledge, knowledge that she had to have to be able to target and attack me, in hopes of again having control of me, and she had to make me stop, at one point before she moved to live with her ex bf, when the abuse got worse, she had friends that behaved just like her, that also gave me her attitude and that were jealous at me for the same things she was, they expected me to just lie down like a good dog and take it, for them to be able to control and punish me when I ""misbehaved"", once I defended myself from their ""punishment"" & showed them their place they acted all like they are the real victims & that I am the villan who wants to do them harm bc ""I am jealous of them"", most people believed their shit bc ""sucha beautiful, hot, well known & nice girls cant be sucha a bad people, I, must be making that up outta my jealousy"".. That was from people that mostly used their d instead of their brain or that werent really smart.

I dont want my life to be in constant silent war zone & I dont want the replay of the past; so I am looking for advice on this lunacy.

So yeah, how do you deal with someone who wants you to give them advices (attention & validation), (but also to not bc often if you give them advice they go ooh dont be acting smarty pants with me, she is often using the line of me being smarty pants for almost everything (like I remember the word she cant remember in our convo and all of sudden I am acting like smarty pants and she feels the need to ""put me in my place"" about me doing something bad, its pathetic, lame and childlish, when she does that I often just look at her as if to ask her are you dumb or just pretending?))...

I dont really like fights so I dont start them but damn straight do I finish them when someone like her starts with their nonsense, I dont like drama to disturb my peace bc there are more ways to talk (calmly and openly) about something other than drama, in past I tried those with her but all she understands is dirty play, dramatic, childish, insulting ways to tell someone something, trying to harm and make someone feel bad, all bad shit, I defend myself and I dont hold my tongue when she starts but she doesnt like that so she starts with threats bc she doesnt like me ""talking back to her"", she is acting like my parent but also as if I am her slave, thats her behaviour since I can remember, it stopped for some time after she moved out, mainly bc she had others victims, also bc we were no contact, I cut her out my life, so when she saw that she changed tactics bc she no longer had her main victims attention and the way to get to her, so suddenly she apologized for everything, she didnt list everything she was sorry for, she and her bf moved closer so she had access again and she had the key of our childhood home, I still didnt trust her and didnt fall for her love bombing but I had some type of civil relationship just so there is no drama and no awkwardness, in begining she was all good and ""better than before"" but I could see thro most of it, but then few weeks ago the b returned to live in our childhood home and is again acting like her past immature self, the one that I cant stand, we had 3 fights, yeah real fights since she returned, she started every time with her bullshit, I did fight back and then she would attack me with her hands and I would fight back, and she lost every damn time from the start but still the heck, whats with that behaviour, I cant go to the police bc our police doesnt meddle in family problems and relationships, there were some really disturbing cases of family abuse and parents killing their children and themselves, there was also a case of a woman killing her sister and freezing her in her freezer of their childhood home; she kept her there 15 years until the blackout of electricity happened, body unfroze, started smelling and she was found & the sister was caught and is now in prison, the dead girl was conducted as missing; so yeah, police only reacted when there were dead bodies, when it was too late...

In past before she moved out I tried to involve police but yeah, it went on healthy but ""deaf"" ears, and also my mother wouldnt throw out her favourite child, after all she is hers golden child, even thro she is just chaos, trouble and poison (toxic) in a form of human.

So.. I am asking..

How do you deal with someone who wants to punish you when you dont listen to them, who says ""you are talking back"" when all you are trying is to defend yourself (something that you ""shouldnt do"" when dealing with them, according to them, yeah at one point she said that I deserve all the abuse I get bc I am ""talking back"" and I ""shouldnt"" talk back to her)....

She thinks she is my God, my hero, my everything; the one saving me from me being me and making bad decisions.

She thinks I should be grateful for her even giving me an ounce of her attention and her time.

How do you deal with someone who is full of crap and who wants all the control, someone who acts like all that, is normal & expected of you bc you are underneath them, and bc you arent being a good little slave to them when thats all that is expected of you, how to deal with someone who often punishes you with abuse or with threats of abuse; if you dont react and act how they want you, they often end up hitting or insulting you and when you fight back you are the villan and she is the victim, someone who thinks you are their slave that shouldnt ""talk back to them"" or even look at them wrong.

I am not person to attack first, I act only in self defense but this b is really testing my self control, bc all I want is to b#at her up for her behaviour.

Here I am hoping she messes with wrong person and gets her @@s handed back to her by that person & that she calms the hell down out of fear & embarrassment.

TLDR: older sister, golden child is using almost everything in the book of abusing to gain control and make someone a good sla/ve for personal gain and I am looking for advice on how to deal with her crap and ways to stay sane, also on what to do after I move out to keep her & others in my family similar to her out my life for good.",1,1,1747240696.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmjtue/problems_with_older_controling_possible_narc/

1kmenlm,New Dad Struggling With Changes in My Partner After Baby – Is This Normal or a Bigger Issue?,DryNefariousness7309,"I’m reaching out here because I feel completely stuck, and I'm hoping other parents, especially dads, might relate to what I’m going through. Since our son was born, life has obviously changed dramatically, as I expected. Lack of sleep, hormones, the sudden shift in priorities... all of it puts a huge strain on your relationship, and that's nothing new to anyone who's been through it. But one thing I didn’t really anticipate was the way my partner seems to have changed - not just in herself, but in how she relates to other people, particularly my side of the family.

I’ve tried to be supportive, patient, and understanding, but lately, it feels like I’m stuck between the family I was raised with and the family I’m trying to build. I don’t know whether to chalk it all up to postnatal changes, emotional overwhelm, or whether these are signs of something more permanent - maybe even a mental health concern or just a fundamental difference in values when it comes to family and parenting.

Some specific behaviors and conflicts have come up, and I’d really appreciate your thoughts on whether these are common or if I’m missing something important:

Photo Boundaries:
My partner gets really upset if friends or family take a photo of our son. I’ve never had an issue with this and grew up around people constantly snapping pictures. It feels like she’s being overly controlling sometimes, like she’s “gatekeeping” who gets to take or see photos of him.

Sharing Photos:
I’m also with her on not posting pictures of our son on social media - that was actually my idea - but if I send a picture to my mum and she forwards it to extended family (my nan, etc.), my partner sees it as a serious breach of trust and a safeguarding issue. I see it more as proud grandparents sharing joy. Is that such a bad thing?

Possessive Language:
She gets bothered if someone says things like “my boy” or “our baby” about our son. To me, it’s just a harmless, affectionate thing family say. She says it makes her feel like she had this baby for other people, not herself.

Distancing from Friends:
She’s cut off most of her friends who haven’t been in much contact since the birth. I figured they were just giving us space to settle into our family life, and honestly, none of my mates have really reached out either—but I didn’t take it personally.

Communication With My Family:
My partner was once close to my family but now thinks each of us should only coordinate plans with our own families. She doesn’t like it when my mum messages her directly, and I don’t understand that. I thought she was part of the family now and could talk to my parents without going through me.

Body Image & Intimacy:
She’s really struggling with how she looks post-pregnancy. She won’t be in photos, she avoids intimacy, and she gets offended when my dad says things like “you’re looking lovely” in a completely harmless way. I think he means well, but she just shuts down. I’ve tried reassurance, but nothing I say or do seems to help.

Distrust Toward My Family:
She says she doesn’t trust my family to watch our son, but is totally fine leaving him with her mum. I find this so unfair as I know my family would do a great job.

Forgiveness: My mum kissed our son when he was a newborn, which my partner was furious about. But we never laid down that boundary beforehand. My mum was simply unaware of the dangers, as are over half of UK parents acoroing to a poll. I see it as a learning moment that we were to blaim for, as we did not clearly state this beforehand. My son was fine thankfully but my partner says it is unforgivable and the things people say or do in the early stages of motherhood are never forgotten?

Visitors & Time Together:
She doesn’t like having visitors over, even though I’m totally fine with family popping in. I get that we’re building our own family now and need space, but at the same time, her mum is over way more than anyone else. Our son needs his other grandpartents in his life as well, so it just feels inconsistent.

Not Letting Others Hold Him:
She doesn’t like anyone else holding our son, even for a short time. She says she hates when he comes back smelling like someone else. That one honestly just seems excessive to me.

Routine Over Everything:
She’s militant about our sons routine. I respect that, and it does work, but it also means she’ll cancel plans with family or skip planned days out just to keep the schedule intact. I’d rather risk a rough night and go make some memories together, but for her, the routine comes first.

Lack of Connection:
She’s not interested in going on dates or even planning short breaks anymore. I know things are harder with a baby, but I still want us to have that time. It feels like we’ve lost “us,” and she doesn’t seem to want it back.

Hostility Toward My Mum and Dad:
This one really hurts. She gives my family cold responses, avoids eye contact, and it’s created so much tension. My fmaily love her to bits and are so upset that she doesnt seem to like them anymore. I get that some of this stems from some of the points mentioned above, but do they merit being rude and distant? She’d never act that way toward her own family.

I guess what I’m trying to say is: I love my partner and she’s an amazing mum and she’s gone through a lot. But the way she’s been handling relationships - especially with my side of the family - is really weighing me down. We’ve talked and argued about it many times, and I still feel stuck.

I honestly don’t know:
• Are these just normal post-baby behaviors that pass with time?
• Is this a sign of anxiety, trauma, or deeper emotional stuff that needs professional help?
• Or is this just who she is now - and I need to either accept it or walk away?

I don’t want to be the insensitive guy who doesn’t get it. I also don’t want to give up on my family or keep defending behaviors that feel isolating and unfair. So if you’ve been through anything like this or have any advice on how to handle it then I’d really appreciate hearing your experience. I’m standing at a crossroads right now and could really use some outside perspective.",5,27,1747227898.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmenlm/new_dad_struggling_with_changes_in_my_partner/
1kmdqja,Is the way my dad treats me justifiable or partially my fault?,Resident-Revenue6358,"Hello! I hope this is okay to post here. So I (18F) have had issues with my dad (48M) pretty much my whole life. I am not sure why, I think part of the reason is because we are very similar and also there is a lot of pre-existing baggage. But I dunno. I wanna know if im part of the problem too since I can't really recognise it in myself and everyone I have talked to about it are biased in my favour so it would help to have an unbiased perspective on this.

My memory is very poor but I will do the best I can. 
I don't remember much of my childhood, but I remember I had a lot of issues when I was young. I was a very angry and often violent autistic child, and he dealt with it on ways that. I think messed me up in some ways. The two main things I remember are him physically sitting on my and restraining me, and also removing the lock from my door. (This is when I was under 11 btw and he has done this again recently when im 18, I will get to that) I mean, I don't know what he could've done but I really don't think this was the answer
Also he was always very touchy with me and hugged me and grabbed me when I always made it very clear how much I hated that. And he refused to respect my boundaries, he seemed to think he was entitled to physical affection from me when that's just not how I am at all

He was always one of those very punishment-centred parents. If I didn't do what he wanted he'd take things away from me. I think it's been pretty obvious my whole life that that parenting style is very much to my detriment but he refuses to change.
I really feel like he has very little consideration for me or my emotions 
I really wish I could do a better job at describing all this but unfortunately I mainly only remember the ways they hurt me and not the context. But. Is any of this stuff justifiable? 

But here is something that has been happening recently that I do remember better. I dropped out of 11th grade and am unemployed, since I struggled a lot with school and basically executive dysfunction is holding me back from everything in my life lol. Admittedly I am very lazy and do not like helping in the house at all and he has been. Pretty harsh on forcing me to do it lately, which. Here are some of the things he's done:

-taken my phone for a week

-took the doorknob off my bedroom door again. when I was 18

-tried to take it off A SECOND TIME

-threatened to take my yarn away (crocheting is one of my 2 hobbies)

-took away the family ipad until I changed my ""attitude"" (I use it to draw, my other hobby, it really seems stupid to punish me by taking away the few productive things I do)

-guilt tripped me about my mum having a rough time

-installed a parental app on my phone to limit my internet. again, I am 18

-regularly threatens to take my phone

-randomly wrenched my phone out of my hand while I was talking to my mum because he decided I hadn't done enough

-oh. yeah. he literally wrestles me to take my phone when I try to resist and does not care that he hurts me 

-pointed out the kid who lives next to me (who is the same age as me) who helps with the construction zone next door the whole day, insinuating I am a failure for not being the same 

-likes to insinuate that I am manipulative and abusive. TO HIM

okay yeah this sounds bad. but I am very stubborn and unhelpful, I do understand to a degree but he takes it much too far I think. 
ok yeah this has become very ranty I apologise. 
Just. I know he grew up in a very traditional family who was far worse than this. Is this some sort of generational trauma thing? Is any of this justifiable? Is he just. Straight up abusive or am I part of the problem too?
sorry this really turned into a massive rant oops thank you for reading this if you did

oh no how the hell do I write a tldr for this

TLDR: My dad has done some seriously messed up stuff to me but I am unsure if I am part of the problem too, or if it is unjustifiable

1kmd1cg,How do I properly deal with my younger (teen) sister?,Bulky_Display_3701,"A short story time.

I am the eldest of three siblings. My second sister is a special child while the youngest is 15 years old. 

There are certain times when my 2nd sister becomes aggressive or throws super bad tantrums. It happens basically almost everyday. When this happens, most of the time we just allow her to calm down on her or own or just give her whatever she wants. My mom being a mom is protective of my sister. She hates it when we fight our sister back or say something bad about her. My mom is always on her side since no one can defend my sister but us. Which I truly understand.


Due to this, my youngest sister admitted that she feels like our parents has a favorite child - which is our second sister. 

I keep on telling her that it is only because our sister is a special child and should always back her up. However, I don’t think she understands what I am trying to say. She becomes to self-centered. We are having a hard time communicating with her. When we engage with her, her response are either “nods”, “grunts”, or she does not respond at all. Her responses makes by boil blood and leads to saying awful things I shouldn’t have said.

My patience is at its limits already. I want to understand and communicate with her. 

What are the things that I should do as an older sister? How should I communicate with her?

1kmcg5h,"Estranged Father reacquainted after Lewy Body Dimentia diagnosis, what do I want?",Lostinsadness83,"My parents split (dad was unfaithful) when I was 6 and my mum moved my 2 sisters and I back to the UK from Australia. My father stayed in Australia and remarried soon after the divorce (to the mistress) was finalised. He went on to have another daughter (10 years later) followed by a son a couple of years later. 

He visited a few times before his daughter was born, twice on his own and once with his new wife as part of a trip they were taking around Europe, last time was 97 when my nephew was born. 

For the next 11 years he didn’t visit at all and maintenance was as paid intermittently at the minimum rate. We lived on a very tight budget and my mum worked full time which meant me and sisters would often have to fend for ourselves from an early age (9 ish). When asked to contribute to things like school trips he refused. Meanwhile in the land down under he lived in an affluent suburb in a large 5 bedroom house with a swimming pool, 2 cars and the children went to private school and university fees were paid. 

He returned to the uk briefly when his brother passed away and we had some time together although I felt very reluctant to let him into my life as at this point I had a 2 yr old and was heavily pregnant with my 2nd. 

His next visit was with his whole family in 2012 when again I met with him and spent time with his wife and my half siblings.

My half sister moved to England for a year in 2015 and in that time he visited her twice with his wife.

I hadn’t spoken to him since 2015 after he slammed the phone down on me because my son wasn’t available to chat too as we were hosting his birthday party at home and it was chaos, he never contacted me not I him after that.

I cut contact with my half sister as I found her tactless and completely ignorant to the fact her perfect dad was my estranged dad.

I have had a good friendship with my half brother for a few years and he is as appalled with how my sisters and I were treated as I am.

2 months ago I got a letter (via my brother) from my dad apologising for the way he has treated me and hoping to come and visit as he has Lewy Body Dementia and time is running out.

He arrived last Wednesday (a week ago) and although we have met up nearly every day with him and my brother (came to care for him) he is yet to apologise to any of us. We just meet up and chat about life then leave. I’m starting to panic there is only a week left of their visit and all I am getting from this experience is more heartache. 

What do I do? Play nice and let him die thinking all in the garden is Rosie or do I bring it up? 

If you have made it this far reading I thank you for your time and would appreciate any advice you can offer.

1kmc4sh,How to build relationship with my sister advice,TopTask3827,"I 25M live in Thailand and my sister 23F lives in London with my mum. 

Our parents had a very unstable relationship and split when I was 10, while growing up this led me and my sister to grow apart when I was often left more with my dad and my sister with my mum. 

Now that we are older I have built a good relationship with both my parents, although there are still unresolved feelings on my side I just deal with them. My parents are not perfect people but they try their best and I have grown up to understand this. 

However my sister has refused to speak with my dad for almost a year now and in addition her relationship with mum has ups & downs. She also replies with me only intermittently and right now hasn’t the last 2 weeks. I desperately want to help her and build a better relationship but it’s hard when I live on the other side of the world and she often won’t respond.

Does anyone have any advice or tips I could try to rebuild with her? 

I also am very conscious of the growing distance between her and my dad and want to help them both fix it.

1kmbg4b,AITAH for not helping my brother on his hospital bills?,bittersweet_1995,"my brother and I has always had a bad relationship with each other. he insulted me countless times and when I trusted him with some errands he would lie to me and scam me. he always get away with it because our parents always side with him (and our youngest brother) at the expense of me and my older sister's peace.

he did the same to our oldest sister. he was entrusted with money and instead, he fled away and used the money. he was not scolded nor was made accountable for his actions. also, he told bad things to our sister so she also cut him off and never spoke to him again. 

a few days ago, my mother called telling us that my brother was in the hospital for an emergency surgery and needed funds. i called my sister and she was not willing to fill it in since she wants him to take accountability for his actions. he's already 26 years old and fully capable of working. i share the same sentiments and decided not to help him as well. our parents are mad at us, saying he's still our brother but we kept on explaining that they have to let him stand up on his own and they cannot baby him all the time. now they're calling us names for not helping.

are we the assholes for this? or are our actions valid?

ps: years ago, this same brother went abroad to study and when his plans messed up, our parents blackmailed us to buy him ticket to go home (yes, threatened us that they would not receive medical care if we don't help our brother). so my sister got him home. comes months after when they have conflict in the house (since my brother has been giving them a hard time) and our parents blamed my sister for getting him home. 😅 that's why my sister doesn't want to help him anymore.

pps: i even suggested to my parents that he can try to ask government organizations for help on the medical bills but they don't want to since they want him out of the hospital asap and doesn't want to process the necessary documents needed. they even told me they don't want to talk to us anymore.",2,7,1747217229.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kmbg4b/aitah_for_not_helping_my_brother_on_his_hospital/

1kma0m3,No idea what to do,Individual-Anxiety,"I have been with my wife for 16 years (married for 6 months). Over our time together my mother has been awful to her and it came to a head at our wedding. Her and my dad were the only 2 guests I was nervous about. They turned up blind drunk out of nerves as they are both socially inept.

The night ended with my mum trying to take my son home and as we didn't agree the abuse started towards my wife. This ended in her screaming the C word at my wife.

We have not spoken much obviously since, I did not buy her a mother's day card which now my brother has fallen out with me over. My sister also does not speak to the family due to my mother and her actions.

My mother and father are quilting me about seeing my children but my wife understandably wants them no where near them.

Before all this they were good grand parents but spoiled my kids too much.

I am in the middle of my wife, my parents, my brother and my kids as they want to see my parents.

I have no idea what to do, I've stood my ground with the family and stood by my wife btw.

TLDR: tyrannical mother has split the family up and been a horror to my wife the whole time we have been together and very nearly ruined our wedding day.

1km9ywh,I want to recconect.,tiredsoufle,"I've been  suffering with depression for 4 years since I was 12, and I've only recently managed to heal. I'm now realising how much of a mess my familial relationships are. 

Back when I was depressed, I locked myself away in my room all the time, I avoided everyone and ignored texts, and family invitations. I also pushed them away because I felt I didn't deserve their care.

Naturally, relationships with my family faded away, to the point I don't even feel like I'm related anymore . And I think they gave up on me because I was such a burden.

I also said a lot of things I didn't mean like 'I hate you' and 'I can't love anyone', I never meant it tho :c. What can I do to prove I didn't mean that?

However, now I feel I am ready to become a good part of the family again. And I really want to recconnect because I miss and love them. 💔

I accepted an invitation to spend a day out with my dad a few days ago, after not seeing him for a year (we don't live in the same state anymore, and the last time we had talked I was really mean and bitter. But I've changed for the better.). He showed me kindness and accepted my apology, even though I still feel so guilty and I know just saying sorry isn't going to be enough.

I'm already thinking of paying off my both literal and non-literal debts once I get a job , but that's a bit shallow. I want to integrate back into my family, I want to show I can be trusted again, and I won't be a burden child anymore. 

I want to be a better daughter and sister, because I know I haven't been these past few years and the guilt is eating me alive.

I'm a big Christmas person so i bought everyone nice gifts, helped with the food (and send money as well) and was there early to help clean and organize the house (we're latinos so it's a big event for us and all our relatives come). So, the clock is turning into six o'clock and no one had talked to me yet. I don't think they were ignoring me on purpose or with any malicious intent, but i felt really left out of all the conversations and was designed only one person jobs instead of groups activities, but i tried not to care too much about it. After that, it was dinner time and we set up a big table outside with all the food and plates, i filled up my plate and took a seat at the table and a distant cousin did the same. 
The problem was, no one but us were sitting there. My sisters and cousins were all inside together and my grandma and aunties set up another table for them. I was a little awkward not knowing where to go as i was already eating, my cousin who was sitting with me was called by my grandma (who is his aunt) to sit there with her, but she didn't do the same with me. He said he wasn't going to as he was doing me company and they told him to come anyways.
Thankfully he didn't or i would have broken down in tears right there. 
After that, it was desert time and honestly i was not in the mood for sweets, i ate a little bit and was feeling nauseous already. Everyone then started saying that i was too ""fancy"" to eat their desert. I was unsure of what to say so i just listened quietly. 
When it was time to open presents I was super excited, i wasn't really expecting anything so i was happy when my grandma gave me a t-shirt. I really enjoy seeing people happy about the presents i bought so it was fine. But then everyone was talking to each other at the same time and i didn't know how to participate. I started to become real anxious wich made everything harder. And then my grandma told me my auntie was going to sleep in the spare bedroom (wich is usually mine every year) and they were talking about how I'd have no place to sleep. 
Maybe i was reading too much into it but I felt like my presence was less important, and this really shocked me. Christmas is my favorite holidays cause i love to spend time together, eating and cooking, exchanging presents and stories, but this year i did none of those things. 
I then said i was going back home and everyone was upset, questioning me on why wouldn't i sleep there, and saying if i wanted i could have the bed, but I knew it wasn't possible as my aunt doesn't even own a car, so she couldn't go home. And i really wanted to cry all that bad feelings out in my bedroom. And that's what I did. 
After that, I asked about New years eve and my grandma said she was going to do something. They didn't invite me, but i saw the pics on her ig. 
It's already may now but I haven't comeback to visit yet. We talked on the phone a few times but i still feel really hurt about this event, and am afraid of going and being ignored all over again. 
I really miss them and my sisters, but no one is trying to talk to me or reach me out. My birthday is coming and I'm really scared of not getting any calls. I know I should just go and deal with this, but the anxiety drives me nuts everytime i think about it. 
Am I a drama queen for still feeling hurt about something that was months ago?

While we still lived in Voldemorts home, my mom met her now husband, who we will call Viking (because he looks like one) so, naturally Viking hates Voldemorts guts, and he’s really insecure, he thinks my mom was hiding things from him and all that, which my mom isn’t.

So last year at the beginning i went NC with Voldemort because of some personal things, last week he texted me and told me that he wanted to meet up because my grandma (his mom) has cancer (it wasn’t as bad as i expected, she’s still in her very early stages) so we met up yesterday to go eat and talk about some of my achievements , and i told my mom that i didn’t want to get in trouble with Viking because even if he isn’t my parent he is still someone i consider close and i didn’t want him to be mad that i went out with Voldemort, i find out he checked my location (we use iPhone, so on find me.) and scolded my mom, calling her a liar and that she knew that i was going out with Voldemort, which she didn’t.

And now my mom called me this morning to tell me that Viking checked my location and he’s really mad because i met up with Voldemort, i’m a little scared of what he will do, even if he’s never threatened me with nothing, i still feel guilty for doing it, am i in the wrong?",1,2,1747199858.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1km7b7m/am_i_in_the_wrong/

1km5tiw,Dysfunctional family?,throwaway389331,"TW: discussion of sensitive topics 

I’m going to start with my parents: 

My father is in his early 70s, and my mom is in her mid-50s. I’m 19.

My father: 

* Landed our family into huge debt (at least 50k+ worth of debt) before I was even born, it was with good intentions (he bought and tried to run a supermarket, he wanted his children to have something to inherit), but it was REALLY naive and he didn’t do research beforehand so his gamble failed.
* Okay, so he used my mother’s credit to pull out loans for the supermarket, presumably, and that destroyed my mom’s credit. Even 10 years after the whole debt thing happened, she had trouble renting apartments and probably couldn’t get a mortgage due to her low credit, etc. 
* Kept job hopping when I was a kid (my mom said the reasons for job hopping were petty, and I did hear about an incident in which he argued with his boss), could not accumulate savings. 
* Had 3 strokes. Last one made him physically disabled 2 years ago; he refused to seek medical care either because he thought it would be expensive (we told him he had medicare insurance) or he thought he could recover on his own. He can’t work anymore and is retired, contributes to the family via his Social Security, and occasionally cooks. I’ve had to cook breakfast for him almost every day since that happened (I also occasionally cook dinner or help to cook dinner). All of this at the cost of my time.  
* Alcoholic, even now (at least 1 cup of sake per day). In the past, he used to get upset if I couldn’t bring him back champagne on the day he wanted it. My mom said he almost died once due to alcohol poisoning (he drank because that was the custom when you worked in a restaurant environment back then), but that was at least 2 decades ago. 
* My parents used to argue a lot back then, and some of the arguments were so bad that my dad would exhibit suicidal behavior or threaten to commit suicide (police were called 2-3 times), and I saw these things before I even turned 18. I used to have nightmares about it and still do, even if it’s rare now. I remember when I was a kid (10-11), I lied to my dad about doing my homework, and when he caught me, he locked me out of the house until my mom intervened (I don’t remember all of it). 
* My mother is the one who pays for the rent, utility bills, etc., not him. He has disregarded my mom’s physical condition at times (my mom has hypertension). 
* I’ve helped him handle paperwork before. I helped him sell his car, helped him book flights, etc. I can excuse some of this due to him being unfamiliar with using computers. 
* Okay, I remember: there was a time when my mom put her elbows on the dinner table while eating, which made my dad very angry, so he shouted at her to remove her elbows from the table. My mom reacted by just leaving the dinner table all together and made a comment that was something like “you don’t pay rent, you don’t get to tell me what to do” and then the morning after that my dad went to me and was like “you need to educate her on how to be American.” 
* He sometimes thinks that the unintentional mistakes my mom made were intentional. 
* Used to get upset at my mom for not being on time, still does.
* I took him to a clinic a few days ago (5/6/25), and when he was at the clinic, he was impatient and anxious. When his blood pressure was checked, it read 163/110, so really bad (high stroke risk). He coped and denied that it was a problem, said he was just nervous in hospital-like settings, and that sitting down constantly made it rise. Said that if he had to wait longer for the doctor, he would leave. Very disappointing experience for me. 
* Expects me to give my opinion on things when I’ve watched him have the most intense arguments with my mother

My mother: 

* Believes in QAnon and other conspiracy theories (this started around 2021). I suspect it’s a coping mechanism because she couldn’t make sense of what was happening in the world, and also due to our family’s financial instability (she was buying “Trump dollars” because she thought they would grow in value), due to my father being retired, and her self-employment. 
* My mother wants to pursue her project of starting a YouTube channel (I’m NOT JOKING) and then has to balance her work with that too (she said she hates her work now due to how stressful it is), so now she’s asking me to help with paperwork (yes, I do get paid, but not according to regular rates and usually out of nowhere). Some of it is stressful because of deadlines, and I can’t get anything wrong in the paperwork (she works in immigration law).
* My mom is in medical debt. At least 10k+. She accumulated the debt after she went to the hospital due to SVT, and then she asked me to sign her up for Medi-Cal retroactive coverage. I helped her fill out applications that I barely understood (I was like 17-18, but yeah), and we were denied because there was contradictory information in the application, and my mom didn’t bother applying again since that happened. 
* I’ve had pretty bad allergies, and my mom always said she would take me to the doctor eventually, but never did. Probably because neither of us has medical insurance coverage.
* My mom genuinely doesn’t see any value in my college education. She has told me that I’m learning “fake things” and that my education doesn’t matter, and then disregards the time I use for my studies.
* My mom won’t let me take the bus unless she’s with me. Afraid I’ll get “human-trafficked”. 
* When I was a kid, my mom would tell me to talk to my dad for her, and I did make dumb mistakes like omitting something because I was afraid my dad would respond poorly, or being vague, and this would result in miscommunication. But the whole reason why she asked me to talk to him was because she didn’t want to. 
* Lacks a strong sense of time, possibly severe time-blindness.
* Good news: my mother sympathizes with me and says I should have been allowed to go do things that every other kid was doing after graduating, instead of being confined to rigid schedules and being at home, taking care of my father. 
* Hasn’t paid her car registration fees since 2021, probably around 1k+. Also hasn’t paid her taxes since 2017. 
* An actual sovereign citizen: believes the US is under admiralty law and not common law, believes a license/registration isn’t necessary to drive. 

Both: 

* They’re both telling me to get a job, learn how to drive (I have until May to get my driver’s license).
* They didn’t ask me to take online classes, but I did it because I knew my mom would make me late for classes (she’s busy and doesn’t have time to drive 30 minutes to drop me off). I also needed more time to take care of my dad initially. 
* They didn’t ask me to sacrifice my dreams, but I did anyway because I know that when my mom retires, both of my parents probably won’t be able to afford a comfortable retirement, even with SSA, because we live in California. I wanted to pursue my dreams of being an artist/writer, but I pushed them aside in favor of a more financially stable career field: accounting. Something that will probably make me miserable long term. 
* Both are experiencing health issues that require them to either stop working or work less: my dad with his physical disability, my mom with her hypertension (high blood pressure). 
* My mother told me that she stayed with my father despite the intense arguments and stuff (they are completely incompatible) because she wanted me to have a father, but I’d literally rather be fatherless than have this. My mother has casually said things like “If he died, we would be better off” in her native language, so he doesn’t hear it. 

What about me?: 

* Extremely burnt out, as of 5/10/2025, I dropped my classes because I was failing them, and I didn’t have time for them anymore. I will try again next semester. 

Current conditions: 

* Living paycheck to paycheck basically 
* My mother is looking for jobs for both of us for the sake of financial stability (fixed wage)
* I’m trying to get medical insurance for our family and IHSS for my dad

TLDR: I didn't consciously consider whether my family was dysfunctional or not because all my family's toxic behavior was normalized in my mind",1,1,1747194476.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1km5tiw/dysfunctional_family/
1km5ijt,Am i a weirdo?,FunConfection5847,"Hi Redditors,  
I'm a graduate student from Asia, and I’ve been struggling with something for a long time that I’d like to ask for your insight on.  
Before I get into the details, I want to mention that English is not my first language. Although I’ve tried to polish the text with GPT, I apologize for any mistakes that may remain.

In my family, there’s my dad, mom, and an older sister. While we don’t have much money, we’ve always been a warm and close-knit family. I’ve always trusted my family deeply, and they’ve been the support that’s helped me get through graduate school.  
Especially my sister—she has always been my emotional anchor. We used to talk about everything, from what we ate each day to our thoughts on love and relationships. I felt I could trust her with anything, and I believed she would never hide anything from me (at least, that’s how it used to be a year ago).

But everything changed about a year ago.  
I started noticing that she seemed distracted whenever we talked. I often had to repeat myself once or twice before she would understand and respond, and she would suddenly ask unrelated or random questions.  
At first, I thought maybe she was just dealing with something stressful. Later, I found out that she had started dating her first boyfriend at school (she’s still pursuing further studies).  
The thing is—I only learned about it *after* they had been together for a while. In fact, I was one of the last people in the family to find out.  
I’m not sure whether she intentionally kept it from me or not, but from that moment on, it felt like my world started falling apart.  
It crushed me to realize that someone I had trusted so completely—someone I would never have hidden anything from—had hidden something so important from me.  
Since then, I’ve become emotionally unstable. I started questioning everything related to her. But that wasn’t even the worst part.

I used to think that while I wasn’t particularly outstanding, at least I was a normal person.  
But since then, I’ve started having unwanted thoughts and vivid images of my sister being intimate with another man.  
I can’t stand it.  
It feels unbearable that there’s a side of her I’ll never get to see, that someone else—a man—gets to experience a version of her that I never will.  
These thoughts have started to deeply interfere with my life.  
I can’t focus on my studies.  
Even seeing a message or photo related to my sister makes me feel irritated and overwhelmed.  
And I honestly don’t even know whether what I’m feeling is some kind of protective instinct as a family member, or something more inappropriate—a possessiveness toward her as a woman.

Eventually, after living under this mental pressure for so long, I decided to talk to her about it.  
I told her that I might have developed feelings for her that aren’t appropriate for siblings, and that I couldn’t treat her the same way I used to before she had a boyfriend—but I also told her I would *never* act inappropriately or cross a line.  
She didn’t judge or ridicule me.  
She said maybe it was just because I had spent too much of my life in male-dominated engineering environments and hadn’t had much interaction with women.  
She said I wasn’t a ""weirdo.""  
She also explained that she’s shy about romantic matters, which is why she didn’t talk to me about it.  
But what I still don’t understand is: why, when she used to say I was the family member she trusted the most, was I not the first person she told?  
She even said that she talks to her boyfriend about family problems.  
How is it that someone she just started dating gets to know about our family issues, while I—the one she used to trust the most—didn’t even know she was in a relationship?

If things had ended there, maybe I could have slowly worked through it and recovered.  
But recently, at a family dinner, I found out *at the last moment* that she had invited her boyfriend to join us.  
Even when friends invite someone to dinner, they usually ask if everyone is okay with it in advance—because not everyone is comfortable eating with strangers.  
But none of my family, not even my sister, considered how I might feel.  
It made me feel like there was no one in the world I could trust anymore.  
I was in so much pain, but I still forced myself to attend the dinner.  
Seeing her and her boyfriend being affectionate, laughing together—it was suffocating.  
Afterward, the disturbing fantasies I had started having about her and other men became even clearer and more intense.  
I now frequently have nightmares about her and her boyfriend mocking me, and I’ve been struggling with insomnia.  
In the daytime, the intrusive thoughts worsen, and I can’t accomplish anything—just endless pain.

So, I ask you, kind Redditors:  
Am I truly some kind of sick weirdo who wants an incestuous relationship with my sister?  
How can I process these emotions?  
How can I get my life back on track?  
I feel completely lost and hopeless.",1,1,1747193466.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1km5ijt/am_i_a_weirdo/

I've always hoped that my mom could move closer to me and be a part of her grand daughter's life. However, I don't see anything changing, mom will continue to be a caretaker for my sister and they will live together and make each other unhappy for the next 20 years until one of them has a health decline that forces a change.  Meanwhile we will see them twice a year at holidays that will be moderately miserable because being around my sister is stressful and volatile.

1km2t8l,Father is slowing down,Filmpanther_Mary,"My dad, (M72) has slowed down considerably over the last couple of years. I know that this comes naturally with getting older, but he is a lot slower than many of my family members who are his age or older, including his own brother who is about 7 years older than he is. When I say slow, I mean both physically and mentally. My dad talks slow, and moves slow - sometimes taking a long while just to reach into his pocket to retrieve his car keys. 

There is some dementia concern as his mother had dementia, but my parents have been to a neurologist and the doctor says he is not currently showing signs. My dad also recently had hip surgery (his hip as been bothering him for years.) We'd hope this would put a pep back in his step, but now he is complaining about aches and pains all over his body. He did work a physical job for most of his life, which is probably contributing to the pains he feels now.

Does anyone have advice or experience of a relative who is slowing down, at an age that seems too young in my opinion. Any tips? Any medical advice, whether it be alternative or not?

I think my family is just at a loss at what we should do next. If there is anything we can look into or test to help my dad.

1km1tdu,Over 10 years my sister (30) trying to get rid of family?,Jar1785,"This whole situation started around 10 years ago and just got more out of hand in recent years (especially within the past 3-4 years).

About 10 years ago, my sister started this whole thing by cutting out our father. From what I hear about, is that my sister was calling my father to ask him something about our half-brother's wedding that we were attending back in 2013. Apparently our father answered the call in a tone that she didn't like. She got mad from that and sometime within the year, she cut him off entirely. Our father still doesn't know why she won't talk to him 12 years later! Myself, our mother, our stepfather at the time, half-sister, half-brother, sister-in-law and her own husband all wanted for her to at least try to contact our father, all failed attempts.

Things were calm for years until 2021. Our older half-sister was getting married, and a few months before the wedding, she and the older half-sister got into an argument about something I don't know (I'm not going to put words in mouth if I don't know what those words were). One thing lead to another and eventually, our brother-in-law was somehow dragged into the argument. Luckily, the wedding went off without a hitch, but my sister hasn't tried to contact the older half-sister since then. Our older half-sister as tried to reach out and wanted to make attempts to talk things out, but she was not responding, eventually our older half-sister stopped trying. 

Next was 2022. The year she got married. And her next cut. We have a half-brother who lives out of state, and she asked me for his phone number to wish him a happy birthday and to ask when the next time he will be in state will be. He did not respond until that night. But that was all it took. She never made another attempt to reach out to him again, she did not even invite him to her wedding!

Leading up to her own wedding, our mother and stepfather at the time, were rocky in their relationship (ended up filing for divorce about a month later). However, our mom basically had to convince her to invite our half-sister to the wedding. The half-sister did come, but only for the ceremony. Which brings up the next cut, our niece, the half-sister's daughter. When planning the wedding, our niece was promised to be a flower girl. About a month out, she decided to switch our niece out for her husband's nieces who lived about three hours away. Our niece got mad from that, and now wants nothing to do with my sister.

Now 2023. In the beginning of the year, our mother was going to take a vacation, I lived with our mother at the time and we had a dog. One thing I should mention is that our mother and stepfather at the time, paid for her wedding and their eventual honeymoon. So our mother said that she will forget the money that they paid, if she would help me take care of the dog while I was at work. Everything was going well at first, then one day she messages me while I was at work (I work evening and nights) saying that she wasn't going to take care of the dog anymore. I was currently on the clock and almost 30 minutes from the house. When I got home, the dog was in a dark house, almost no water and did his business in the living room. No explanation on why she just decided to stop. She just did. I was lucky to have a good friend who lives close by to come by and took care of the dog while I was gone.

Lastly, early 2025. While myself and her were not on speaking terms, the dog got sick. Our mother was out of state at the time and she had to beg for her to help me transport the dog to the vet (where we unfortunately had to put the dog down). She messaged me the next day to see how I was doing, I said I was good and what I did that day. Got nothing in return. She went back to her old ways. I've reached out to her and still got nothing.

TLDR: That was about six family members that she ended up cutting out her life (father, half-sister, half-brother, niece, mother & myself) for weird, puzzling or no reasons at all. I still have her contact info, but I've tried to reach out and not doing it again. If she does reach out, I will answer, but I tried extending an olive branch and my arm is getting tired from holding it.",1,2,1747182038.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1km1tdu/over_10_years_my_sister_30_trying_to_get_rid_of/
1km0tru,My dad has no faith in me at all (RANT),anon92839,"I just turned 18 in March and ever since then, my dad won't stop making comments about me ""not having any potential"" and just other comments that are just him trying to bring me down. 

At first I brushed it off. Me and him never had the best relationship and he has definitely said worse comments towards me in the past. But now it has become an almost daily thing and it's getting harder to simply brush off. Every day he finds a small failure of mine (from both past or present) and puts it against me. It could be something stupid I did in middle school or something from yesterday. Either way he makes me feel stupid.

What really pushed me to write this post was something that happened a few weeks ago but has been stuck in my mind. He called me and told me that he cancelled my whole entire senior trip and told me that I ""didn't deserve to have one because I'm not going to graduate anyways"" (spoiler: I am in fact graduating lol). I started crying because it was something I was looking forward to for MONTHS and he didn't give me any warning. I asked him why he thinks I won't graduate and he outright told me that he doesn't think I will get that far then said he doesn't have any faith in me anymore. I hung up immediately and I can't seem to get those words out of my own head even weeks later.

From a logical standpoint, I do realise that it probably comes from a place of jealousy. He graduated high school, dropped out of college, and now has a classic 9-5 job he hates and barely gets by on. I am taking a gap year to work a full-time job then attending UIUC for meteorology in fall 2026. 

But even from that logical perspective, I still feel terrible. The comments never seem to stop and they are starting to get exhausting to deal with.

My dilemma is that now I can afford to be more generous, but should I be. She wasted so many opportunities that came her way, and I have worked so hard to get into the position I’m now in. Her and her partner both smoke weed, and I think if I helped her out with a bit of cash that it’d be wasted. 

But my poor nieces and nephews. 

I need either suggestions of how I can best help them, or a stern talking to about how she’s made her bed and to let her lie in it",2,1,1747172573.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klycbw/need_an_outside_perspective/
1klxkzg,My sleep [23F] is getting greatly disturbed by my cousins [40M] pets and sleeping habits,yhnmkkutesdcv,"I have tried to be very stoic about this and not let this get to me as well as gracious as I have been taken in by my aunty [70F] and my cousin since my parents got greatly abusive and neglectful for the last 6 years over things about me. I've known these people all my life and some of all of theirs.

Not giving me stable ground to study so I could of become better equipped to be more independent. That could be a whole post in itself.

But since I've moved in. My sleep has been greatly disturbed. My cousin has severe sleep apnea because of his weight (that he doesn't acknowledge, waking up every hour) and health issues and excessive alcohol consumption (1 liter of spirits then another strong 4pk in usually all nighters), unregulated heavy fast food consumption.

 Not only this has been a bad influence on me. What I'm trying to make sure I fight indulging myself. He is suffering from bad health issues like struggling to walk and obsessive swelling in his feet that he won't get checked out with a doctor.

He wakes up through the night easily 6+ times stomping near my door but as well as that stays up till weird hours but takes the dogs out the front litterally at 7AM in the morning. Slamming the screen door and his 3 little dogs excessively barking. They also bark all throughout the night.

They never get walked. I'm the only one who has walked them in a 6 month period. 

I have been asking him regularly if he's gone to see the doctor about the swelling in his legs but keeps putting it off over the last 3 months, a simple checkup. He gets really overwhelmed. Doesn't work. I feel like asking him to get the dogs better trained and to try to keep it down but once again. Im trying to be polite about it all since him and my aunty took Me in.

It doesn't help we have cars with loud exhausts and kids on illegal motorbikes rev bombing the shit out near the house but that can't be helped

But its starting to effect my own sleep patterns badly, I'm not functioning well at work, I'm headachey and lacking sleep all the time now when I used to be a grade A sleeper. I worry as I have my own issues health wise that are getting worse because of this, what could cost me thousands in the future if I dont keep it regulated and give myself the best chance. I feel like I haven't been clear headed enough to make decisions. I don't feel like im adjusting the the environment sleep wise. My mental health has been terrible with the lack of sleep as well.

My aunty does watch her shows really loud when she is home on the weekends til late but I'm kind of used to that due to my brother [14m] used to have his TV playing full ball all night to help him sleep. The white noise was enough to drown it out besides once or twice 

I'm also worried that in a few weeks that my other cousin [30(ish)f] is going to be living with us with her 3 kids [5M] [8M] [13M] although they are usually pretty good at keeping quiet see enough when they sleep over besides maybe a movie. So meh. I also worry because me and my aunty are the only people that work in the house if you don't count being a full time mum what is a job in itself.

So I guess the main issue is my 40yo cousin and his habits. Doesn't help our rooms are side by side

I already sleep with my fan on for white noise. Try to go to bed at regular times. I used to supplement with weed but sober nowadays. Sometimes listen to those sleep videos on YouTube on the loud days even though it doesnt drown it out. I also been thinking about sleeping with ear plugs after getting awoken again tonight and eye mask. It's a small house already and all the rooms are taken up

Failing that. I'll think I need to just bite the bullet and move out although I basically relocated to this rural town since my parents abuse. Including jobs.

What should I do? I'm kinda lost for ideas on what could help my situation besides above

TL:DR - my cousin has bad sleep apnea, excessive alcohol and fast food consumption. Bad general health that he isn't looking into effecting his sleep waking up 6+ times a night, not being mindful of his noise, slamming doors, lod at weird times as well as 3 dogs that aren't getting the attention and care that they need. Barking at weird hours of the night that's starting to effect my health and wellbeing. I'm not sure how to bring it up.

1klwd4g,I failed.,AriaXero,"I failed my son. Not for lack of effort, desire, or care, but because I ran out of available options and didn’t know where to look for more.

Today, I got cc’d on the email he sent back to his high school vice principal, school counselor, and government teacher. It was well written and succinct. It was his confirmed decision to not attempt summer graduation since he does not qualify to graduate next week with his classmates and friends. He stated his decision to seek a GED instead.

Nothing in the email came as a shock to me. I’ve known for over a year that this was the most likely outcome. But still, a part of me feels like it has died. Right after that email was a senior class email about next week's senior activities and when and where to get their cap & gown and where to go for graduation rehearsal and graduation.

My son lost his love of learning years ago. It came in tandem with the loss of his love of reading. The boy who was reading college-level books in the 5^(th) grade now doesn’t read. The kid who is a social butterfly feels beaten down by the harsh words of classmates. He is angry and moody and feels ugly and worthless. And I keep circling back to the same thought: how did I fail him so badly?

I saw the pieces that kept falling: teachers who refused to allow him to enjoy a book just because and made him tear apart the meaning behind every word. Sometimes, (most times) an author just writes what they want to with no regard for what someone with an English degree thinks. He no longer reads books written by his favorite author, despite new books being written that he desperately wants to know the contents of.

Every time a teacher assigned work to be done independently. Every time he was expected to spend his entire evening doing an assignment instead of relaxing, and every time he was judged on his adherence to arbitrary rules instead of his actual knowledge, comprehension, engagement, and interests.

He spent years rehashing the same items in his classes, not because he didn’t understand, but because the curriculum is designed to play to the mid and low performers. So those who have high comprehension get bored and burnt out. Advanced placement classes are billed as “they get more work because they can handle it” not “here is the next progression from what you already know”.

I have respect for most teachers and school administrators. Yes, there are some who should never be allowed to teach, but those are the minority.  They are doing their best within the framework dictated by people who have no business creating educational policies.

The system is rotten. Down to the roots. The ability to follow the school structure has no bearing on a person’s ability to be a good person or succeed in life. But students are made to believe that they have no value if they don’t fit this architecture.

I failed to find a system that would allow my son to grow by supporting him in a way that best matched his learning style and enthusiasm. I failed to provide him with a sufficient amount of support to be able to brush off negative comments from peers as nonsense unworthy of notice. And I failed to provide an environment for him where he could feel 100% comfortable being his whole self.

 

Next month, once the worst of the failure pain is behind him, I will give him everything he needs to get his GED. Because, unfortunately, the world we live in is structured on the belief that you can’t do a job if you don’t have proof of academic completion, as opposed to proof that you have an aptitude for the actual work to be performed.

 

But I still failed him. I just hope one day he understands that I tried. Not because I had to, or because others were looking, and certainly not because I didn’t think he was good enough, but because by the time I figured out what I was doing wrong, it was too late. And because knowing what didn’t work does not inherently mean you know how to fix it or what is needed to make it better.

My son is capable of great things. And there is only a little bit of mom prerogative in that statement. He can do so many things that I not only cannot do, but I don’t have the capacity to understand.

One day, he will find his place. And when he does, it will be amazing. I just hope he will be able to forgive me for failing him.",1,13,1747167809.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klwd4g/i_failed/

1klv88n,Finally accepting that my family is too and moving on,quiet_one21,"Sorry if this is a lot.....

Over the weekend my daughter had a cheer competition in  Florida.  I paid for everything myself including the hotel for about $600, car rental for $300 plus gas (for a 17+ hr drive), food for myself and daughter and other things we bought along the way. My sister came along and I didn't require her to pay for anything except her personal spending because she keeps complaining about money. One of the days while we were down there we went to Walmart and she kept putting things in the cart that she wanted. We got to check out and she asked me to pay for everything and said she'll cash app me later. I didn't complain- the total for everything was $50- she didn't pay me for anything. The next day day was mother's day and while we were at breakfast she said to my daughter ""make sure you say happy mother's day to your grandmother because you know she does a lot for you""...then changed the subject. I simply said ""so I don't get a happy mother's Day from you?"" And she responded ""I think of it as just being for grandmothers"" then went on to say it to my other sister and cousin... obviously I was  upset but I didn't let it overtake the moments beyond that point. Later she convinced me to stay another night to let my daughter hang out with her friends and agreed to pay for half of the hotel and cash app me but also reminded me she doesn't have much money. I told her it was fine but don't let it be like the Walmart trip. She caught an attitude and said she wanted to leave that night anyway but it was up to me (who was the only driver because she doesn't like to drive on highways or long distance). As we left I said ""we'll be driving through the woods tonight because of the route then she completely started cursing me out in front of my daughter and said I was disrespectful for my mother's Day comment and the cash app comment and all this other stuff. Basically this has been the dynamic of our relationship with us being rocky and going back and forth. I remained calm while she was cursing at me but told her I was done with her after this trip. I know I'm not overreacting but it hurts to be put in a position where I have to cut her, my other sister and mom off for similar reasons.

1klr9sd,Ungrateful parents?,Fun_Reply689,"Hi guys! I really need your advice. I'm feeling so confused and unsure about how to see things right now.

I'm 27 years old and currently the breadwinner of our family. My father has been jobless since I started college. As for my mom, I asked her to stop working right after I graduated six years ago because she has asthma, and she was the one who supported me all throughout college.

Even though she helped me a lot, I still worked hard to secure scholarships and took on part-time jobs because the financial support we had wasn’t enough.

I was fortunate to land a scholarship from a big company, and they supported me with Php5,000 per month. On top of that, they also covered some basic university supplies every semester and even provided me with a laptop. I remember when I became a President’s Lister, I also received several cash grants.

When my mom found out about this, she decided to take out a car loan. So even months before my actual graduation, the allowance I was receiving was already going towards paying off that loan. In other words, I hadn’t even started working yet, but I already had a financial responsibility.

Fast forward to today — the loan is fully paid. I still live with my parents and my sister. I give Php6,000 monthly to my mom and dad, while my sister contributes Php4,000. I pay for my own groceries and cover the electricity, water, and internet bills. So basically, the Php10,000 they receive every month is purely their allowance — just for them.

If I request a specific dish, they ask me to pay for it. When I’m sick and ask them to buy me medicine, they charge me for it too. If I eat with them and want something even like ""soft drinks"", they ask me to cover the cost too. Every time I go out, they expect me to bring something home.

I also love treating them, especially during special occasions. I take them out to eat, and during their birthdays, I’ve given them generous gifts like a cellphone, a sala set, trip to Boracay, or even Php10,000 — depending on how much extra I had that month.

I remember when I bought an air conditioner for my room — they got mad and called me selfish, saying I only cared about my own comfort and not theirs. I was shocked. I’m working to support them, and yet even that became an issue.

When I bought a motorcycle, they questioned it too. They said I should’ve just given them the money instead.

Sometimes, I can’t help but feel envious of friends who aren’t expected to give anything back — or if they do, it’s only what they can afford. I’ve even tried to open up to my mom about this. I’d ask, “Why is it that other parents don’t require this much from their children?” hoping she’d understand where I’m coming from. But instead, she compares me to other children who supposedly spoil their parents.

She’d say things like, “Nene took her parents here and there — when will I ever experience that?”

‼️ I hope you read until the end, because this is where my question comes in:

Recently, my mom and I had an argument. It got heated, and she told me that I act like I’m throwing it in their faces that I’m the one supporting them. That was never my intention. I broke down and told her, “I’ve already given you everything.”

She responded with, “You may be giving us everything, but you’re treating us like your servants.”
She pointed out that they’re the ones doing the laundry, cooking, and even tidying up my clothes.

That shattered me. Aren’t those things done out of love too, because I’m their child? Because they care for me?

I’ve been carrying this heavy feeling ever since. I don’t even want to talk to them right now. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Everything I’ve held in just exploded all at once.",1,2,1747155802.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klr9sd/ungrateful_parents/

She then asked me to get character.ai on her phone. I also know what this is, but I didn't think much of it.

1klo4gm,Clever Tips to Pass Down Family Expertise,maureen1231,"[https://maureensantini.substack.com/p/clever-tips-to-pass-down-family-expertise](https://maureensantini.substack.com/p/clever-tips-to-pass-down-family-expertise)

Many parents presume that an informal chat with their kids is a good way to pass down their family’s history and values.

When I was young, my mom and I had several such conversations while sitting around watching old movies on TV. She had fond memories of growing up in an idyllic lumber community in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

Not surprisingly, because I was barely a teenager, I was unaware of the importance of these off-the-cuff chats. It never occurred to me to take notes or write it down. As I aged I forgot most of the details.

It wasn’t until some years afterward that I began serious family research. In the end, as a result of spending time with extended family in childhood, occasional conversations with my mom and dad, and genealogy research, I was pretty well grounded in my family roots and values, though we never talked about it in those terms.

My “education” occurred in stages, haphazardly, until I began serious genealogy research. There is still a lot that I do not know. Not many people have the time and energy to delve deeply on their own.

A few years ago, alarmed at the amount of information people were taking with them to their graves, I created [a simple way](https://maureensantini.substack.com/p/the-foolproof-way-to-write-your-life) for everyone to write their life stories for posterity, one decade at a time.

However, I recently ran across [an article](https://assistedlivinglocators.com/articles/generational-wisdom-seniors-passing-down-skills-and-traditions-to-younger-generations) outlining a systematic way to transfer knowledge from one generation to the next that nicely complements writing it all down.

This article, bylined by Sarah Hallmark-Brower, advocates taking inventory of the skills, knowledge, and strengths of family members and devising ways, such as storytelling evenings and skill-sharing workshops, to transfer the information to the family group.

A few of the suggestions:

**Monthly Workshops**

On a rotating schedule, each family member, regardless of age, leads a hands-on workshop to share their unique skills and traditions from woodworking to cultural practices to demonstrating how to make family recipes.

**Storytelling Evenings**

Storytelling evenings “provide a designated time for elders to share personal narratives, family anecdotes, and insights gained over a lifetime.”

**Skill-Sharing Circles**

During skill-sharing circles, family members take turns sharing their unique skills, fostering “a culture of continuous learning within the family” and ensuring “that a diverse range of talents is passed down through the generations.”

**Documenting Family Wisdom**

Families use this segment to preserve and pass down family knowledge and traditions via things like written records and videos. This ensures that essential skills, cultural insights, and cherished stories are not lost with time.

Through all of these methods and more, “Documenting family wisdom becomes a cherished endeavor, preserving our unique identity and cultural values.”

Nothing tops the permanence of the written word, if carefully preserved. But combining a written life story with an ongoing family process of passing down knowledge and skills is unbeatable.

i don’t think it’s possible to sum this up without core details to get the full picture, so if anyone needs more context let me know. 
This woman has been in my life since i was born, she was there for my birth, and since that day she’s engaged in extremely concerning behaviors. first of all i want to give some light context into her character before i get into this. she’s always been obsessed with men. she would skip family gatherings, she would start jobs in the same field as the man she wanted to pursue, she would obsess (and i mean OBSESS) over whatever niche or interests her boy toy of the month was into, she would dig through their trash, she would look through their windows, and so much more. but strangely, when the man she was harassing finally decided to give her a chance, all the sudden she wouldn’t want them anymore. so fast forward to my birth, once i was born she essentially used me to get into a man’s house so they could play pretend family in hopes of him letting her get in his pants. long story short, that didn’t work, and all of that attention for him suddenly shifted towards me. she would REFUSE to let me go home to my mother, she would tell strangers that my mother abandoned me/ was on drugs, and generally would manipulate toddler me with grand gestures and purchases to get me to trust her. fast forward to today, and a lot of family drama later, i’m now 18, and it’s just gotten worse to the point i feel violated. Here’s just a few highlights : [ she knows i don’t like to be touched so she’s attempted to pay me for hugs (i don’t accept), she constantly leaves bag fulls of random stuff on my porch knowing it makes me uncomfortable, she’s broken into my house i wanna say 8 times now to the point of having to get my locks changed, i’ve caught her looking through my door window, when i ignore her she will blow my phone up with paragraphs of empty apologies and offers of financial support + multiple phone calls; (she’s also shown up to my work), she will offer complete strangers to her that she knows i’m close with food/money/clothes in a way to get closer to them to get to me, and so much fucking more that i don’t have the energy to get into. every time ive confronted her she goes straight to gaslighting and manipulation (i’ll provide proof if needed). ] i’ve asked her every which way to stop. i’ve been nice, neutral, hostile, whatever you can think of i’ve done, but she cannot take no for an answer.. but what compelled me to post about this today, right now, even after going thru this same shit for years, are these pictures i received on my porch. as i mentioned previously, she likes to leave shit on my porch bc she thinks it’s cute. there was a bag left a few days ago, that i didn’t go through til today bc ive been disturbed by recent events (i can make a second part explaining more if needed). upon checking it i found an envelope with printed pictures of myself spanning across the last 5 years. except in almost every picture, my friends were cropped out and my face was ZOOMED IN on. i’m talking 3-5 people per picture just gone bc she has that large of a fixation on my face. and even on her phone, every group picture containing me, is zoomed in and cropped. i’ve refused her to take pictures since probably 2018 for that reason. i personally just think that’s disgusting and weird behavior. the last big thing ill mention here, is she bought a whole second CAR, just bc she was offended that she wasn’t gonna be the one to co-sign my loan. i can’t be any more literal. i had plans to get my loan within the next few days of my mom test driving the car, i told her about it, the bitch went and BOUGHT THE CAR THE SAME DAY, just bc her obsession with being NEEDED told her that obviously i can’t get the vehicle by myself, i NEED her, and i NEED to take it from her. i’m not taking that car, and it’s upset her soo badly but im just at the point of pure disgust for how far she’s willing to cross my boundaries, that i don’t even care if im missing out on a cheap, hell even FREE car. bc it’s all a disgusting mentally unstable ploy to make her feel like i need her, and like she’s my mother, and i genuinely don’t know what to do at this point. i feel sadness, anger, disgust, violation, and sm more. and everyone in my life feels either 2 ways about it. they think i should “manipulate her into getting free shit” or “you’re enabling her behavior, just ignore her”. and i don’t think these people understand ive tried fucking everything. i just feel so alone, and need to know im not crazy for feeling violated by her behavior, and feeling violated in regards to her inability to take NO as an answer. i’m sorry this is long, my dms are open if more proof is needed, ty for reading. [i also wanna say that im gonna copy and paste this to other subs, but by no means am i trolling or making this shit up ( i wish). i just need more eyes to see this, and im hoping someone understands where im coming from. i just feel so so alone and i dont know what to do with this ]",1,3,1747148266.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klo2r9/i_just_need_to_know_if_anyone_is_going_through/
1klnsx3,AITA for choosing myself,PitifulFan1807,"All my life, I was compared to my older sister. She was the beautiful one, I was the ugly one. She knew how to talk to people, I was the introvert. She was always favoured by everyone while I remained invisible. 

My family gave her the special treatment throughout my childhood. She was a special child and I was ordinary. She earned well at first and I was jobless and my entire family including my grandparents applauded her and I was told I needed to step up. When I was earning and she didn't have a job, I was told she needed special treatment because she needs the sympathy factor. 

She got special treatment again when she was getting married, because apparently she was leaving the house. Now that I am at that age where my parents are searching for a matrimonial match, I don't get the same treatment. Instead, I am told that my sister comes once in a while so she needs to get the special treatment. 

I fell in love and actually found someone who likes me for who I am. One day, I dreamt that he chose my sister and burst out crying in the middle of the night. It's only then I realised just how deep this issue actually is to me. 

My family doesn't approve of the guy I fell in love with. He is ready to leave everything behind to start a life with me. The decision is in my hands but if I decide to choose myself and my happiness... AITA for it? ",4,4,1747147578.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1klnsx3/aita_for_choosing_myself/

I’ve lived with her my whole life but it’s gotten to the point where it’s exhausting to be around her. It’s mainly at me because I’m her blood. If I go to sleep earlier than 9 she gets upset because I don’t spend time with her and if I get up later than 8am she gets so mad and she sometimes ignores me for days about it. I was sick and throwing up all night and she didn’t care but she heard me and when I got up in the morning all she was worried about was me not listening to her about taking my pill even though I had listened to my doctor prior to taking it. She always finds something to complain about and it gets super tiring. I know by the sounds of it she just doesn’t wanna be lonely but I promise you she is an evil women who refuses to see her wrong doings.

1kllaxn,Annoying elder sister,Potential-Mud7133,"My (20F) sister (30F) is submitting the manuscript for her PhD this week. It's 51 pages long and she wants me to read it and check for errors before she submits it.

I didn't want to read it initially, but I made up my mind to do it because it is an important milestone of her life and my support would mean something to her 

But she started pestering me. I'm in my final year of college too, May is the last month actually. After this I graduate. I'm busy with exams and presentations. And when I'm not doing that, I'm spending it with my friends whom I'll have to leave in quite literally 10 days. And when I'm not doing even that, I'm alone in my room, de-stressing and playing Minecraft. 

I picked it up and read some of it. But she keeps calling me and pestering me about it. This makes me procrastinate on it even more. For the record, i do not like her at all. She does not understand boundaries, is emotionally immature, and has been extremely abusive to me in the past, and all through my childhood. 

I get physically uncomfortable when she calls or texts me and gets emotional about things. Whenever she's crying about our family issues, or seeking comfort in me for her personal issues, i get so damn icked. And i get called the monster in my family for this. Everybody asks me to adjust, to not turn bitter. But I was the sweetest child once. The most sensitive, the most expressive, the one who always comforted everybody.

All I ever got was betrayal. I'm the youngest in my family and they all talked about me and agreed on things while individually making me believe that they were on my side. I don't like her at all.

And I've begged her to keep her boundaries but she just wouldn't listen. There's no middle ground with her.

She called me 5 times today within 4 hours. That's so annoying, like I will call her back when I can. But no, she just keeps calling and keeps calling. 

She's 30 years old.
She plagues over me like anything. 

Anyway, this turned into a rant.

1kljuhk,I've never felt so alone. My father stole my disabled 75 year old mothers savings and faked two suicide attempts to seek asylum in Greystone to avoid jail time. It's been a year and a half already and nobody will help us. I need recourses/advice desperately ♥️😢,SpaceOddityX,"I've never experienced such loneliness in my entire life. It's been a year and a half from hell, and I truly do feel cursed. My father was a very intelligent man making a six figure salary as an engineer. He had always had a job, whether he was laid off, or got a better position. I always thought my father was so well put together, meticulous and financially savvy. I was extremely wrong and now I sit here wondering ""where did all of the money go?"" My mom was a nurse, an amazing one. Extremely loved, and had the actual heart for being a nurse. Unfortunately in 2002 she fell on the ground of the hospital she was working for, (wet floor) and her career abruptly ended at only 42 years old. Back surgery, slipped disks, arm/shoulder surgery, numerous catscans, MRIS, two hip replacements, a gallbladder removal, kidney cancer (a few years back) and deals with ibs, ptsd, panic disorder and to be really honest, I can't remember a time my mom wasn't in pain after her fall. It truly did ruin her entire life, and then my dad started taking over financially. I was a minor, so I wasn't involved. I hadn't known about financial issues AT ALL, I was under the impression our home was paid off. I was also under the impression that my dad was paying his bills, the mortage, ect. He starts acting ODD around 2023. He's acting MANIC, depressed, agitated, lashing out in violence (he beat me up from the time I was 16 to around 25, my mom got hit too. ) and frankly it mortifies me but we didn't know where to go, or have funds to just LEAVE, plus my mom's always sick. Times are tough and in 2023 he got a great job but WALKED OFF! Lies to us for 4 months! Goes out every morning (now I wonder WHERE DID HE GO FOR ALL OF THOSE HOURS, EVERY DAY?!?) He was living a double life essentially! Pathological liar, and we just found out he forged a signature on a loan against our home. We have foreclosure threats, we can barely eat, and it's all because of this loan he illegally took out, and all of his crimes/stolen money he took from my mom and I. We found out he stopped paying their life insurance, we found out he stopped paying our AAA bill when our car tire exploded but they couldn't come out to help because we owed 750 dollars 
 Summer of 2024 he attempted suicide, which is a lie. We actually have recordings where he admits TO THIS!!!! ""I Would never kill myself! I knew exactly what I was doing! I didn't think they'd commit me! I did it! I'm a white collar criminal, you name it, I've done it."" Literal quote from his last phone call from GREYSTONE. So, this is my question, When someone does finally admit their crime and admit they are suicide attempt was all fake, what can you do?! We have called the police! We have told Greystone, and these places have PROTECTED AN ABUSER! WE CALLED 911 to have him arrested! Now he's telling everyone he's ""crazy"" so he can escape ANY responsibility! My moms health is concerning me, everyday I wake up I make sure she's breathing, and mentally okay. I can't focus on anything but our situation, I feel physically ill at only 34. My friends have all truly shown me how much I NEVER meant to them. It's extremely hard for people to understand your father being a monster, but he is. He now calls every single day to torment us. ""Did the water get turned off yet?"" Which actually just happened to us last week. I cried...I'm at my end, I'm so exhausted I can't think straight, I made a go fund me but it truly feels like I'm sailing along an empty sea. We have this beautiful home but so much work needs to be done, we can't sell because we wouldn't even make enough from owing so much...my mom's name MUST be taken off these bills. This is a crime, my mom gave no consent, she owns half, but we're getting treated like crap. Nobody calls us back from any organization we call. Lawyers aren't really helpful at all, just want a quick buck. I can't seem to find anyone that can see this for what it is, abuse. Financially, mentally, psychology, and psychically. I have photos of black eyes, cps was here for him as a teen, we have documented history of abuse, my mom can't walk due to tendons in her foot needing surgery. We're down to a number so small it's only 4 digits. We have no cell phone service because we cannot afford it. We can't afford ANYTHING anymore, my mom's front tooth just needed to be replaced, so now we really are terrified for our financial disaster. I truly thought my father loved me, be careful who you consider family. Any advice, resources would be amazing. I have a job but it's not nearly enough, we are drowning. I would be appreciative of any ideas, I live in nj. I have every phone call, confession, evidence. I just need people to listen to our story. (Which is so much sicker, and more complex than I can type or convey on here. ) I hope this finds the right people, thank you for reading. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers. I am extremely afraid and only worry for my momma. I truly want to believe in humanity again. What father calls their daughter 71 times on her birthday to say ""having a fun birthday? Are you able to pay the electricity? Huh? No? Aww, that's too bad."" Sickening. I begged Greystone to make him stop because HE STILL CAN ABUSE US FROM HIS PSYCH HOSPITAL, and they won't! I NEED HELP.

1klecze,"🚽 Uh Oh, Number Two (or Not!): A BCBA's Hugely Relatable Guide to the Potty-Training Puzzler",jaynintyone,"""If I had a dollar for every time a parent told me ‘I’ve tried everything… pull-ups, rewards, charts — my kid still isn’t potty trained,’ I’d own stock in Pampers."" 😂 Seriously though, if you're in the trenches of potty training and feel like you've tried it all (including maybe a little bribery with their favorite snacks?), you're in the right place!

Hi r/family! I'm a BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) who works with kids and families, and I wanted to drop in with some no-judgment, practical advice for anyone navigating the sometimes-smelly world of potty training struggles. Let's be real – it can feel like your child will be rocking a pull-up at their high school graduation some days. But take heart!

**💬 First: You're Not a Potty-Training Failure (Promise!)**

Potty training success isn’t just about hitting a certain age. It’s a whole developmental cocktail involving:

* 🧠 **Body awareness:** Knowing when their little body is saying, ""Uh oh, something's brewing!""
* 🗣️ **Language comprehension:** Understanding what ""pee-pee"" and ""poo-poo"" mean and where they're *supposed* to go.
* 🧘 **Emotional readiness:** Feeling secure and not pressured by the whole process. Tears are like kryptonite to potty progress.
* 💪 **Motor skills:** Having the coordination to pull down pants (a surprisingly complex feat for tiny humans!).
* 🗓️ **Stability in routines:** Thriving on a predictable schedule that helps their bodies get into the potty groove.

**If even one of those pieces is still in progress, training can stall. And guess what? That's NOT on you!** You're raising a unique human on their own timeline.

**❌ What Not to Do (Steer Clear!):**

* 😠 **Don’t punish accidents:** Shame and anxiety are the enemies of potty progress.
* 🙄 **Don’t compare to other kids:** Every child is on their own potty journey. Seriously, comparing is the thief of joy (and dry pants!).
* 😱 **Don’t panic:** Late potty training does NOT equal bad parenting. It just equals a kiddo who needs a bit more time.

**✅ What To Do Instead (Your Potty-Training Toolkit!):**

1. 🕵️ **Watch for Readiness Signs:** Are they staying dry for longer? Hiding to poop? Showing genuine curiosity about the potty? Trying to undress themselves? These are your green lights!
2. ⏰ **Create Predictable Routines:** Regular potty trips (after waking, before bed, after meals – that digestive system is your friend!). Remember, just *sitting* on the potty is a win, even if it's just for a minute and nothing happens.
3. 🎨 **Use Visuals:** Potty charts with stickers are toddler gold! Timers can make it feel less like nagging. Potty-themed books can make it a familiar and less scary place.
4. 🎉 **Praise the Try, Not Just the Outcome:** Did they tell you they needed to go (even if they didn't quite make it)? HUGE win! Did they sit on the potty for ten whole seconds? Celebrate that micro-step! It's all about building positive associations.
5. 🧘 **Handle Accidents Calmly:** ""Oops! It happens. Let's clean up together and try again later."" Keep it neutral and matter-of-fact. No lectures needed!

**🆘 When to Ask for Help (It's a Sign of Strength!):**

Consider reaching out to your pediatrician or a specialist if:

* Potty-related fears turn into full-blown meltdowns.
* You suspect constipation is related to withholding.
* There are absolutely no signs of readiness by age 5.
* Your child has language or sensory processing challenges that might be making it harder.

A pediatrician, BCBA, or Occupational Therapist can offer tailored support and strategies.

**🧻 Final Thought:**

Potty training isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon (sometimes a very messy one!). So, if you're currently sitting on the bathroom floor questioning all your life choices because they just peed *next* to the potty (again!), please know you are absolutely not alone. And you are doing a fantastic job, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Seriously. ❤️

1kle4jk,Need advice on believable excuses to see my boyfriend while living with strict parents,OwlBackground1496,"Hi all,

I’m a 21-year-old woman about to graduate college, and I’m dreading what comes next: moving back in with my super strict, overbearing parents for the next year. For context, they’re traditional Muslim brown parents with very rigid rules, especially when it comes to dating. Dating is completely off-limits in their eyes, and if I were to date, the guy would have to be Muslim and brown. My boyfriend is neither.

Throughout high school, this wasn’t really an issue since I wasn’t dating or pushing boundaries, so we coexisted fine. But over the last four years of college (out of state), I’ve really grown into myself. I’ve dated, made my own decisions, and discovered how much I disagree with my parents’ parenting style.

The school year has always been a relief. I can live freely, see my boyfriend on weekends, even sleep over at his place regularly. But every summer when I return home, it’s a complete 180. I have to follow their rules: no going out more than once/twice a week, 9 PM curfew, no drinking/smoking, no shorts or skirts even in hot weather. Some of these I can tolerate (especially given their own cultures and upbringing), but others just feel suffocating and infantilizing, considering I’m a full grown adult who can make my own decisions.

Now that I’m graduating, I’ll be living at home full-time, and I’m already panicking. My boyfriend lives nearby, and I really want to keep seeing him on weekends like we have been. But there’s no way they’d allow me to sleep over at anyone’s place, let alone a guy’s, and definitely not someone outside their expectations.

I know the obvious solution is to move out, but that’s not financially realistic for me right now. So I’m asking: What are some believable, low-maintenance lies or excuses I can use to spend weekends with my boyfriend without raising suspicion? Preferably, is there some long term lie/excuse I could use?

Please don’t tell me to “just be honest.” I’ve tried that in the past, and they simply won’t listen or respect it. I’m looking for practical, realistic ideas that will help me survive this year without completely giving up the life I’ve built for myself.

Thanks in advance.

TLDR: Strict Muslim brown parents don’t allow dating, especially not with someone outside our culture/religion. I’ve been seeing my non-Muslim boyfriend during college, but I’m about to move back home full-time after graduating. Can’t afford to move out yet, but want to keep seeing my boyfriend on weekends. Looking for believable excuses or lies to get out of the house and avoid suspicion.

My sister and I began to have a bad relationship when was 18 and I was 20. I sent her a nasty text, which she misunderstood and took it as an attack, and we went no contact for almost two years.

We are both somewhat hardheaded and do not get along. A few months ago, we had a conversation and I was hoping it would go in the right direction. I have texted her, and she won't even reciprocate with a ""what about you?"" and it gets really frustrating.

I do not want to get into big details, but she's at the point where she does not want to work on things. I want us to be close, but she does not want any part in that right now.

1klb0zh,Step mom from Hell!!! Just want people's opinions on the situation.,Murky_Ad3600,"Disclaimer: All people within the story are of legal adult age. My sister was 18 and just graduated at the time. I was 20 and just graduated after being my mother's nurse for 15 years. My brother was 31, helping to fix the house and help pay bills. My father was years 56-year-old at the time, and Jane Doe was 54. My mom had a myriad of health issues before passing. She had stage 5 kidney failure and was on home dialysis, and required me to help her set up her machine at night. As well as assist with med distribution. My father helped with none of that while she was alive. My Sister was just freshly out of high school and just trying to start her life. My brother was recovering from a mental breakdown that almost cost him everything before moving back in with us. My Father was just a dick. 

Backstory: It begins like this;

Our mom passed away on December 18th, 2018, after a long life of health problems. So we all knew Christmas this year was gonna be a shit show. Fast forward to the second week of January, and our family is trying to put together my mom's memorial service. We get most of the details worked out and go about life as one does after the loss of a loved one. As the weeks flow together, we notice that our father is kind of down in the dumps, worse than we had seen before.  This kind of sadness continues for another couple of weeks. February rolls around at this point, we can all collect ourselves enough to start planning the memorial services. We get the details of those set in stone, we decide to have a local memorial for our mom shortly after for our church family and friends. 

A few days, maybe a week or two after the local memorial service, our dad has to go to the bank to settle some accounts and whatnot. My siblings and I, still reeling from the tragedy that took us all by surprise, are at the house when my dad comes home from the bank, happier than we had seen him in weeks. We were almost worried he had a psychotic break at the bank. Now we weren't rich by any means, gracefully low-middle class. So for him to be that happy after such a tragedy, plus to have just gotten back from the bank, was strange. As the little sleuths, my siblings and I began to ask him if everything was okay. He tells us that he made a ""friend"" at the bank that day. He tells us that she is a very nice lady and has also just recently lost her husband. So, as his kids, we were like, well, thank god or whatever higher power was at work that day. Because he has a friend to talk to about grief, and he won't be so hard to manage. Which seems harsh, but it was a rough couple of weeks after Mom had passed. So my siblings and I are happy for him at this point that he has a local friend to talk to. Little did we know that was the worst decision we made. He began to talk to her more and hang out with her like maybe one or two times, for coffee or food. We got through the family memorial we had that March. About a week later, my father says he would like us to meet this new ""friend"". So like the gracious kids we are, we agree cause he still seems happy even though our household was in disarray and our financials were a mess. As his kids, we persevered and agreed to meet with her. For the sake of privacy, we will call her Jane Doe. At this lunch, we all seem to get along, my siblings and I are a little confused by why we are meeting this ""friend,"" Jane Doe. But we are fine with it, about a day or two after meeting her, we realize that they are extremely close to each other, after just a month, after each of their loved ones had passed.

So we go about life as usual and are asked by our father if we can be nice to Mrs. Jane Doe, so she knows that we like her. Well, we think nothing of it at the time and go about life doing our normal things. Till my father had her stay over for the first time, and well, this Jane doe was like a rat you can't get rid of. So she begins to stay with us, aka just move right in. Jane Doe then begins to try and insert herself into mine and my sister's conversations regularly. Even starts to give my brother the creeps. We went on a trip to visit family, and my dad invited her so she could meet my mom's parents. During which she made the entirety of my family uncomfortable with the massive amounts of physical displays of affection. She then tries to befriend my grandparents, who have just lost their oldest daughter. After the trip, she began to buy us, or so it seemed. Instead of getting to know us. She would just buy us random crap we didn't ask for or want. Before my sister and I (mostly my sister) sit her down and are like, hey, we don't need all this stuff, we need other things like our light bill paid or our water bill paid. We don't need any more useless stuff. Again, we are still being nice at that point. My father then pulls me aside and says I need to start being more appreciative and kinder to her.  So my sister, who was genuinely being nice to Jane Doe, tries to explain that I am still processing our mom's death and that it's a little hard on me. So Jane Doe takes this and thinks she needs to start doing more. Well like I said I'm an asshole. So she continues this behavior of inserting herself in conversations and trying to act like she were a 20-something as a 60-year-old. So I fully admit I used her for the free stuff, because she seemed to be the only one who could get our father to pay the bills somewhat on time. So I begin to play like I'm her friend.

One time, my dad and Jane Doe went and picked my sister up from work….. Jane Doe sees a wild animal on her Ring doorbell and decides that my father needs to speed home so she can save her cats. They end up getting pulled over, and Jane Doe gets out of the car and is screaming and walking towards the officers. After not arresting Jane Doe, they agreed to let them go with a warning, leaving my sister traumatized and bewildered. So a little while goes by, it is as far from normal as one can be, but hey. So after a few weeks, my dad decides to rewrite his will, and it now includes his new friend and her children to get all of his possessions instead of his children. Meanwhile, my siblings and I are just trying to work to keep the lights on while my dad and Jane Doe are gallivanting around West Virginia and Tennessee every weekend. The bills start to pile up, my siblings and I are like What do we do. So we sit down with our dad, and he decides that it's just too much money for him to be going to her house, and that she should just move in. So she moves in, and it only gets worse from there. 

Again, it starts awkward and weird, but we are adults, and it's whatever ever at least the bills are getting paid. My sister starts working a different shift that gets her more money, and my brother is picking up more shifts for the same thing. Well, a few weeks go by, and sharing a room with my sister with different shifts wasn't the best idea. Considering I worked days as a nanny and she worked nights. An My father had moved into Jane doe’s house at that point. Well about a month or two goes by and my father and Jane Doe decided to move back in so they could use her trailer as a “Weekend house”. So I moved out of their old room to the couch in the living room. Well Mrs. Jane Doe then decides to trape across the house like goddamn elephant at 4 am waking the dogs, my siblings and I.  By turning on every light in the dang house. So from there it just seemed to get worse. She then started to complain that we were using their bathroom too much, granted, it was the only working bathroom in the house at that time. Then from there it became well that this was her house too, just continuous whining to my father. So one night, while my father and Jane Doe were staying at her house. My brother decided to talk with me just to say hey, you gotta try and be nicer to her and be more ""respectful"" of them, keeping the peace. So we do it for about a month or two. As the holidays approach, granted it's our first holiday season without our mother. My father says he is having Jane Doe join us, and she wants to help. My siblings and I are trying to be supportive, as this is our first holiday season without our mom, to which our father is oblivious. He even brings her with us to the grave site. Where She just acts like a fool and speaks on things she should not. So, talk about an awkward Christmas.  

We somehow dredged our way through the holidays, making it through December. When jane doe decides that it's okay to start changing things around the house. She makes the decision to remove everyone of the pictures of our mom and put up pics of her instead. Including the most awkward ""family"" photo ever, my brother wasn't even there and my sister had been cropped out. During this time, my sister and brother are telling me to be nice, be nice, blah blah. So I begin to be ""Nice."" I Begin to hang out with her again and she is none the wiser that all of the compliments, are more sarcastic than Bill Hicks on a good day. She then finds  out from my dad that my mom had a bunch of health issues. So she takes it upon herself to bring all of her health “problems” to me, like I'm some on-call nurse. She then uses that as a gateway to try and be like my mother in the most Coraline way possible. 

 Being that I'm trying to be nice, I tell her all the problems are fine and if she is worried go to a professional. Even though I'm not a licensed professional. Well, fast forward to the next few days, she takes my sister and I on a forced bonding trip. Jane Doe tells us that she is not trying to replace our mom and that we don't have to call her mom. To which I unthinkingly told her we never thought she was and that unfortunately that's shoes she could never fill. Well, that seemed to send things into a real bad spiral. She tells my father about it and that my sister was some mastermind of evil, and that our sister convinced me and my brother to treat her poorly. When my sister defends herself, she says “You think that I would come up with that.” she just tried to reassure her that she is being nice and she is trying to stop me from being a dick.  My brother and I both come to her defense and I even after I told her that if I'm going out of my way to be ""nice,"" chances are I'm not being nice. So, for some reason, this changes the narrative to now my sister is being rude and that she didn't want Jane Doe in the house, and she was the reason we were broke all the time. (Not the trips every weekend out of state during Covid had anything to do with it or the fact that my literal teenage sister was genuinely being nicer than I ever was..) But anyway, I kept being a dick despite my sisters and brothers best efforts.

After that whole conversation with Jane Doe, I decided my mother's pictures needed to come back out.  I also needed to up my game if she wasn't going to get a clue. So I started to make my comments a little more brutal. My brother got the other bathroom working again, so we weren't in their ""space"" anymore. Which also meant that our laundry room was working again. Which after a period of not having a washer laundry does pile up. Jane Doe took that as a personal attack. So she once again complained/whined and I kid you not literally cried. To my father full temper tantrum style. That we were trying to keep her from doing their laundry to make her look bad. As well as a way to push her away and not “make room” for her in our lives.   So we came up with a laundry schedule that she never could figure out so it was always an issue. I mean, it wasn't our fault she was incapable of human comprehension, right? 

I digress that we were trying our best to get along. Well, by this point, my brother was working so much that his mental health was deteriorating. My sister was too stressed with school and work. On top of being worried about what Jane Doe would say next to try and get her kicked out. So I’ll admit that I used Jane Doe’s deep pockets to fuel my Bad habits. Meanwhile, nobody is worrying about the bills. Once again, as it always does, bills became due, and my dad would take it personally and lash out by screaming/ slamming all the things he could. While putting the blame on my sister and I. cause we haven't been helping enough or making Jane feel welcomed. So he just all together stops paying altogether and just does what he wants with Jane Doe and leaves us to our own devices. They for all sense of the meaning, moved out and I can't stress that enough. We think this is the best thing to have happened in years. Well, we get the bills straightened out and we get all the stuff almost to a good level, I mean no money for groceries, but hey, rice and chicken broth never gets old. My siblings and I handle all the bills as best we can and try to keep food on the table while taking care of my dads dog that my dad had just left behind. 

My sister finally got to go to school. Things were looking up. Well, all good things must come to an end, right? Once again, Jane Doe and our dad move back in and make her house their ""weekend house"". Well of course shit hits the fan once again and my siblings and I are left with a deadline of we have to be moved out by September that year. So we start to freak out wondering; What are we going to do? So we all go about our lives figuring it out. All the while trying to dodge my father and Jane Doe within the house. We get ourselves together and Jane Doe just still isn't satisfied for some unknown reason and decides to try and be mine and my sister's “friend” again while treating us like crap. We have to be ""nice"" and during this time Jane Doe decides to lose all sense of the meaning of boundaries and decides to walk into mine and my sisters room repeatedly unclothed throughout the months of us getting our stuff together to move out. She would also walk around complaining that ""her"" house is a mess. All of us were still trying to keep the lights on in the house and keep what little peace we all had left.  Like clockwork work Jane doe starts up again, and brings my father into it more now. It also mostly seemed geared toward my sister for some unknown reason now. Jane Doe tries to be our ""Friend"" again. Shortly after with the  same stuff different label all over again. We all get out of the twilight zone and begin furthering our lives. Until about a two years later our  father  tried to contact us and be all buddy buddy again. Asking why we don't ever answer Jane Doe or why we never contact them. There are more stories than the ones I highlighted here; these were just the basic rundown of what happened.

1kl8bi3,Why don’t my parents talk around me?,meowy_face,"I have a complicated relationship with my family and especially my parents, but they do something that really bothers me. For context I (25f) live in a tiny house on their property. I lived independently between 18 and 23 when I moved back home to continue my education. I keep fairly busy but every couple days I will make sure to be around them and converse a little because if I don’t my mother starts to ask if I’m okay or if she’s upset me and things of that nature. I will try to be around them when it makes sense to, so with the nicer weather we’ve been having I will come to sit in the garage with them for a while. They leave the garage doors open so I can here them conversing, laughing, having a normal time, but as soon as they know I am within earshot like when I open the gate or when I come into the garage the conversation ends. They hardly talk to me and they don’t even talk to each other and just let me be there. I totally understand that sometimes they have conversations that they don’t want me to hear, but for the conversation to come to a complete stop literally every single time just doesn’t make a lot of sense and it honestly hurts my feelings. I often feel they don’t want my presence, but then if I choose not to come around for more than three or four days they question me. I feel like I have to sit in this awkward silence when there was clearly a lively conversation sometimes less than a minute prior. I guess I just wish I understood better so I could cope with this easier.

1kl7nwd,Is my parents in the right?,Electronic_Author808,So about a month now I started a job at a hospital as a Lab Assistant(Phlebotomist) with a great pay rate but only per diem hours. Ive only been getting around minimum 20-25hrs a week so far. My parents really don’t think I should be working this schedule and instead find another job that is full time but the thing is I am in SF and finding a full time position in my work is basically impossible so they think I should just work in another field and take the great pay loss. Personally I think I should stay in this position bc of how much i get paid which is 37$ an hr until offered more weekly hours or a full time position. My parents don’t believe i get paid this much and are threatening to kick me out and since I just started my career I cant afford to live on my own and dont have anyone to help me if I were to be kicked out. They think everything is like the 80s or 90s where finding a job is easy and they think it’s better to apply in person.

1kl4vzp,Mom's phone calls begin like a circus,Proper-Application69,"Speaking on the phone with my mom keeps getting worse. The calls always start with a circus at her end, even when ***she*** calls ***me***.

Edit: it’s frustrating when it happens, but I’m sharing this because when I think about it, it’s hysterical.

**EDIT: I think it's funny. I'm not perpetually upset or frustrated about it. It just is. And I do love her so I put up with the insanity in the moment and laugh about it later.**

When she calls, by the time I touch ""Answer"" and put the phone to my ear she's shouting ""Are you there!? Helloooooo! Can you hear me!?"" When she finally hears my voice, she's annoyed that I took so long to say anything. ""Oh, there you are. Didn't you hear me? You picked up and didn't say hello. What took so long?""

Then one of the following occurs:

**1)** She drops the phone. As soon as it hits the floor she starts yelling ""Hold on! I dropped the phone! Hold on! Wait I'll be right there! Hang on! I've almost got it! If you can hear me don't hang up! I'm coming! Here I come! Don't hang up!""

**2)** The TV is on blaringly loud coming through the phone.  ""Hi Elmer. What? Hang on, I can't hear you over this crazy TV."" With her TV blaring on my phone, she continues ""Hold on! I can't find the remote! Where is that remote!? I just had it here. It was right here. Hang on, I think I know where it is. Let me just... Are you still there? Hang on! I can't hear you - can you hear me?- hang on!""

**3)** She needs her full attention to do something else and makes me wait. ""Hi. I'm calling because - oh - wait - I have to do something really quick. Let me just see if I can... I need to put the phone down for a minute. Can you hold on?""

I reply ""You just called me! Can you just call me back when you're done?""

""I'm ready to talk right now, Elmer. I just have to do this one thing. It will just take a minute. Hold on, okay?""

**4)** The moment we finish greeting each other, she takes a big bite of something and makes a little noise that means ""Hang on, I have something important to say, but my mouth is full at the moment"". As if it was bad timing. She wasn't expecting that bite.

\_\_\_\_

This is the one that put me over the edge. The absolute epitome of answering my mom's call.

She calls. ""Hi Elmer.""

I hear the beeping from the house alarm. It's coming across the phone very loud. Mom and Dad just returned home and mom entered the house, and the alarm beeps are reminding her to disarm it. She didn't disarm it before calling. She says ""I just wanted to check if you received the blah blah blah blah.""

I cant hear her over the beeping. ""Just ignore the beeping,"" she says. Did you receive the blah blah blah blah?""

""Mom, I can't hear you. Why don't you take care of the alarm and call me back?""

""It's okay, just ignore it. I have to WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO!"" The alarm has gone off.

It is SOOOO FREAKING LOUD over the phone - I scrambled for the volume buttons. Mom continues, ""Elmer!!? Can you hear me!!? I can't hear you!! This crazy alarm is going off!!!! WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! Hang on!! Don't hang up!!! Okay!? I'll be right back!""

Then she starts alternately yelling to my dad and telling me to hold on. ""Wilbur!! I can't get the alarm off!! Wilbur!!! Yes!!! I did that!!! Hang on Elmer!! Hold on, okay!!!??? WEEEEOOOOO!  WEEEEOOOOO!  WEEEEOOOOO!  I can't hear you! Hang on - I want to talk to you!!  I don't know! - I did that!! You do it!!! Can you just do it!!!!? Hang on!! Elmer, can you hear me? WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO! WEEEEOOOOO!""

It would have been hysterical if I was watching this in a movie. It's pretty frustrating while it's happening.

1kl4siz,My mom suspects I'm gay or Bi,ChiQQuiLiNN,"I'm 19, and for about 2 months my sister and mom always brought up my male friend, and whenever he was brought up, they'd always say, "" Bring you bf over"", ""Why? do you want to see your bf?"", and I don't take offense when someone calls me gay, even when they might be serious but it's never botherd me. Recently, my sister asked me out of nowhere, if I'm gay, or even bisexual, I asked why, and she said because my friend would always touch me whenever he was around, and I mean I do that with all my friends, but to be honest this friend seemed a little gayer than the others, and this stood out to her, I guess. The only thing that bothered me was that my mom literally thinks I'm either gay or Bi; she hasn't even asked me, and by this point, she knows I've had girlfriends, but I haven't brought up anything about talking to a girl recently. It's not the idea that my mom thinks I'm gay or bi that bothers me, but it's the fact that she's been telling my whole family what she's suspecting, which is kinda messing with my head. I'm not sure if I should confront her and ask her, but she told my sister, not me, and my sister also told me not to say anything because my mom doesn't want me to know. But there's a point where I should surely ask her, because she can't be telling all her friends and family her thoughts, and claiming them to be facts. Now that I know my mom has been telling others, even now, I'm starting to question whether or not I might be what she claims, and I'm not sure if my mom has influenced my recent thoughts. What should I do? I'm not sure. If I say something, my mom will know my sister ratted her out, and my mom will always hold that grudge, then my sister will probably not tell me any more rumors that my mom might be saying. Am I bi or gay? I've only started to question myself now, and I thank my mom for that. If I had to choose one, I think Bisexual, I don't know what to do.

1kl262d,That one feeling you have for your dad,Several_Stock1001,"hey, im paul. im 15, i have a father that really loves me and i really love him also but i wish i knew how to make it seem genuine (if that even makes sense)

So, my mom and dad basically got into a conflict where my mom saw dad having an affair with someone for 5 years. Obviously, my mom was very furious about this but she took her remained calmed and confronted my dad. I couldn't really remember what my dad was saying but I still remember his tears hitting the concrete floors. Listening to them argue was alone shattering, let alone them talk about me.

few years later, my mom somehow worked things out with dad and they were on good terms. but dad left our country after they were arguing so we were the one to adjust for him. we flew to him every occasion but i would always get tired and sick of it. but now, seeing my dad putting effort to coming to us is actually heart breaking. idk why, but its just something to do with him overcoming his fear of getting judged by my mothers family side.

Now that we try to hangout, it always doesnt feel the same and its awkward for me. He tends to give me money alot but it still wont change how i feel about him. Fast forward a year later, i still havent forgave him and he always took flights to see us. But this one night in particular, is different. I usually dont really care if he goes back to where he came from, but this night left me completely bawling my eyes out. He woke me up at 3am and he said that he was going back to his place. and the worst part was, the night before this all happened, i planned to go and sleep with him because i had a gut feeling that he would be leaving soon. and also the fact that he lives alone and also sleeps alone every night.

Dad, Im so sorry for being such a douchebag to you. I should've forgave  you. I know you changed and I didn't even see that. I love you dad.

1kl24hj,Going crazy about living situation with brother in law. Advice needed.,aninterestingcomment,"Small context, I've(F,28) moved recently to the US in late November 2023 to be with my husband(M,33). I lived in Malaysia by myself before this. I haven't stayed with family since I graduated high school, they were pretty toxic and abusive so I keep a distance which also means I might not be used to a different kind of family dynamic. My husband has lived in the US all his life. At \~23, he started paying mortgage on a house. This is the house we're (me, husband, brother in law) currently living in. His other family members would live here on and off (brothers, in laws, and mother) but it's still my husband's house despite sometimes it feels like our house is open to them 24/7 (another story for another day)

We're living with my husband's older brother (43) and he should be moving out by the end of the month. However, he has some habits that make me uncomfortable and I'm no longer sure what the right course of action is anymore. He walks around in his underwear, doesn't clean up after himself nor does his chores. He used to sleep on the couch despite having agreed to only sleep in his room once I moved in. He's stopped now, but we still catch it sometimes and my husband will tell him to go sleep upstairs. I'm the one who cleans after him most of the time. My husband helps out, but it's still 80% cleaned by me.

Honestly, I've been crashing in and out about this mentally (being a newly legal immigrant in 2025 in a red state + all this at home + previous trauma) but I'm holding onto the hope that he's moving out by the start of next month. I can't legally find a job, nor can I drive so I'm stuck at home 24/7 with my cats and while a part of me wants to show him his actions has consequences, I need to make sure the floor is clean and like in case the cats are out and about they won't accidentally eat something or topple anything.

We've asked him to help out with chores, I asked him to please put on some clothes when I'm around (I was raised Muslim in Malaysia, men who aren't family don't walk around topless in front of a woman) and to also ensure his stuff for his aquarium isn't accessible to the cats but he just DOESN'T CARE. The smallest thing of please making sure his bedroom door and the toilet door upstairs is closed (we don't use our upstairs rooms for anything, but cats will be cats yknow?) and he still can't do it. He told us he forgets sometimes, so I started placing post-it notes on his door but he still somehow forgot 3 times in the span of 10 days. My cats like playing fetch and they've been fetching his algae and some other things for his aquarium and despite telling him to put it somewhere else, he doesn't so my husband and I clean his mess. He has also once flooded our closet and kitchen floor after falling asleep filling up his water tank for his aquarium, and we had to clean up most of the mess. He half-assed it and didn't even say sorry.

He used to pay rent, stopped for almost a year until I told my husband that isn't fair and he should be paying for something. Now he pays rent at a discount and my husband was kind enough (imo a bit too kind) to absolve some of his loans too.

My husband and him(BIL) had a sit down talk where he was told to help with the chores and that he needs to start paying rent. In that conversation BIL agreed to pay for rent, stop sleeping in the living room and move out eventually. He did say that since I'm unemployed I should be cleaning the house and that he sees my husband cleaning up and cooking. When my husband cleans and cooks, 90% it's just helping me out. Especially cooking cause he thinks only a wife should cook apparently. Like my husband and I's cooking process goes I sous-chef, he cooks it, sometimes. I still cook for my husband and my husband helps out cleaning the dishes or with prep. We both have zero complains about our mechanic. Before I came my husband already said he doesn't want me to think I have to cook and clean for him, he just wants me to feel safe and relaxed while going through immigrating and making a new life in the US. I do all this because I love my husband and like it feels kinda nice to RP as a housewife for now but like I'm doing it for my husband and not for his family.

He then continued to say that my husband spoils me too much and my husband said that she spoils me so I give back so that was that. Now however, I think he's taking a piss at me tbh. His habits hasn't changed, he still walks around in his undies, I still clean his mess up, and we still need to remind him constantly to do chores.

Is this normal in other Asian households or is this some bullshit? How do we fix this? Cause I'm ngl, I'm very angry at this situation and I don't want to erupt but my patience is running thin.

We've tried talking to him multiple times, we tried cleaning up and being patient and we've tried post-it notes. I feel like it's inappropriate for me to call him out cause I'm his brother's wife and my husband has tried to put his foot down by telling him to move out but it's still a little intimidating for him cause he's his older brother and in Asian families, it's out of the norm to talk back to your elders.

I would love advice! I am also okay with talking to him and confronting him instead of my husband cause at this point I hate him :) He is really taking advantage of my husband's kindness and I hate feeling like a maid in my own house and not feeling comfortable because there is a man in his underwear outside my door that I've only known for 6 months.

  
EDIT: 

TLDR  
Husband's (33M) older brother (43) who lives with us won't do chores, or anything much to help out with the house but still makes a mess. Tried talking to him and putting post-it notes to remind him but nothing works. He's moving out within a month but would like to see if there's any way to make his transition smoother (aka not me being his maid)",1,4,1747079476.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kl24hj/going_crazy_about_living_situation_with_brother/
1kl1vq4,"My daughter thinks I hate her, and it’s breaking me.",Old_Price8046,"

I (38M) am a proud father to my 12-year-old daughter. I love her with everything I’ve got—heart, soul, and every breath in between. Because of work, we’ve been living apart for a while—two different islands in the Caribbean. It’s not ideal, but it’s a good-paying job that lets me support my family, pay for her private school, her violin lessons, karate classes—all of it. We visit each other as often as we can.

The other night, my wife and I were talking about TikTok. One of our standing rules is that our daughter can’t have her own social media until she’s older, but she’s allowed to use her mom’s account to watch videos. My wife wanted to talk through why we’ve set that rule, and in the middle of the conversation she brought up something that completely blindsided me.

She told me—gently—that she’d accidentally come across what she realized was our daughter’s diary... and in it, our daughter wrote that she thinks I hate her.

I went completely silent.

My wife quickly tried to reassure me—saying she’s a teenager, full of emotions, and might not even remember writing that. But I didn’t hear much after that. It hit me like a truck. I’ve barely been able to think about anything else since.

I love that little girl so much. I’ve never missed a milestone, not if I can help it. If she needs me, I drop everything. I check in constantly. I talk to her about anything and everything. I always try to make sure she knows I’m there—even from afar.

So to read that she might feel the opposite... it hurts. Like a hot knife through the chest.

I know I might be reading too much into a private thought written without context, but man—it’s shaken me to my core. I don’t even feel like talking to her right now until I sort through the storm in my head. That sounds awful to admit, but it’s where I’m at.

I guess I’m just venting here. My brother recommended Reddit when I told him how I was feeling. Maybe some other parents have been through something like this? Am I overreacting? Is this just part of parenting a pre-teen in today’s world?

Because right now... I feel like I failed in some huge, quiet way. And she’ll never know how much her one line knocked the air out of me.

The 27 yr old is not doing well. He graduated high school in 2016 and since then has been sitting in his childhood room playing games and going to work. He’s a mechanic at a dealership but he makes no money especially since he blows it on fast food and computer parts.

I’m not shamming him, but atp it’s like he has nothing going for him, he’s not doing anything to improve himself.

1kkypfb,Some advice regarding family dynamic when dealing with a bad situation between extended families.,zethanox,"Hello, I'm not sure how to make posts properly here so bear with my. My (29m) aunt (67 f) and uncle (67 m) are in a very toxic situation that is bleeding into the rest of the family. 

They're together legally but have been seeing other people for a few years now. Think they stayed together for the kids but the kids are grown now.  Uncle is very clearly an undiagnosed/untreated manic depressive  narcissist. He is very smart and a doctor and is able to bs his way out of being diagnosed by acting normal. 

He almost NEVER attended family events. He was later (last 30 minutes) to his kids barmitsva, graduation, weddings, ect. He just roles on, eats (with his hands), and leaves. He thinks aliens rule the world and a mythological place is real but just floating in the atmosphere and being covered up by world governments. 

The problem is he won't let my aunt go. He has threatened to kill her if she tries to leave. He has been stealing money (10k a month) before it hit their shared account for like 30 years or more. He burns it all on pyramid schemes. 

He had his daughter buy a property for him to flip but now he is holding it hostage (which will financially ruin my cousin) in order to force my aunt to stay. And much more. 


The question we have is at what point do we forcibly intervene. Because he isn't physically capable of harming anyone (he is very frail) but he is mentally unstable enough to light the hpuse on fire or something. We can't force the aunt to leave or for him to seek help. We fear if we call the cops that they won't keep him and then he will take it out on the aunt if we interfere at all. 

Unfortunately I'm pretty out of the loops and don't know much details (just found out all of this recently. I just thought he was anti social) there is definitely more at play then I'm aware of. Also he is almost certainly laundering money through their shared account. Which she is worried will get her in trouble as well. 

Also his philosophy is that because he makes a lot of money he can waste all their money whenever he wants because he can just make it back (never does. They just struggle back to where they were before and then he does it again)

Also how should we intervene? Cops? Adult protective services? Forcibly admit him to mental counciling? ",1,1,1747071476.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kkypfb/some_advice_regarding_family_dynamic_when_dealing/

My in laws are pretty traditional in everything and obviously super religious. But they have been super loving and supportive since our second year of dating.

1kkwueb,Family members keep extremely messy home.,LekkerSnopje,"I'm curious what we can do to help - or keep space - from a very unclean home. 

My in laws have always been messy. I have always been a bit ocd about mess. You have to remember this going into the backstory. 

My spouse and I have helped my in laws clean various parts of their mildly hoarder house through the years. We've cleaned out the basement twice. We've cleaned out the garage twice. We do the yard work as much as possible and help organize when things get really bad. They were always grateful and it helped make our relationship stronger. 

Unfortunately, there have been some changes to the family where one of the siblings on my spouses side has moved in with my in laws. Totally needed - and it's wonderful the family can band together like this. To help, we moved tons of items into the basement and cleared the garage of all my sister in laws stuff - and cleaned out a packed, messy bedroom and made it into a nice cozy bedroom. 

But the house has gone from mild hoarder to pure chaos. Not a single room is clean ever. The room we organized and cleaned is so gross the sister in law doesn't even sleep in it anywhere. You can't sit anywhere. There are piles of things on every surface and chair. The yard we renovated a few years back is filled with dog feces that gets dragged into the house. The stuff is just packed like crazy. It smells like hot moldy cat piss and dog breath. Its always smelled but now it smells much, much worse. It's the worst house I've ever been in in my whole life up to this point. Just terrible. 

My spouse and I have spent hours processing how utterly terrible it is. There is a lot of emotional stuff going on - but we've already helped so many times and no one else seems to care. We'd love to keep helping my mother in law but it feels awkward to clean up my sister in law (and her kids) mess. My kid has stepped on plates of food under pillows in her cousins room. My own hand has to flick away a cat turd or something like it when I sat on the floor. 

My spouse agrees that it's ick and has talked to her mom about it. The mom agrees that it's ick but doesn't want to fight with her daughter about it. 

I am not sure I want to go there - or bring my kids - with the current state. I have to hang out outside so I can breathe most of the time. I want my spouse to say something to his sister - but he said the backlash would be too big and not worth it. 

Has anyone ever dealt with this level of family filth? Is it a habit? Why do they keep trashing their house? ",1,2,1747067127.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kkwueb/family_members_keep_extremely_messy_home/
1kkvmd7,"My twin boys are way too dependent on each other, how do I change that ?",Individual-Yam2995,"I’m the mother of 14 y.o identical twin boys who are extremely dependent on each other. They have rarely been separated, and every time it has happened, it ended badly. They now refuse to do anything unless they are together. They won’t make new friends and have no interest in spending time with anyone outside of each other. If I try to take just one of them to the grocery store, they both get upset and turn against me.

We have a complicated family background, and I understand their bond is strong, but this has gone beyond healthy, it’s extremely serious. I tried therapy but they both shut down completely and refuse to speak. They are convinced there’s nothing wrong and refuse to engage because they don’t want to be seen as “weird.” If one of them is alone, he won’t even talk to me. They view the outside world, including me, as a threat trying to separate them.

I’m really struggling with how to support them and encourage independence without losing their trust completely. I know they’re happy together, that part is clear. They’re constantly talking and laughing with each other. They don’t even like video games, they prefer being outside playing soccer or in the garden, always chatting nonstop.
But the contrast is brutal when they’re around anyone else. They completely shut down, not a word, not even to me if they’re separated. It’s like the rest of the world doesn’t exist to them. I don’t want to force them apart or label their bond as a problem, but I’m deeply worried about their social development and longterm well being.

Hours past by,I was still crying, because it was very painful even though I already put my whole hand in a bucket of cold water with ice on it. This was not the only time he did something like this, he did a lot of things that physically hurts me. There was one time that I almost got killed. I did nothing nothing to him for what he had done to me, instead I ignored him. I will never be like him— stupid.

I had enough of his nonsense and he exhausted the patience out of me that I had since he was born. I always adjust and tried to understand my younger brother. Always give way to everything, because he was ""YOUNGER"". He's fucking dumb and I will not consider him as my brother ever again.Funny fun fact about him, he still sucked his thumb to sleep. I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HIM UNTIL I DIE.

1kkuebv,My mom is desperate for my son’s affection. Help!,Boring-War-5106,"I'm new to Reddit so forgive me if I'm not doing this right. 
I want to start off by saying that I love my mom and that I know she doesn't do any of this maliciously. My son is 3 years old and has started getting very upset when my mom comes over. At first I thought he was just tired because my parents usually come over after nap but now it's become clear that it's just when he sees my mom. The first thing she wants when she comes in is a hug and a kiss from my son. She has done well with asking first which I appreciate but she is obviously bummed when he says/shows he doesn't want to. Then she proceeds to ask multiple times in the span of a few minutes until he either gives her one or I intervene and say to give him some time. While they're here, she tends to follow him around to try to play with him but a lot of the time it's her suggesting things to play instead of her just kind of going with what he wants to do. Then she gets her feelings hurt when my son grabs my dad's hand to have my dad go play with him. She also tells him ""no"" a lot while she's over and I have to remind her that our house is very toddler proof and that he's allowed to get into most things that are within his reach. Then when they go to leave she will go through the whole process of asking him for a kiss. Sometimes he gives her one right off the bat and then she will ask again and again for another one. She has started bringing fruity little candies with her when she comes over. At first, she would try to trade candies for kisses but I put a stop to that. She still uses them as a tool to just get his attention and affections though. She has just become so desperate for his affection that I think it's overwhelming for him. He gets upset when she gets here and has started avoiding her while she's here or while we're at their house. He has started getting upset when she asks for a kiss or hug and I can tell her feelings are hurt.
I do take some responsibility for this because I should have been advocating for him better and correcting her actions along the way. 
Regardless, it's time to have a conversation with her but I don't know where to start or what to say. She's very quick to get upset and disengage but I want this to be a productive conversation. 
I just need some input and advice on this. I want to have this conversation in the nicest way possible but also making sure that boundaries are clear. 
I've gotten mixed responses from friends and I don't want to ask family because I don't want to put anyone in a weird position. Like I said before, I love my mom and she is a wonderful woman. She's not doing any of this with the intention of disrespecting his boundaries. I want my mom to have a great relationship with my son but mostly I want to help my son and reassure him that he has control over what happens with his body. 

Any advice is welcome. However, I will not waiver on the fact that my son has a right to say no to physical affection. I will not force him to hug and kiss anyone, even family. I want him to fully understand consent and have bodily autonomy. So if that's what you're going to suggest then please save your energy and move on. 

ETA-TLDR-my mom is desperate for my son's affection and has been disregarding his boundaries. He has started getting upset when she's around and trying to avoid her. Looking for help on how to have a conversation with her about giving him space and respecting boundaries.

1kku055,update: my 16 year old niece has night terrors,EmbarrassedPop8604,"original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/family/s/07WB6R2wdB

my brother and SIL returned home from their work trip on Friday , so I've been back home since then. 

my niece really started coming out of her shell toward the middle of my time there and reverted back to her depressive shell when I was leaving, she didn't even come out of her room to say goodbye to me.

She texted me yesterday, first time I've heard from her since I left, and told me she hates her school, she doesn't feel like her parents understand what she goes through and she feels more comfortable in my presence because she knows I understand what it's like to struggle in that way

She asked to come spend the summer with my son and I, and if she is on her best behavior that she wants to move in with me and live with me and go to a different school and would promise to help with my son.

I'm genuinely not overly opposed to the idea because my son loves her and I think it could be nice for both of them, I think maybe a change for her could be a fresh start.

But I'd want to see how the summer goes first.

I told her she would need to talk to my brother and her mom first... I heard back from them today and they were pretty encouraging of the idea that they think she would be happier with me even though it breaks their heart they want what's best for her.

I'm curious to know your guys' thoughts on this? 

I guess it's ultimately a family decision, but my son is 4 so I've never ""raised"" a 16 year old before.. I guess ultimately I want advice as an authority figure to her without ultimately being a parent.. I'm genuinely not sure. If she lives with me, do I treat her in the same way as if she were my child? i.e discipline? chores? do I keep being her uncle that she relates to and figure it out as I go the same as I'm doing with my son?",1,2,1747060329.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kku055/update_my_16_year_old_niece_has_night_terrors/

1kkpx4h,Can I just vent about my shitty family for a minute. Not looking for advice or sympathy I just want to rant,No_Material2946,"Well my where the hell do i start? I guess my trauma and mental illness stems a great deal from my mother. She is a toxic, energy sucking vampire who will destroy anyone she deems to be below her..and in her own eyes it's her daughter...me. Growing up I thought I was an angry child. It turns out I'm not I'm very kind and thoughtful..I was just in a family who didn't value or respect me as a person with their own individual wants or needs. Growing up I exhibited normal emotional reactions to things and I was always dismissed and told I'm faking it for attention...I'm manipulative...selfish. all of these words and thoughts stemmed from my narccisitc mother and she instilled them upon my brother and father who both treated me as she treated me. Needless to say I became the black sheep of the family..my brother the golden child who could do no wrong. I never even got into trouble Growing up. I didn't have alot of friends because of my parents so i was doomed to spend my time in our cramped little trailer hearing them fight or they would fight with me. I was always name called from a young age..I was stupid, useless, good for nothing. I could never do anything right in their eyes. I don't know why they hated me so much I never stole..the baddest thing I did as a kid was drink but who didn't. I was just always given a hard time. I dealt with alot of depression and suicide thoughts growing up. I used to cut myself. I remember showing my mother my cuts and she told me i was a lunatic and to never tell anyone or I'm going to a mental hospital. No love or support there....the basis of my life with my parents particularly my mother. No love. So I buried alot of my mental health issues and they festered. I was always so sad and angry living at home being bullied by my parents and limited help. I was a loser growing up I didn't have nice clothes I was over weight..always alone in my house with my crazy parents. Needless to say when I met my first boyfriend at 19 I was over the moon to rush into that relationship and move out. Turns out the hero I thought i was running too ended up physically and mentally abusing me for 4 years. My parents knew about the abuse they seen the bruises and no one protected me. I felt trapped like I couldn't leave the relationship. It was either stay with him and grt abused or go live with my parents and get abused. I wanted neither. Eventually I left my ex and I was able to live on my own with my daughter. But my parents are still involved in my life. They don't help they only shoot off and bring me down. I feel hurt and misunderstood by them that I never got the love and support I needed and deserved growing up or after my abusive relationship. My mother told my ex before she ""knew how I could be"" so she understood...fucked right to say that to a man you know is hitting your daughter. I'm 31 years old I'm tired of letting them have control over my emotions. A part of me still wants a relationship with them but I know it won't happen they are mean and toxic and fail to see their faults. Even now I'm doing better in life I quit drinking and I'm going back to school for nursing and they still are making me out to be a bad person to fit their narrative.

Does anyone else experience this? It’s honestly embarrassing when my friends ask about my family, or when they’re coming in to help move (they never have).

1kkgrjo,Had my mom fill out one of those books that asks a bunch of questions,oooopsiforgot,"TL;DR my mom filled out one of those books with questions about her childhood and life and all that and I read it just now and it was heartwarming and sad too

For Christmas I got one of those books advertised all over social media for a parent to fill out and answer a ton of questions. She gave it back to me on Mother’s Day today and I read through it and UGHHHHH I wish I could hug her younger self.

My mom is really unique - very shy, no friends except my dad and me, didn’t go to college and worked at the same place for 34 years - I don’t want to call her boring but can’t think of a better word. She’s happy as she is but sometimes tells me she feels depressed and lonely because my dad let her retire and she has nothing to do all day. Shes very dependent on my dad and when it’s just she and I, I feel a need to look after her like a child (from a place of care and love). 

Anyways, I just read the book. She left a lot blank because I don’t think she feels like she has a lot of “worthy” things to add. But what she did fill out was so bittersweet to read. So much about being a mom and loving my dad, and I hate she thinks that’s all she is. She answered a lot about her childhood and that was really nice to read as well. It gave me a different perspective of who she is and why she is that way. 

It was a really good reminder that she was a kid and then a young adult before she was a mom and she experienced so much before I existed. 

I do recommend getting these if you want a nice keepsake and something to reflect on every so often. My dad will be giving me his on Father’s Day and expect a much different product lol (in a good way - he’s just different than my mom). I got the books on TT shop but I see them everywhere and they’re pretty inexpensive.

1kkgj7u,Should I stop talking to my parents even if I still live with them?,Own_Awareness466,"I'm a 20 years old guy. Currently living with my parents and one brother, but being honest, I don't know how longer I can take this situation. My relationship with them was always complicated. 

My dad's a good person, but he was an alcoholic for a long time (stopped drinking 5 or 6 years ago after almost dying from an accident cause by himself while drunk), and he's the kind of person who just treats you very well if you're the exact way he wants, so if you do anything different from what he think is good, you're a bad person, a bad son, and you should reflect about your actions. I moved with them to do college, the graduation I wanted was during daytime, so he started pressing me to do it in the night time, because I NEEDED to get a job no matter what, he said that he would not die working just to pay the bills alone basically (good to clarify that I don't have a job but I work informally sometimes and always help them with the little money I receive). So, I ended up doing it, some weeks after that he started trying to convince me to give up college for now because the place where we live now is dangerous at night. I refused because he was the one pressing me for doing it at night, and he started saying that I was selfish and never understood them. There are a lot of different problems in our relationship, but this post will be too long so I'm not going to dive that deep.

My mom... Well, she's unstable. The kind that loves you unconditionally and could die for you, but also the kind of person that almost killed me in a rage burst she had (she literally strangled me more times than I can remember), she also did this to my brothers in other situations. She pointed knives at me when I was a kid for very dumb things I did, and there's a lot of other dysfunctional behaviors she had through time. Like, she's used to act like crazy for nothing and after starts crying as she just realizes what she did after it happened, it's really crazy to watch this kind of thing. And since she started to suspect I'm gay (I'm bissexual but never came out for them for obvious reasons), she started to treat me in a bad way. Everytime I hang out with some friends, when I came home she was always complaining and acting as I was doing something bad (she even said that I was a shame once), because she thought that I was dating a friend of mine by this time. She told me I looked like a beggar once (I have afro hair and wanted to use it without styling sometimes), and there's a lot of other things here too, but for the same reason as the last paragraph, I'm not going to extend this.

So, I think you guys can bet my childhood and life in general was never very chill inside home. My parents did what they could to raise 3 kids while being poor as fuck, and I know they're not bad people because they always tried to give us the best. But, it was always a rollercoaster. Everyday thinking if my mom was going to go crazy by something that I did, or if my dad was going to come home drunk again and they would fight screaming like crazy. It's stressful as a kid not to know if you're safe in your own home. As I grew old, I realized how dysfunctional this was, and that it caused me a lot of problems, besides worsening the problems I already had. It leads to the situation that made me write this:

Some days ago, I was arguing with my dad. I can't remember the subject, but we were both very stressed out. My mom was not part of that talk, but she was looking at me with an ugly face the whole time. Then suddenly she gets up the couch and attacked me. She grabbed me by my hair and threw me in the ground, and then started to beat me. The house was a mix of screams and cursing words. She yelled I was a disrespectful son of a bitch, and other things. One day after that, I decided to go to my sister's house (she lives in another state), because I was tired of that situation. The days were chill, I have a good relationship with her, even when we have a problem we always try to solve it talking and usually it works well. I came back to start college (going to start it tomorrow by the way), but I haven't spoke to my mom since I got here again. I don't want to, she didn't even apologize to me for what she did (actually, she never apologize when she goes crazy like that), but my dad come to me and said I shouldn't act like she's my enemy, and he doesn't want anyone in his house acting like this, because I don't live here alone so I can't ignore them. The thing is, it came to the point where I just came back home because of my graduation. I don't want to suffer anymore because of how they act, they're old now and don't want to change no matter how many times I try to talk about how their behavior isn't healthy. At the same, I feel guilty because of what my dad said to me. I don't want to talk with her, but I don't want to be seem as the villain here. Am I right if I just continue to live without talking to them? Or am I just being childish like he said?

1kkfg5d,Golden child bio sis wanting reconciliation,Ok_Coconut2811,"TW : infant death 
Leaving this up to a poll. Recently I agreed to go low contact with my birth mother since her abusive spouses has recently passed away.
Now my eldest sister has sent me a friend request.
This woman has always been insane and abusive but 3 years ago , my first child passed.
I told her that my son's death is none of her business and that she wasn't allowed to ask me questions about that. 
Then she tells people that me and my spouse are the reason our child passed away , out of spite because I told her to mind her own business about my son passing , whom she was never allowed to meet anyway.
The answer might be obvious , but I came here to ask : reconcile with my sister , accept her friend request ,.and ask her to apologize for falsely accusing me of that out of spite ? 
People actually believe it's true because she said it. 
She only said it because she thought I'd leave my husband but then we got legally married the next year and had another baby. 
Does her reaching out mean she's finally ready to apologize to me? 
Asking for diverse opinions pls. 
I need a good reason to forgive her for what she did to me.",0,3,1747009413.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kkfg5d/golden_child_bio_sis_wanting_reconciliation/
1kketl2,Should I cut my family off?,AMC_Night,"Some context: I'm a 30(f) who is part of a blended family (step mom, step sister, step brother, bio dad, and 3 bio siblings) we all lived and grew up under the same roof (from when I was 10 to 19)

I had a very hard teen life (self harm, trouble at school and with authority and stealing). My mother died when I was 9 and my dad quickly remarried to my step mom and things went down hill from there.

At 19 I moved out with my now husband. I still see my family multiple times a year.

Today, mothers day (I have no kids) and the celebration of my birthday and my step moms (mine is 5/19 hers is today 5/11) my step sister said the most hurtful thing I have heard since I was a teen.

We were all joking about times we had emotional blow outs and how far we've come. I joked about the time she broke the Bluetooth headphones for the TV by throwing them when she was mad. She responded verbatim ""remember the time you cut your self and got blood everwhere.?"" (She had to drop her son of at his dad's and I think she was mad about that)

I was stunned speechless and excused myself to the bathroom where I proceeded to sob then decided to leave the party early with my husband (he didn't hear her say that)

I have always been the black sheep of the family, the troubled one, the scapegoat and rule breaker. Always the topic in therapy.

I've done well for myself, I've got a great union job, a husband and my own place. But every time I see my family, I'm made fun of, belittled and harrased. I'm allowed no peace from the events of a traumatized teen.

The dinner table was FULL, my sister, my sister in law, step brother and step mom and even dad. And no one  came to my defense to what she said. I get horrible anxiety whenever I have to see them. If my step sister isn't bullying me, it's my sister. 

My step mom had the nerve to try to have me stay for my cake, but I couldn't hold it together so I left.

I'm so tired of this, of having no peace, of getting so far just to be kicked back down when you see your family.

He didn't even wish me happy mother's day today,   he called me asking for food.  I cried on the phone and he told me to grow balls.

He lives alone, and he's been fired at every job because he's drinking.

He ONLY has me.   His grandparents from dad's side,  stopped talking to my son when he was 12.   They are rich and they would spoil my son,  once I left his father they blocked us.

His dad is a drunk 

I don't know if it's abandomnet issues, or inherited his dad's alcoholic behavior.   All my family doesn't want anything to doo with my son because of his actions in the past.

1kk9wm0,my sister creepily observes me & copies everything about me & all she talks about is people who like her or show interest in her,BasisFun,"hey everyone i feel extremely uncomfortable around my sister and even just her following me on social media cause she is very observant & observes all my mannerisms & is just way too much like me. ofc were gonna be somewhat alike since were siblings but this is next level.

she has copied everything about me all my life & has admitted to viewing me ""like a greek god, seperate from everyone else"" & i do not mean to sound cocky. i do not view myself like that, she does. shes also told me more than once that she doesnt know who or where shed be without me and that shed be stuck.

while she is observant i also feel she is very oblivious. ill start collecting mugs & cds & shell do the same. once i decided the only meat i wanted to eat was fish & i hear her relaying that this is what shes doing to her friends on the phone.

i will share specific opinions i have & she will relay them to me later as if it came from her. & im not saying she cant agree with my opinions but she relays my opinions to me word for freaking word like she didnt hear it from me first. word. for. word.

i have come to the conclusion that i possibly just dont like her. simply. when we go out to the shops, every. single. person. we walk by, she says ""what was he looking at"" ""what was she looking at"" ""what were they staring at"" ""omg that guy was staring at me"" ""omg that couple stared at me and held eye contact for so long"" and its just sooooooo exhausting to constantly hear.

on top of that, she is always always always talking about ""oh yeah her parents loveee me. they like really like me"" and ""omg i go out and i see a couple and the guy always looks me up and down when hes clearly with his girlfriend"" and ""bruh this guy i used to know kept trying to talk to me while he had a girlfriend"" and the list just goes on.

then shell always tell me about these strangers she has conversations with but the point of the convo is always that theyve said to her ""oh youre a lovely girl"" or something along the lines of that.

she also used to go out a lot with her ex boyfriend pretty much naked, leaving nothing to the imagincation & her boyfriend would say she loves the attention from basically wearing nothing & she used to get really angry when he said that but its true.

and i just want to understand what exactly causes someone to constantly talk about being liked by parents, guys, etc. clearly she very heavily relies on external validation but its to a whole other level and im not judging her, i just would love to hear some opinions as to why this could be. believe me when i say its about 80% of what she talks aobut.

i also hate that it bothers me so much. i dont wanna be around someone like that & all our familt always confuses me and her cause we look & sound alike, even some of her friends have said to me when they tslk to me they feel like theyre talking to a clone of her and i just find it so offensive honestly cause i am nothing like her.

im just tired of this taking up space in my brain, its her life not mine & i dont wanna feel angry about things i cant control.

& she def doesnt realise how much she talks about external validation & whatnot.

but beyond that i am mostly tired of having to watc what i say around her & watch what i post on social media cause she WILL take note of it and copy it someday. and i find it EXTREMELY creepy and it makes me feel so uncomfortable! i have talked to her about this & she just goes silent & says nothing.

i want to focus on my own path & not worry about her copying me. but i know she will cause she doesnt know who she is without me which she has admited and i hate it. i want her to discover who she is and while shes obsessed with external validation, i do not want to talk to her cause it affects and rubs off onto me.

all i want is for her to BE HER OWN PERSON, CARVE HER OWN PATH, & figure out who she is without me!!! i feel like i cant do ANYTHING or pursue ANY of my passions cause shell just follow right after me and nothing has ever made me feel so uncomfortable.

i realise i am ranting. any thoughts are apprecoated. im sure some of you can relate",2,1,1746993703.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kk9wm0/my_sister_creepily_observes_me_copies_everything/

1kk7fxa,How Do You Save a Family That's Falling Apart from Within?,AmbitiousLychee5100,"I want to share something that’s been weighing heavily on me.

In my family, it’s me, my mom, dad, two sisters, my brother, his wife, and their two kids. We all absolutely adore those kids. We shower them with love, care, and attention. My mom, their grandmother, especially goes out of her way to cook their favorite meals and care for them like her own. The bond we all share with those children is strong and full of love.

But the problem is their mother—my brother’s wife. Every morning, she yells at them. Sometimes, she even hits them just because they aren’t getting ready fast enough. These kids are only 10 years old. It’s heartbreaking to see them go through that. She’s always scolding them—either about their studies or just to make them get ready.

The kids clearly prefer the food my mom makes over their mother’s, and they feel safer with her. But their mom often acts in ways that are harsh and emotionally damaging, especially for kids their age. It’s not healthy, and it’s definitely not right.

What hurts even more is her history. After having these kids, she was caught cheating on my brother—not once, but twice. And yet, my mom forgave her. Why? Because of the kids. She worried about who would take care of them if things fell apart.

But this woman has never respected our home. From the beginning, she’s fought with my mom, created constant tension, and now, she’s even started dividing our house. She removed all our things from the upper floor and somehow managed to convince my brother that we are the problem. That we are the ones who don’t want her to live here.

What’s more confusing is how blindly my brother trusts her—despite everything. Even after catching her cheating twice. Even now, I’ve heard from reliable sources that she might still be in touch with another man. I don’t know if it’s true, but it wouldn’t surprise me.

When I try to speak up—when I try to stand up for my mom or the kids—my own father shuts me down. He yells at me like I’m the one tearing the family apart.

It breaks me. We used to be such a close, happy family. My siblings and I shared a strong bond, even after my brother’s marriage—for a while. But ever since she came into our lives, everything’s been falling apart. She’s done things I never imagined someone could do to their own family.

And the worst part? All this drama is draining me emotionally, just when something great is coming up in my career. I should be focusing and preparing, but my mind is trapped in this chaos.

I’m not someone who stays quiet. If the threat were from outside, I’d fight without hesitation. But when it’s your own family tearing itself apart, how do you fight that? How do you protect what’s left without hurting the ones you love?",4,3,1746987299.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kk7fxa/how_do_you_save_a_family_thats_falling_apart_from/

1kk650m,"(25F)(47F) My Mom Doesn’t Trust Me, So She’s Crashing My Work Trip—Guests Aren’t Allowed and we don’t get along",Creepy-Condition5815,"So for some background - I graduated last year with a Pharmacy degree. Where I am from, I have to train for a year then sit an exam in order to be a registered pharmacist. I moved back home after living away for university 5 years and started my training year here, with my exam being 1 month away. The company I work for offer study conferences 4 times a year, where they teach us content, skills and examine us - which has been great so far. Since we’re at the end of the training, our final conference is tomorrow, in a city about 1.5 hours away from me and it’s 4 days (which has been fully expensed by the company and since I’m getting paid, it is mandatory attendance. 

I hope to work as a relief pharmacist, which means going to pharmacies where they need cover - which means I will have to drive to places that may be a fair distance away. I thought if I drove to this conference it will be great way to build up my motorway confidence as I have only driven on motorways for a short distance.

My mom randomly mentioned wanting to come with me to get away, I said she can come with me but she will have to get the train back as I plan on driving (I didn’t expect her to stay over as we are not allowed guests and also 4 days away from home, when I’ll be working full time won’t be fun for her). She said it’s fine she will drive me and stay with me and I honestly lost it. I have been extra stressed for my exam and also i do not get along with my mother. I can’t study at home, I am always in the library after work and on weekends - this is mainly due to my mother distracting me with her BS when I try and study from home. The last thing I would want is to have her stay in my room and disrupt:

1. My study plans (I was extra excited to have a stress free work space and a room to myself)
2. My sleep pattern - she sleeps super late and always has her phone on max volume 
3. The last time I will spend with my colleagues as I am not staying within my company 
4. Building my driving confidence and she wants to drive me
5. Just my peace as I was looking forward to getting away from this toxic bubble and just enjoying my own space 
6. I actually took switched my Friday shift for a Saturday as I wanted to spend an extra night away from home 

She took my reaction as suspicious and is now forcing me to either call in sick or that she will drive me and stay with me and want evidence of my timetable.

1kk4l5b,"I’m [23F], and my dad (48M) recently told me he’s having a baby — and it’s hard to process having a sibling with a 20+ year age gap.",Single-Chemistry-284,"This morning, on the weekend of my  graduation, my dad pulled me aside before heading to the airport and hit me with, “You’re going to have another sibling.”

I’m 23F. I have two brothers (25M and 17M), and we’re all from the same mom and dad, who were married for 19 years and divorced 4 years ago. We’ve always had a super tight sibling bond, and I’ve always loved being the only girl/middle child in that trio. I even remember telling my parents when they divorced, “Please don’t have any more kids.” Not out of spite, just because I really liked our family dynamic the way it was and there’s men in my family who have numerous kids from different women and there’s big sibling age gaps as well. I just didn’t want that for me.

So now… my dad’s having another kid. I knew he could, since he’s only 48, but I really didn’t think it would happen. And the worst part is I’ve never even met the woman he’s having the baby with. He’s never mentioned her, never said he was dating anyone. I don’t know her name, what she looks like… nothing. And apparently, she doesn’t even live in the U.S. So I have no idea how I’d even see this child or build any kind of relationship with them.

I feel shocked, honestly. And kind of betrayed that he chose this moment — my graduation weekend — to randomly drop this on me like I’d be overjoyed. I couldn’t even fake excitement. I just said, “Oh… really? Wow.”

What makes it harder is that I’ve always cherished close family bonds. And now I’m looking at a 20+ year sibling age gaps. Like, what kind of relationship can we even have? I want to be close with this sibling, that part is really important to me but I’m scared we won’t be able to form a real bond. I don’t want to feel like a distant relative or just someone who occasionally checks in. I want a genuine sibling connection, but I don’t know if that’s even realistic with how far apart we’ll be in age, lifestyle, and proximity.

And part of me feels guilty for being so negative about it. My dad is clearly happy. But I’m sitting here just… not. I feel like everything I liked about my sibling dynamic is being rewritten and I don’t really like the feeling. is it valid to feel like this? Or am I being selfish?

Edit: Just to clarify — I’m not mad at the baby or upset that a child is being born. I know none of this is their fault. I’m just really struggling with the personal adjustment and what it means for my family dynamic, especially when this is something I never thought would actually happen. Growing up, my dad was always super firm about not wanting more kids. The topic came up a bunch of times in our house, and he was always like, “Three is enough.” So when I said, “Please don’t have any more kids,” during the divorce, it wasn’t something they took badly. That’s why this caught me so off guard. I truly didn’t think more siblings were ever going to be part of the picture.

I want to get out of here due to multiple reasons:
1) want a change of culture
2) want to experience a different city lifestyle 
3)want to live alone or away from parents because they are the reason my 70/80% of my mental health is struggling due to physical and emotional abuse over the years and taunting and looking down on me never appreciating me no matter what good or appreciation worthy thing I do.
my sister already lives in another city and I cook every night's dinner for my parents coz they come home @ 8 something plus mom is pre diabetic which requires her to have dinner as soon as she reaches home. i have been cooking for them since a good 4 years now but when it comes to me wanting a change and getting away from them mom tries to put off the subject by saying the other city doesn't have good colleges and if you are going to do masters u have to do it in our city only. from their pov they already have one daughter living away they don't want to let go of another one plus who will cook for them once I am gone ?? 
why are they being selfish and self- centred?
why are they being so possessive about me and giving me the cage treatment? bottom line I am going to get away from them and my city as soon as possible coz a few more months of being treated like shit in my own house and i will end up having a depressive episode because this behaviour has been metted out to me and my sister since our childhoods. no wonder she left the house the first chance she got. she's doing fine and is doing a job in another city.
enough of being assaulted and being beaten 
up every alternate day just for existing. there were times I was made to hate my existence because they used to taunt me saying "" konse muhurat pe janam liya tha tune "" as if I forced them into birthing a second child and bringing me to the world.
even if I don't get a master's admission this year ,I'll find a job somewhere and someplace else.i can literally just starve myself the whole day and eat something little if I have to but I need to GET TF AWAY FROM THEM ASAP

Immediate family now includes me and my husband, my daughter, son-in-law, and their 2 children, plus my other daughter and her 2 children. This year we decided to include my daughter's roommate and her child. To be clear, my daughter and her roommate are not gay. However, we consider part of the family and have previously welcomed her into holiday gatherings at our home. Adding her to this trip required a bit more effort, to find a large enough place. And yes, my husband and I are paying. 

The trip is coming up in a few weeks. On previous trips, everyone spent lots of time as a group with all meals and many activities being shared. Each group member signed up to make a meal or two. The previous trips made good memories. 

Adding the roommate has changed the dynamics of the trip. Now it appears as if my daughter, her roommate and their 3 children plan to be away from the rest of us most of the trip. This was supposed to be a family trip! Based on what I'm seeing thus far, the roommate won't be invited next time.

1kjzc5p,Walking on eggshells: Raging sister's episodes are getting tiresome - mental health issues?,Mobile_Comment_8192,"Just trying to understand my sister and how she reacts to things. Example:

Scenario: My sister is driving, my mom is in the passenger seat and my nephew and I in the back seat. We're coming back from a nice Mother's Day outing at a nursery yesterday. 

We suddenly come up on stopped traffic (small suburban two lane road) and my sister has to slam on the brakes (I think partly b/c of traffic, I think partly b/c she tends to be a fast-ish driver and was all animated and into a story she was telling). Next thing I know she's pulled to the side of the road and starts screaming at our mother about how Mom's reaction to the suddenly stopped traffic wasn't safe. 

Context: Mom was in a traumatic car accident last fall with her husband who was driving, had a medical incident, passed out, and the car accelerated down a neighborhood street before crashing into the side of a house, all while my mom watched this in real time from the passenger seat. Airbags deployed, bricks from a chimney fell on to the car and Mom didn't know if she or her husband were going to die in the next second. She's not had any triggering episodes regarding driving since then until this experience with my sister this weekend. Also, two weeks ago, her husband/our stepdad died suddenly, so we're all trying to deal with that grief.

My sister picks up on the fact that Mom is likely triggered by what just happened but instead of pulling off to the side and taking a minute, she flys off the handle, basically yells at mom ""I know you're probably triggered right now by what just happened but you can't scream like that when I'm driving because it could cause an accident!""

(I absolutely did not hear mom scream but I suspect mom did make her typical panic sudden ""AH!"" and gets jumpy when traffic stops suddenly - this is a common thing). 

My mother starts sobbing and cowering in her seat for the next 45 minutes as my sister gets on the highway and proceeds to drive nearly 80mph home - she's clearly upset/stressed herself and in typical sister fashion, road rages. We also nearly get into ANOTHER accident on the highway because someone started to come into our lane on the right without seeing us and my sister was trapped b/c of a truck on our left - thus adding even more tension to the environment. Sister pulls over and continues to rage at us before speeding home again.  
  
my sister makes it very clear she's upset because while she understands mom was likely triggered by the traffic situations, she feels like she was being judged for her driving (like she's been judged and dismissed for everything else she does in her life, she said).

It was like, whoa, WTF dude. let's take a step back. this is NOT about you. I did not say that though as I'm frankly scared to death of my sister and when she's in this ""OMG THE WORLD HATES ME"" mode, you can't say anything to her and expect her to react reasonably. she'll just come back even more angry. it's usually best just to walk away, even if it angers her even more. something my therapist has taught me recently - you can't be responsible for someone else's feelings. Part of me feels she is just constantly wanting to feel validated and seen but it's hard to do that on my end when there is wall of rage there.  
  
When we got back to my sister's apartment, mom quietly asked that my sister listen to her, to please not yell and just listen. Mom explained in further detail, while sobbing and shaking, how traumatic the car accident was and how my sister's driving is incredibly scary when going 80mph on a highway where the limit is 65 and my sister needs to understand all this. 

Well, hell froze over because my sister APOLOGIZED - she never does that. but later, when I'm trying to assess if we should leave (we live two hours south of my sister) or try to salvage the day, I talk with my sister about if she wants to go to dinner with us and she says ""sure, I'll put on my fake smile and be nice like I have my entire life with my family even though I'm always judged for what I do and how I do things and I'll never be good enough."" 

JFC. 

Sure I've probably judged her for her actions and reactions to things I don't understand (who doesn't) but as I've learned recently more about her ADHD recently, it's explained a lot about her and her decisions and how she approaches things in life, and I can better understand how to interact with her - but still doesn't explain the flying off the handle and rage that our entire family has to endure from her. 

Like, we're scared to say anything sometimes and walk on eggshells around her b/c we have no idea is she's going to explode or be chill. even something as simple as making a suggestion or offering to help with something.

After this Mother's Day incident, aside from wanting to completely cut my sister off my from mom and I to protect ourselves (I'd kid nap my nephew too if I could), I just wonder what else is going on? 

For context, I do get that she has a LOT going on too: she's a single mom working in the legal field, has a young teen son, an asswipe of an ex-husband, and drinks WAY too much (it's like a switch flips in her after a couple - I refuse to pick up the phone when she calls late at night). 

But after this incident, part of me has suddenly thought maybe there is something else going on, like bi-polar going on b/c her mood swings can be so ... wild. My poor nephew has to endure this daily - he has no idea what kind of mood his mother is going to be in when she gets home.  
  
maybe this was more of a rant or vent or unloading but also... anyone dealt what siblings who they walk on eggshells around?

  
TL;DR - we walk on eggshells around my sister and we're tired off it. ",1,1,1746964651.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjzc5p/walking_on_eggshells_raging_sisters_episodes_are/

1kjyv7z,She chipped away at me so slowly that I didn't even realise until I was left with nothing.,UKDave23,"This relationship ended nearly 9 years ago but I don't know if I'll ever get over it.

At 20 years old, I had recently ended a four year relationship with my first girlfriend, and I think it would be fair to say that it was a relatively clean break up with few hard feelings. Some months later, I received a happy birthday message from a girl I used to got to school with. Let's say her name is Josie. After some back and forth, we ended up going on a date. Now, as much as I despise her now, I can admit that I was absolutely smitten by her at the time. So much so, that looking back now, I looked passed and ignored so many red flags but hey, I was a naive 20 year old who really liked a girl, and more importantly, I had certain non-negotiable principles that ended up being my own undoing.

Some back story for Josie, when I knew her at school at 14, 15 years old, she was relatively quiet. Not one of the popular kids but not exactly bottom of the pile nerds either. We never interacted much apart from a few jokes and balls of paper thrown at her in class but no one ever had any issues with her. When we first got together, she had told me a lot about her ex boyfriends, who all ended up being abusive. Particularly her last one who had been both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to her. As a kid who grew up in foster car and kids homes due to abuse I received as a child, I was very sympathetic, but it also hilighted to me that I wanted to make her feel safe given our shared experience despite it's differences.

The first ignored warning. It's important to note that this was within the first few weeks. My band played an acoustic gig at a city centre night club to support a then big band called The View, famous for their hit single Same Jeans, right in the middle of the whole British indie phase. My band mates invited some of their friends to come and watch and I invited Josie. We played our set which went well, and enjoyed the rest of the night. When we got back to my place, she asked why I kept looking at one of my band mates friends whilst I was on stage. She said while we was playing, she overheard her and her friend talking about me and that she thought I was attractive and that I kept on looking at her while I was playing. I explained that I wasn't looking at anything whilst onstage apart from either my guitar, or my band mates because when you look out to the audance, all you can see is silloettes due to the lights pointing at us. Josie turned into a different person altogether, she went from arguing, to screaming, to insulting, to breaking the relationship off altogether. This is where STUPID young 20 year old me really messed up. I really liked this girl, so I, the ""chivalrous night"" fought to calm her down and fight for our new relationship until eventually, me and Josie were back on. She apologised for how she acted, she shed some tears, and I comforted her and reassured her. Little did I know that this would become a pattern in our relationship.

About a month in, I received a text from Josie saying ""I don't think we should be together."" At first she wouldn't tell me why, but after about an hour's worth of back and forth and me almost begging her to tell me what's wrong, she eventually tells me that she has depression and is bipolar. It turns out, she's always had depression which was brought on by the abuse she received in previous relationships, her Dad abandoning her, and the abuse she received from her Mum. She told me that her Mum had her sectioned in her teens. This resulted in low moods, and suicidal tendencies. 20 year old me in 2010 hasn't got a clue what any of that means so I head to Google and look up depression. Low moods, lack of motivation and so on, but hey, I'm a ""chivalrous night"" remember, so it's my job stand by someone when things get hard, when they need love and support, and to not judge. So I go ahead and tell her that it doesn't matter to me, and in my own time, proceed to look up, how to support or help someone with depression. I look back now and I was so nieve, so immature, but I had an idea of how a man should be, and I really wanted to do right by her. Little did I know that this would be used in EVERY argument moving forward.

After some time, we decided to move in together. We got a flat, had it all decorated and furnished and hoped to begin our new life. This is where things gradually escalated. Josie had a temper over the smallest things. There would be a huge fight, she would say she warned me or told me what she was like, and that we shouldn't be together. I would try to calm her down and talk. She would cry and apologise, blame her depression and I would always tell her, ""tomorrow is a new day."" These episodes escalated more with more shouting, more aggression until eventually, one arguement she hit me. I will never forget it. I was so shocked, hurt, and confused. I didn't really know what to do. We lived in a high rise flat next to a dual carriageway way that comes off the motorway leading in and out of the city. She was threatening to kill herself by running into traffic so I wouldn't let her out of the flat. So he pulled a knife out of the drawer and I had to prize it off of her and hide the knives, so she started climbing out of the window so I pulled her down and locked it. She hit me again. Unfortunately, Google did not qualify me to deal with this so I called the police. The police came to our flat, I told them what happened, she told them that I was keeping her prisoner in the flat but I explained that she was threatening to kill herself and showed them the hidden knives that I had taken off her. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and I said no. I hoped that this would be enough to scare her in to not hitting me again. Guess what, she warned me and told me we shouldn't be together. Why did she act like this? It was because of her depression (which she warned me about.) she cried, she apologised, I told her tomorrow is a new day, I understand, but you don't need to worry because I won't abandoned you. I can't even tell you the amount of times that I had to lock windows, pull knives off of her, take away bleach, take away tablets and pull her out of roads before repeating the the whole explanation and forgiveness, to reassurance process again until it just became normal. Arguments because more personal using any insecurities to insult me. Skinny little rat was a favourite of hers given my insecurity about my weight at the time. She would threaten to get her male friends to pick her up. Run to her family, tell them her side of the story which was mostly lies until her family pretty much hated me even after we made up. She carried on hitting me, progressed to throwing things at me, and began using my own affection towards her against me.

Before you judge me on the next bit, I want you to remember that I was young, and I really did love her a lot. Her lack of self-control due to depression made it so that this wasn't her fault, and leaving her didn't even cross my mind because, what kind of man abandons some one who is ill. We decided to have a baby together. During the the pregnancy, things got worse. She started hitting me more often and now, this unborn child became a new and effective weapon against me. She would threaten to run away with the baby, threaten to make sure I'll never see the baby ect. As mentioned before, I grew up in care. It's a complicated back story but I was beaten and abused as a child, went into foster homes, was adopted, then ended up back in foster homes, to ending up in a kids home until ending up in my own flat at 16 where at some point I reconnected with my adopted parents. I had experienced a lot of abuse, a lack of stability, but I knew if and when I ever became a Dad, I would do every thing I could to be the best I could be. And in 2012, my dream came true and we had a beautiful daughter. We moved in to a house, and my parents paid for some of Josie's car lessons and tests so we could manage easier.

Just writing things as I go, trying to remember things, back in the  2010's onwards, going out clubbing and drinking was a big thing and Josie was out around once a week drinking. Short skirts, high heels, and lots of alcohol. I don't drink so didn't go out with her plus she was with her own friends which would have been weird. Bit it did get to a point where I felt she was living a single girl life. As you can tell, we argued a lot and she would go out drinking with her friends and whilst out, she would post photos on Facebook of her posing and poutong next to random men. After the birth of our daughter this didn't slow down. If I'm honest, when with our daughter, this didn't really affect her parenting. She was naturally really good with babies having lots of nieces and nephews and I like to think that our baby was oblivious to most things although that probably wasn't the case. This changed a year later when we unexpectedly had another daughter. As our first grew older, she was quite clearly a Daddy's girl. This meant that our second daughter was glued to Josie's hip all of the time. She didn't like anyone apart from Josie. Grandparents, friends, aunties, cousins and sometimes, even me! And Josie made sure of that. This began to change as time went on as whilst I was really poor with babies, toddlers and kids I was really good with. Josie began to build a resentment towards both of the children but mainly our eldest who was still very clearly a daddies girl. She would shout and swear at them during her episodes and threaten to hit them. But of course during episodes with me she would threaten to run away with them, tell them lies about me. The children were an effective tool to control me. There were numerous occasions where we were all in the car, Josie would speed up dangoursly and threaten to drive us all into a wall or a tree which terrifying. 

My life hadn't quite gone how I expected at this point. I had a lack of job stability working in sales where at one point I was working 16 hours a day shifts at a call centre. I was struggling financially as, Josie would take credit out in my name for catalogues and left lots of bills unpaid in my name to fund her night life clubbing and drinking. I was underweight being 5 foot 10, and 60 Kilograms (around 130 pounds.) I was hiding the fact that the woman I loved was hitting me, insulting me due to the shame and humiliation. I no longer spoke to my friends as if I made plans, she would be fine with it, then start an argument on that day until I didn't go out, and then people stopped inviting me out. I hated my self, my body, and my life, but at the time I blamed myself and my ability to provide for the the family so I decided to talk to Josie about doing something that I'd always wanted to do to get her thoughts on it. 

After a long conversation, I decided to join the British Army at 26 years old. Not a desicion to take lightly but I wanted financial stability for Josie and our children and I wanted to do it with her blessing to make sure that we were as team in this desicion. After competition all tests and assessments, the time came to begin basic training so we got to the train station and Josie and my daughters waved me off crying. Let me tell you that basic training was almost hell for me and it had nothing to do with the Army. Texts started off as supportive, to asking for more money, to finding out rent was not being paid, to asking for all my wages. Then to telling me she wasn't happy and wanting to be single, then to loving me, then to asking me if I was ok with her doing fetish photoshoots, to then bring told I'm controlling when I didn't like it, to then everything being ok. Until I received a text from one of her sisters that Josie was on a date with another man. I frantically called Josie repeatedly who did not pick up. Her sister told me that they had been dating for a while and he was sleeping at my house which Josie eventually denied until she couldn't. When I found this out, it felt like somebody had yanked my heart out of my chest. I look back and pity me back then but despite everything I had gone through, I really did love her and I really tried my best to be the man I wanted to be. I may not have got it right all the time but I really wanted to do right by her. As usual, Josie turned nasty, she insulted me, threatened that I'd never see my daughter's, threatened to kill them on multiple occasions and emptied my bank account. This was the point where I decided I'd had enough. 

I contacted my bank for all the unauthorised uses (some of which paid for family days out with Josie, my daughter's, and this new guy) thats right, the guy that was sleeping with my fiancé, in my bed, was taking my family out, using my money! I called social services as Josie was threatening to kill our daughters. And I called the police and reported all of the abuse I had received over the years. Josie begged for us to stay together for a long time. She would not stop begging and she pulled out every trick imaginable, sympathy, empty promises, victimhood, depression, suicide, you name it. Eventually, my anger subsided and was replaced with sympathy which lead to me cancelling my fraud claim with the bank, and cancelling my report to the police, something I regret to this day. 

She began telling me about this guy she was seeing telling me they argued because she found a bag of cocaine in his bag and that he was abusive ect. Eventually, I finished 3 months of basic training and went on to more training which was 5 months in barracks located near my hometown we were heading towards a somewhat amicable break up until one day. Me and a female colleague had finished a training module and the cook house was closed so I drove us to KFC to get tea. Josie must have  seen us eating in the car and before I knew it, my car door had been swung open and Josie, who was with her sister, was screaming and swearing at me and my colleague. She hit me, scratched me, and took my car keys until I called the police. I told them everything that happened but Josie told the police that I hit her. Any hope of an amicable break up was lost at that point.

Josie carried on seeing this new man and he quikly moved in with her and my daughters which I wasnt happy about given they had been together barely two months but there was nothing I could do. Until, I got a call from the police saying my daughters had been involved in a domestic incident. It was reported that the new guy had got into a physical altercation with Josie Infront of the children and they were reopening a case for the children with social services. They deemed that the new guy was a danger to the children and that there was not to be anywhere near them.

A master manipulator, after some time, social services reported no concerns, the police never seemed to take me or my concerns seriously, and Josie seemed quite content in lying to authorities and spreading lies about me to friends and family but as far as I was concerned. I was done. All I cared about was makeing sure I was doing everything I could as a dad for my daughters who were now, my one and only priority. After some time, things calmed down, and me and Josie had a long discussion. We talked about everything thet had happened in our relationship, during the break up and how nasty things has got. Baring mind this was 8 years ago but I still remember a lot of this conversation. I remember saying, ""I don't get things right all the time but I really do think I'm a good man, and I only ever meant right by you"" she just said, ""I know."" We talked about some of the things she had done like threatening to kill us all. Shouting and swearing at the kids, introducing them to a new man whilst we're still engaged behind my back"" she cried saying ""I'm a shit mum,"" and I tried to comfort her. We eventually agreed that our daughters might have a better chance with me as the primary carer until she can deal with whatever mental issues. We spoke to social sevices and completed some paperwork to get the ball rolling.

Things were looking like they would start to work themselves out until I received a phone call informing me that the new guy is still in a relationship with Josie and is now spending time with our daughters again. This is where I had to make one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. If I report it, Josie will kick off and stop the whole process of making me our daughters primary carer, but at least the authories know and I can guarantee our daughter's safety. Or, don't report it, keep Josie sweet, can continue to the process of becoming out daughters primary carer, but this means putting our daughters in danger. I need them with me, I need to make sure that they're being looked after properly, but what if I say nothing and something happens to them. I only had one choice. I couldn't not risk my own daughter's safety so I had no choice but to report it. Bit I know what the conciquences would be. Sure enough, I received a phone call and hour later from Josie. ""Did you fucking report me to social services?"" ""Don't think you're getting them girls, I'll make sure you don't fucking see them.""

Turns out to cover her tracks, she introduced the same man to our daughters under another name to trick them into thinking it was someone else to avoid scrutiny from social services. Then she blamed me. Then she said that it wasn't him that abused her but it was her abusing him. Then during the court process, CAFCSSS (who are scum) pulled police records were Josie was reported to be involved in 8 physical domestic desputes (not including the reports I made) so she was never a victim of her ex like she told me when we first got together, but it was the other way round. We ended up going to court where we agreed share cared custody.

So much has been missed out but anyway, this brings us to 2020. Things have been shaky but it's the best of a bad situation. I'm seeing our daughters regularly but not nearly as much as I'd like but they are pretty much the only thing that kept me going. I'm in a relationship with Josie's complete opposite, a kind hearted, caring and just an amazing woman who my daughters have taken to really well. And this is where my once estranged adopted parents come in.

A bit of back story with them for ease, I'll refer to them as mum and dad but they in no way deserve this title. During my time with them as a child Dad was what I considered a good example of a family man. Worked really hard for the family. Didn't have too much to say but when he did, you listened, could work on and fix anything. Mum had a loving side but was constantly nagging, shouting, and very strict. If you were on her bad side. She would be really spiteful. Dad had two daughters already and remarried to my mum. Mum adopted me and my brother and then later on adopted a girl who we considered our sister. All in all, I had 3 sisters and one brother. From what I gather, my dad and his ex fought in court until my dad resfused to be emotionally and financially blackmailed and decided to hope that his daughters (our step sisters) come and find me when they were older, so we no longer saw them. My adopted sister had enough of mum and dad and decided to go back in to care when she was 14 or 15. My little brother had had enough decided to go back into care when he was 9 or 10, and finally I had had enough and I decided to go back into care when I was 13. Mum was overbaring, manipulative, and at times, plain mean. However, at around 17, we reconnected, talked about the past and moved on. Now as much as I hate them now, I can't lie, whilst I was with Josie. They didn't know anything about what was happing to me in terms of the abuse, and when things got unmanageable financially, they bailed me out. Mum would often try to meditate and they were generally much more chilled out and supportive than when I was a kid. I made a lot of effort with them and undoubtedly they made alot of effort with me. But things changed when I deployed to the Falkland Islands for 6 months. I had been in my new relationship for some time now and I could tell my mum wasn't keen but it was manageable, but my parents absolutely could not stand Josie. We realised however that my mum had to keep up the mediator/friend role with Josie so that we could make sure that our daughters where either sort me, or my parents rather than Josie so we could take advantage of the fact that Josie would take any opportunity to get rid of the kids. That way, we knew, they were being looked after and brought up properly. Before leaving for the Falklands, me, my girlfriend, and my parents agreed that they have them as much as Josie aloud to make sure they're looked after properly. Whiled deployed, tensions were growing between my girlfriend and mum. Mum would message saying my girlfriend made no effort with them, I'd bring it up, and then my girlfriend would send screenshot messages of her inviting my mum to do things and getting ignored. This sort of thing started causeing a small rift between us but manageable and easily repaired. COVID hit which made everything worse but Josie barely had our daughters throughout most of it so I was content.

When I came home after 6 months. Everything seemed. Mum seemed off. She was dictating contact with my daughter's between everyone one, and I began to get frustrated, so I called a family meeting to try and solve it. We all addressed our concerns, mum admitted that she has become really attatched to the girls, and admitted she had stepped over the like and articulated why which was understandable. At the time, things seemed more or less resolved. Some time later, I was on a two week deployment and received a phonecall from mum about having the kids at some particular dates. However this was during a period I was home for leave so I said no but I'm deploying for two weeks here so you can have them then but when I'm home, I need to spend time with them. Mum got very agressive, shouted and hung up. I called Josie straight after and asked her when it comes to seeing the girls, as we are the parents, can we organise dates please as my mum is trying to dictate everything, you know what she's like, Jodie laughed and said ye, that's fine. I get another call from mum kicking off so I hung up and carried on with work. I arrive back from deployment and I'm lifting my bags from the back of an SV and my phone vibrates as a message has come through from Josie. She says that I'm no longer aloud to see the children, that I have abused them, and that they're not safe around me or my girlfriend. My head was spinning with shock, confusion, and panic. 

I let my mum know straight away who seemed just as shocked, so I start making some phone calls to social services, turn out, Josie called raising concerns after being informed by grandmother, (my mum) of I'll treatment from me to the children.  So call my parents to my house and confront them. They she admits it than starts saying how I treat the children is wrong, and that I've changed since coming back from the Falklands. I said this is because of the family meeting, you wanting to dictate who does what and nothing to do with how I parent. I also onto remind them of thier parenting when we was kids which resulted in all of us choosing to go back into the care system. Spitting on us when we were naughty, banging our skulls together when arguing, or developing a stutter because I was scared of saying three wrong thing. The conversation went nowhere and she just said I think it's best we don't see each other again, and that was that.

This time I was preparing. I downloaded every text of Josie's abuse, sound recordings of her abuse and violence, photos of marks she left on me, every catalogue, bill, and debt she hadn't paid that got left to me because I was the only one working, pictures of my credit score at 200 points to 750 points in 5 years as she no longer has access to my accounts, letters from the girls to me and my now fiance, pictures. Every accusation had a rebuttal with proof. I used the freedom of information act to request all social services records, medical records, police records, and school records. These raised 18 occasions where an authority pointed out Josie had been dishonest, multiple occasions where she has put our daughters in danger, records that shoe Josie had been mentally, physically and emotionally abusive to at least 3 men, had been violent to her own family members. Character witnesses, whiteness statements from Josie's own family. I wanted the truth finally out there. Spent hundreds on stationary and hundreds of hours reading every available document with a fine comb. A rather clever move from Josie was tell child maintenance that I hadn't paid anything which put me in a nice chunk of debt. Stupid me set up child maintenance to stop Josie from trying to extort more money from me. Then all of Josie's debts came through like unpaid rent, catalogues and unpaid council tax, so we agreed, I'll pay the debts, and when that's paid, I'll carry on paying you. All of her debts were paid off, told child maintance she hadn't received a penny from me, now I get to pay it all over again straight from my wages. 

We had CAFCASS meetings where I presented everything. They wouldn't even look at it, we had pre hearings where I was questioned like a criminal, we spoke to CAFCASS again explained what was in the folder we sent them. Proof of everything I've been saying. Not he said she said, black and white official documents proving I've been telling the truth the whole time. CAFCASS go on to write a section 7 that I received in the mail which contains their reccomendations to the courts. I read it and just burst in to tears. I just couldn't understand how or why. I sat there thinking of ways to kill myself, should I leave a note? What would I say? I called Samaritans, didn't know what to say, how to start, could barely speak. He tried to help. Just a volunteer. But he was just irritating me, of course I looked at this legal thing, of course I have evidence. USELESS. But it wasn't his fault. I just hung up.

I eventually went home from work. Christmas was approaching, we still need to buy this and that for daughters, my fiance's says I don't think they're going to be home for Christmas. All this time I tried to put up a facade of resilliance for her, we keep fighting, trust the system, just tell the truth and she'll trip up over her own lies, karma, all that rubbish but it hit home that they weren't coming back from Christmas. I had a pile of presents ready but no one would be here to open them. Christmas day arrived and instead of celebrating it with my the people I love the most, I'm thinking of whether or not to jump 30 meters from a prominent bridge in our city to the water. But I've still got some fight, back to Google, back to the drawing board. I dropped £4000 on a solicitor who gave me poor advice, and a form to fill in to send to CAFCASS and their solicitor with requests. That's £4000 I'll never get back. I request a phycological assessment for the courts and this ends up being exactly what I needed, we went there l, took my 500 page folder with me, she asks me questions, I answer then proove with evidence, she raises questions about how the case was handled, Josie is interviewed where she lies, the kids are interviewed which catches out more lose from Josie. She's never been diagnosed with a mental health condition, she does have a history of violence in relationships, she's shown to consistently lie or manipulate facts, she reported as manipulating our daughters against me. She says she suffered abuse from her mum, and abuse from me, and even compares me to her mum. It even mentions mums part in it. I have finally been vindicated! I have all this evidence printed, I have a phycologist confirming what I'm saying. This really felt like the break through I needed.

After this, supervised visits begin, the lady supervising says, from what I've seen, I really don't understand why I'm here, and after two visits, we get unsupervised visits. This is where things turn, my elders daughter tells me that she's had suicidal thoughts. A child. Whatever Josie and mum has fed to these kids, even if it is all lies, it's real to them. They're just kids, how are they supposed to know. I try talking with her. And that's the last time a saw both of them. 

CAFCASS carried on with their narrative, disregarded everything the the phycologist said, disregarded all evidence, Josie basically has this pink haired, overwait scumbag feminist in her pocket, and me? I represented everything that woman clearly hated. There was no winning this case, after everything I had submitted and proven, I was no better off than day one. And worse still, because of the fighting, because of the intervention by so many people, my children were being affected whereby my eldest was suicidal. I submitted a position statement airing my grievance, but withdrawing my participation in the farce that is the so called family courts that hide behind the anonymity of children to conduct themselfes in a way that suits them without accountability. 

I haven't seen my two daughters since 2022 and I think about them everyday. I try to keep up with their lives where I can such as school reports but I really know very little about them now. I know they hate me, Josie and my mum did a good job in turning them against me and I'm sure they've told them I gave up on them but I haven't at all. I'm just waiting for the day they come back to find me. I'm so bored of social media but I want them to be able to find me easily even though I'm sure Josie will have blocked me on their accounts. If they Google my name, I'm always near the top of results but I just don't know what they've been told about me or if they'll ever look for me.

I have a four year old daughter with my fiancé. For the first year or so I fell into a deep depression where I didn't go out. I felt guilty having fun or experiencing happiness without my daughter's. Me and my fiancé talk about them all the time and our daughter asks about them. We're now experiencing life again, letting our daughter experience what they did like adventures, learning, school and so on, but there's such a large hole from the gap that they leave. I really wish in anyway that hole is filled up again. 

As for my so called parents, mums disabled, on plenty of tablets, and in constant pain for the rest of her life. Dad is a door mat that waits on her hand on foot, can't even take a shit in peace. They move to new houses after destroying relationships with neighbors once they figure out what they are really like. As far as I know they see the girls regularly and tell people that their son, presumably me, is an alcoholic. Mum even tells people she was a barrister. Those lies got set straight though as someone always knows some one who knows someone. Last time I saw them they were picking Josie up from court with me. I had them removed as McKenzie friends but I was nice to see Thier support after telling me they wouldnt get involved in supporting me in court when it all started to happen. I genuinely wish them a long life as they've lost 5 children who never want to speak to them, they don't speak to parents or their siblings. They have absolutely no one apart from the chronic pain and loneliness for the rest of their lives. Almost makes you believe in karma.

As for Josie, I don't know anything about her life and I'm not interested. I loved her once and don't think she'll ever know the effort I made to try and make her happy. After everything she did to me, I don't think she has an ounce of guilt. She won. I lost our daughter's and I'm absolutely sure that makes her very happy. She took every opportunity to look smug in court. I've seen bits and bobs a long time ago about her promoting people to stand up against domestic violence, about suffering with BPD, Bipolar, and every other mental health disorder that she was never diagnosed with which tells me she can't feel guilty because she genuinely believes her own lies. I do wonder if she ever has random thoughts of guilt though. Maybe about taking away their daughters Dad, or about what she put me through. But I doubt it.

And me, I'm due to be married to the woman of my dreams. We rearly disagree nevermind argue. I have a promising career in the military, joined an elite infantry unit, the Ranger Regiment, part of special operations briagde. Have been awarded a 2 star commendation and mentioned on the kings new year's honours list for my service to date, broke world records, in the best shape of my life, and travel everywhere enjoying life while we have it. I'm just patiently waiting for my family to be whole again.

While there, we met up with some of her old family including her cousin. Soon after that I found out they are were dating (can’t really remember details of this) and my family was pretty shocked but kind of accepted it eventually. I also tried to accept it but I just couldn’t, although i’ve never shown it. Now it’s got to the point that I can’t even look at them. I guess it’s just been bottled up for so many years and i don’t know what to do. I don’t want to fuck up mine and my mums relationship, but also not theirs because my mum is really happy. What the fuck do i do at this point?

For context he’s adopted so in their head it’s fine? i guess idk. Hate that concept too. Does being adopted not make you family?

1kjxhix,I think I remembered my Father touching me inappropriately as a child,dexmchna,"But no one will believe me, well legally.. he's been terrorizing me mentally by neglecting me since I was a child, he also gave me the blame for everything bad happening to them, even for loosing money due to being bad in school and needing after school lessons, all that made me very depressed and a bit damaged which resulted in psych ward visits (one when i was living with him and one when with my mom afterwards due to the damage) 

I've had so many issues that I never thought about this closer, but recently i've put 1 and 1 together and understood how disgusting it was that he randomly, when we were alone one day in my room at his flat after the divorce w my mom, put his fingers in my pants with no reason at all

I looked at him uncomfortable and then he pulled them back and said ""oh you don't like this?"" and then left the situation

She gave half of her own plate to that ingrate who had been sitting in his room all day playing video games. This is just so annoying. Her whole life is about my brother. I'm just an afterthought. In fact, she herself comes secondary. When I do well at school its because I am a slugger. When he fails or does violent activities its because ""boys will be boys"". I mean she's not abusive. She's quite supportive of me but I hate that for her my brother's always a priority.

I live in Italy--long story--moved for love--well established with my life here. My sisters and I have a storage unit that we have shared the cost of for about ten years now and I can't afford to pay for it any longer. Storage is located near Milford MA. We need to sell everything--mostly antiques and salvaged stuff from old house. They are all nice things--furniture, antiques, ephemera, etc. I've tried contacting some antiques shops, auction houses in the area, but everyone seems to only deal in small items....

Both sisters are so 'busy' with their lives that they have little time to commit to moving this along. It's been years of this bullshit and I am fed up. Need help!

I have time this summer/fall to go there and stay in the area for maybe a week and work on this project.

Any Advice people?

1kjurcv,My sister and I don’t get along- help,FewDoctor3224,"Hey, I’m 21 and my sister is 18. We used to be on decent terms before Covid, but ever since then, it feels like everything’s gone downhill. Her attitude towards me has completely shifted, it’s almost impossible to have a normal conversation without her snapping or raising her voice. I get that this phase of life is tough, sorting out uni, figuring out who you are, all of that. I’ve been through it too, so I try to cut her some slack.

We both moved countries a few years ago and had to start from scratch with no friends or familiarity, so in the beginning, we leaned on each other a bit. But as soon as she started getting the hang of things and found her own rhythm, it’s like she flipped a switch and became super bitter towards me. I’ve tried to bridge the gap, I offer to hang out, drive her places, get food together, vibe to songs in the car, crack jokes to lighten the mood, basically, just trying to connect. But it gets really exhausting, especially because I constantly have to filter everything I say. Even the smallest thing she doesn’t like will set her off, and suddenly she’s yelling again.

It also feels pretty one-sided. She’s never introduced me to her friends, even though she knows mine. I know that might sound petty, but when small things like that keep adding up, it starts to really sting.

Another layer to this is her health, she’s gained a lot of weight to the point that doctors were concerned and said she was borderline diabetic. When I try to motivate her to come to the gym or be active, she takes it as criticism and lashes out. On top of that, she manipulates situations with our parents and twists my words to make me look like the bad guy. I don’t even start the arguments, but yes, I do lose my temper after being constantly spoken to in that tone.

She doesn’t help around the house either. Anytime I ask her to do something, it’s met with a sigh or flat-out refusal. And if she does it, it’s with so much attitude that I wish I hadn’t asked in the first place.

It’s just lonely, honestly. We’re only four years apart, but we can’t even sit down and talk or just enjoy each other’s company. I’ve tried so hard, but nothing changes. If anyone’s ever dealt with a sibling dynamic like this, what advice would you give?",1,1,1746946034.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjurcv/my_sister_and_i_dont_get_along_help/
1kjszdh,I haven't talked to my dad in 6 months and I think he'll cut me off when I do,throwaway_687968,"I made a post on r/family back in December after my last phone call with my dad, but the short of it is: My parents divorced about 2/3 years ago now and both have new partners. My dad hates my mom's newer partner (for more than just being a new partner).

The last time we talked was in December before my birthday, and at the time I tried to convince him to attend my graduation, to which he eventually said ""If it's easiest, I won't go"". We literally haven't talked since then, but I know he's alive cuz he's still active on face book. It's not like it was a ""cut off"" conversation, he just hasn't called and I haven't either. Which I kind of regret now.

SO: due to various circumstances, my fiancé and I are moving in with my mom and her boyfriend (now fiancé). I definitely need to call or maybe write a letter? to tell my dad... but I don't really know what to say. I probably should call him since he does currently still pay for my phone plan and I need to get that separated and sorted and don't wanna do that without his knowledge, but I know if I ask, he'll wonder why and I don't want to lie.

I'm still pretty upset that my dad didn't call or send a card for my graduation. It's just been complete radio silence for 6 months...

Anyways, open to advice but I just kind of wanted to write this out cuz it sucks.

TLDR: Moving in with my mom and her BF who my dad hates, when I call my dad to tell him the bad news it'll be our first conversation in 6 months. ",2,2,1746938910.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjszdh/i_havent_talked_to_my_dad_in_6_months_and_i_think/

1kjs7v3,My mom got mad at me for wearing a tube top??,pinchependejaa,"Hi everyone, not sure where to post this since it’s my first time but here we go. I (23f) was wearing a tube top today bc it was literally 100 degrees and just hot overall, i get home with her from running errands and my younger sister is home upstairs with her boyfriend. 

I was in the kitchen having a small snack and my mom was outside with the dogs and I went out to see the sunset and looked for her about something else, she looks at me weird and says why didn’t i change my shirt i was like so confused why she even said that. For some info whenever my sisters boyfriend is here I can’t wear certain tops or clothes without my mom suggesting I change or we argue about it. 

I got mad at her and told her I don’t care if he’s here or not I should be able to wear what I want since I live here and that you’re weird for not letting me wear this shirt.

1kjs6lg,The woman I find hard calling my mother,Glittering-Rock6762,"It’s mother’s day tomorrow, she wants me to go eat dinner with my sister and I. I hate the idea of it. It makes me angry. She doesn’t deserve a “mothers day”

I’m still in highschool so i’m probably just in a phase like my dad says. She still abused me mentally, to the point where I would rather sleep outside in a winter jacket during October than stay at home with her. I don’t know why people just don’t get it. She tries to brush it off like nothing happens, and that it’s mother’s day tomorrow so nothing ever happened. 

She’s saying I’m ruining mother’s day. I’m causing her pain. 
What about the pain you caused me. Wasn’t only one day either, was it. 

I don’t know what to do… Do I go? Do I not? I still don’t want to hurt her too much.

1kjrtto,"My dad refuses to admit he and my mom were terrible parents, and now he wants to cut me off",melimel667,"Hi everyone,
I’d really appreciate some advice.

Context: My mom comes from a family with a long history of mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.) and was always labeled as ""crazy."" My dad is an alcoholic and can be extremely uncaring — like refusing to pick me up from the hospital after surgery when I was a kid, not going to my sister’s college graduation, and even trying to give my other sister up for adoption because she was a troubled teenager.

They made sure we were fed, clothed, celebrated our birthdays, hugged us, and told us they loved us. But they also beat us, screamed constantly, and fought with each other all the time.

Their fights were terrifying when I was little. I remember my mom screaming she was going to kill my dad, and him handing her a knife and daring her to do it. Or her pouring gasoline on him while he slept drunk and saying she was going to set him on fire. My sisters and I would cry and beg them not to hurt each other.

When I was around 8 or 9, I started stepping in to stop the fights. Usually, my dad being drunk triggered them, so I’d wait for him to get home and quietly take care of him so my mom wouldn’t wake up and start screaming. Eventually, it became normal — she’d even send me to deal with him. This is just a glimpse of what we went through. I could fill pages with stories like these.

Why am I telling you all this? Because my sisters and I grew up completely messed up. And my dad refuses to acknowledge any of it.

I’m 24 now. When we were younger and struggling badly with our mental health, we went through a phase of saying “this is all your fault.” (And it was). My dad used to ignore it, but now that we’re older, he says we’re “disrespectful liars” who treat him and my mom like they’re monsters. He even agrees that the things we say — if they were true — would make them terrible parents. But he just refuses to believe or admit that they actually did those things.

We had a big fight recently, and he said we shouldn’t talk to him anymore if we think he’s so horrible. It’s not the first time he’s said that. Usually, I just act like nothing happened after a while, and he goes back to acting normal too. But I know my dad. If I don’t take the initiative to fix things this time, he really won’t talk to me again.

I’m tired. This is making me sick — emotionally and mentally. I’m already struggling, even though I’m doing better than I was as a child. I still love him, despite everything, and I don’t want to cut him off. But his refusal to admit what he did — and how cruel he could be — is breaking me.

What should I do?

A bit about my mom: We managed to convince her to see a psychiatrist when I was about 15. After starting medication, she slowly got better. Over time, she began to realize how wrong her actions were. She’s very remorseful now. She still causes drama sometimes and occasionally says things like, “That’s in the past, I don’t know why you and your sister still cry about it,” but overall she’s a hundred times better than she used to be.

And just to clarify: the reason all of this keeps coming up is because my sisters and I still struggle deeply with mental health issues. We’re trying to build a healthy mindset now, but we were never taught one. It’s like building something from scratch. We’re quick to anger like our mom (I’m never physically aggressive — I hate aggression, it makes me anxious — but my older sister is), we yell when upset, we struggle with keeping our homes clean just like our parents did. We grew up in a pretty dirty house, and those habits are hard to unlearn.

I don't know what to do because I love them very much, but I don't think I'll ever be able to get better around them.

I'm a woman by the way",8,2,1746934735.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjrtto/my_dad_refuses_to_admit_he_and_my_mom_were/
1kjrt9p,I want my mommy,RandomStranger0109,"It’s Mother’s Day tomorrow. She’s still here with us. But she’s not really here for me, not really has been. 

I try to relate to people who have good relationships with their moms, but I never got it. I try to love her purely, but I remember how many times she hurt me, and she does it again ,and again. She wasn’t really there for 7 years of my life because of school, work, and it was after her divorce, so I lived with my grandparents. She visited often. I don’t remember what we did. She then started taking me to my step dads. He’s okay. She worked nights so most of the time I was just in my room on my iPad and eating junk food as my meals as she slept. Some days we’d go out. But not often. I always wanted to go to the park, but we never really did because she was tired. I don’t remember going out with her at all anymore, only very vague things about the same few moments. 

After my brother, it’s like I hardly talk to her. He’s a baby, I know he needs it. It’s been a few years, and the only thing I get from my mom is a look or a few sentences. Some days it’s nothing at all. Only she really just buys me things and calls it a day and says it’s her love to me. 

It’s Mother’s Day tomorrow and I’m thinking of her. But I’m not thinking of the past, I’m crying in my bed thinking of moments where she could’ve and should’ve been by my side. I think of a world where right now she’s brushing my hair and telling me she loves me. I think of a world where we had a girls day and we talked about girly things. I think about a world where I can proudly say I have a beautiful relationship with my mother. I think about her, giving me hugs and kisses and telling me I will always be her lovely daughter. A world where I tell her I love her because she’s my mom and I admire her. It won’t happen. Because a lot of these things, are just fiction in my mind. But that won’t happen unless I beg for it. And what kind of love is that? 

So I stay silent. Watching my brother get the love I wish I could’ve had. I see him go to the park with her almost everyday. They go to the arcade almost every month. She dresses him up and gives him parties. They go to all the theme parks with him. I never got that. I’m glad for my brother that he gets that. But a pang of jealousy hits me every second, wishing I got that too. I just want to feel like my mom loves me. I want to have that feeling that I know she’s with me every second. I want to love her like she’s done all these things for me. But I won’t. Like I said, most of them were just me hoping she did. 

TL:DR; Mom didn’t really give me that much attention. It’s Mother’s Day, and I’m mourning what she could’ve been to me. ",5,2,1746934683.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjrt9p/i_want_my_mommy/

1kjr2nk,im so sick of my brother trying to sneak a peek under my clothes🤦‍♀️,Several_Snow6577,"This has occurred before numerous times. AND. IM. SO. SICK. OF .IT. 

I was sleeping on the sofa from a tiresome night of doing my assignment. Then suddenly, I woke up from my sleep and saw my brother trying to pull my dress up gently to peek at my underwear. Bro tried to be sleek when he was caught by trying to walk away, and initiating a normal conversation with my mother 😭. Of course I went to my mother and informed her about what have transpired. When asked if he did it, this bish actually said ""no."" 

I CAUGHT YOU RED HANDED, WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO!? 

And take note guys, I already told my mom before about what he have done, so she's aware of what he's doing. However, Im so infuriated and disappointed when my mother brushed it off. She told me that I was ""burara"" or messy or careless (i dont know how to translate this in english better) and that she already told me to eat (expressing that it wouldnt have occurred if I have just woken up and eaten), to which I argued back that she should be angry at my brother and not at me because I was not the one doing what is WRONG. And then it became quiet, my mother resumed to what she was watching on the phone and my brother went to the sofa by doing his usual thing on his phone. I was confused. Thats all? Are we just going to ignore what happened? 

Im devastated because Im literally having the worst day of my life. I hate this year. Im sleep deprived, im depressed from my studies, Im menstruating, and im too tired of this happening again and again. 

My mother have defended my brother before. And she would always paint me to be the wrong because, simply, my brother has autism, and she thinks his wrong actions were done from pure, childish, and innocent curiosity 🤦‍♀️. When clearly he knows that it is wrong because he wouldnt done it sneekily or secretly if he think it is an innocent action. 

I really dont know what to do guys. My mother wont do anything about it. Im tired of always being cautious on changing my clothes, taking a bath, sitting comfortably, and sleeping peacefully without a certain some trying to invade my space without my consent.

Feel like talking to a brick wall and it’s hurts.,CaramelTruffle_79624,"The other night I was calmly telling my mother again to not do something with my things unless she asks me or tells me she’s doing it. This has been a thing since I was a kid. I then went to my own space in the house and let out some screams to release my frustration and not being heard and repeatedly disrespected in this small way. I guess my screaming to release my frustrations (in my private space and alone) triggered my dad because then he proceeded to come at me and get in my face like I was some guy in a bar wanting to start a fight. He stood in front of me and went crazy. Yelling in my face as close as I let him get and screaming in my ear. I stood there with a hand up in his face to try and create some space and my face turned away. Just waiting for him to be done. He was also flickering the lights and grabbing things and banging them (my book shelf). He then called me a name (won’t say it here incase it’s not allowed) as if I wasn’t his daughter. Like I was some random women. When he was initially yelling at me to shut up I lost it because I’m tired of being the quiet one who takes sh!T just to keep the peace. I was at my breaking point but was dealing with it in private at the start. I very rarley yell and get mad but lately these patterns have been getting to me more. I still never usually get this mad. Today I lost my voice because of the whole thing and my dad and I aren’t talking. I feel like this is all my fault and I feel the urge to fix this and apologize but I know I won’t get the same back. If I even show any amount of emotion other than happy, calm or quiet I get told to stop or shut up or yelled at. All this would not happen if I could just move out but I can’t yet. I feel stuck and like my dad hates me. We were just in the same room for the first time since. I didn’t look at him and just kept doing what I was doing. I saw him from the corner of my eye stare at me like he was still trying to intimidate me or glare at me like I’m a guy he wants to fight at a bar or something. Idk what to do anymore.

1kji543,Mother’s Day…It’s More Than Once a Year!,Big-Musician5982,"# Mother’s Day…It’s More Than Once a Year!

Is your mother still living?  What about your grandmother(s)?

You are truly blessed if your mother and/or grandmothers are alive!  Be grateful, spend time with them, and take advantage of having them in your life!

My mother and father and all my grandparents have all passed away, but I miss them all. I often think about them and wish I could talk with them one more time. I have regrets for not calling or visiting more often while they were still around. Spend as much time as you can with your parents and grandparents while you can! 

If your mother and grandmother are living, how often do you talk or visit with them?  Just on Mother’s Day?  On holidays?  Monthly?  When you need a babysitter or need them for something?   Ponder that for a minute and ask yourself, “Why don’t I talk to them or visit more often?”  “What can I do to make a change?” 

For most young adults, mothers and grandmothers are simply overlooked in the business of life. It is not that you don’t love them.  It’s that so many other things vie for your attention. But, you can do better. How long does it take to make a call or send a text?  Are you really too busy?

Sometimes, people think of their mothers as busybodies who may “rub them the wrong way.” Some resent their advice and incessant questions. There may be a small blowup that has created a big rift that has caused friction. Some people may have mothers that have wronged them in a major way. 

There may be legitimate reasons for a strained relationship, but that can change. Forgiveness is a powerful force that mends relationships. You can take the initiative and be the one to start the process of developing a closer relationship.

This Mother’s Day, make a conscious decision to change the way you relate to your mother and grandmother(s) …all year long. You can do better, and you should. Make more frequent calls and visits on a regular basis.  Make sure to let them know you love them and appreciate all they have done for you. 

There is so much history between you and it feels good to talk about it. Remind them of special childhood memories you treasure. Recount special events, trips, and time spent together.  

Mothers and grandmothers know more than you would like to admit. Ask them for their opinions. Tell them what your children are doing in their lives and see what they think. Find out why decisions were made to relocate, change jobs or other questions about your childhood.  Ask them now, while they are still around to fill in some gaps and questions you may have.

Your mother, mother-in-law, and grandmothers certainly care about you and would love to hear from you.  Set reminders on your phone or calendar if you have trouble remembering to contact them.  Make it a new priority to show them that you are thinking about them and value them.

These special women in your life may not be around for the next Mother’s Day, so let them know now that you love them. Make it a new priority to show them that you are thinking about them and value them. Yes, you will miss them when they are gone, but make sure you don’t have regrets for not calling them or visiting them more often while you still can! ",1,1,1746905048.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kji543/mothers_dayits_more_than_once_a_year/

How do you get your kids to clean up after themselves.  
Im mentally exhausted from having to pick up or chase up stuff pretty much every day.  
He's 14 . He takes forever to do anything and everything. Guaranteed any time he's supposed to do something,he needs to go to the loo and is gone for ages . 
He does routinely put the dishes away ,with only needing reminding once or twice a week ( even though it is his job everyday ) he still needs reminding about the cat litter too frequently, considering sometimes it absolutely stinks out the house  and "" he didn't notice"" . We have had the cats almost 2 years. .its supposed to be a 50/50 job but I got fed up of chasing him and just left him to weekends....yet he still needs telling. 
I can say to do something this way ,that way, do it ,don't do , and he will know better and not listen ,usually resulting in injury /something broken / dropped etc . 

Im exhausted emotionally from having to go on and on and on about things not being done , when I know it would be quicker and less hassle to just do it myself . It's not that he can't do things,  like wipe the work top after making a drink or grating cheese,  it's that he ""can't see it "" .he can't see that puddle of liquid right by where he over poured his drink.
He can't see the cheese scattered across the floor and work top from the night before ,where he had already not seen it . 

I just don't know how to get it through to him that I'm absolutely sick of it and I'm not his slave . 
I've made plenty of jokes ,sent plenty of memes . Pointed out plenty of scenarios and had a go at him plenty of times.  He knows what is expected . I've even given myself a week off and left every thing to him a few times ,and he still doesn't get it ? 
I've gone on strike with telling him to pick up his clothes from the bathroom floor before now , he just kept adding more .until eventually i couldn't take it and snapped . 
""What clothes ?"" Was the reply . . . The bleeping clothes you are literally stood on top of thisbvery second. Was my final straw response. 

Luckily he isn't as bad for leaving clothes in the bathroom these days . But it just shows that leaving it all and seeing when his "" oh wow ,i need to tidy"" meter kicks in ,isn't a plan that will go well. 

Why don't they ( men in my experience  could be different for others )
Realise that it's more exhausting to keep going on about it than actually doing it.
That if there wasn't something to be moaning about ,there would be no moaning ,so in that case...there's obviously a problem if I'm moaning about it.  

Im just at my wits end now.
Im depressed as it is and this just isn't helping. This is possibly contributing towards it .

I've said if they were a partner I would have thrown them out by now because of them not pulling their weight. 
A flat mate I would have moved out from.  A guest staying for a while that I'd never speak to again because of how disrespectful it is ,leaving it all to me. . . So why should he be treated any differently ,why should he get to treat me like that.  He said he shouldn't,  but I can guarantee as soon as I walk in to that kitchen,there will be mess ....

Im avoiding it till Monday.  I've gone on strike and refusing to cook or do dishes for the weekend .


Just wanted to add. He does keep hos bed room tidy and does so quite independently, the only issue with that is he will start to tidy his bedroom and not do his other tasks ,like putting dishes away or the cat tray . Then we have a conflict as to me ,the household chores are more important than his room being tidied.  So I want it done -now- , not in 3 hours when the 20 minutes worth of mess has finally been done , usually I need him to get things done so I can do my things.  Like put away the dishes so I can wash the others to put on the drainer.  Do the litter so I can brush the floor.",5,13,1746901390.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjgsq7/how_do_you_do_it/
1kjfzsq,Why my family treats me as a hero when difficulties and as a monster when life is good?,One_Possession6852,"Hey

So Im a 35 years old male and I have been thinking for many years why my parents and siblings treat me as a hero when there is some difficulties in life and when everything is fine Im like totally monster?

For example the latest is that I took my mother to live with me because in her apartment is water damage and they have to fix it for three months. Some weeks ago she panicked that where she could go so I gave the solution. Now two days ago my brother called her that his family is coming over for some party. I told her that its ok but I go to my fathers place because I have to sleep because I work the night shift. At that second she started to treat me like Im the biggest monster and now she is mad at my place.

This exact same happened one year ago when I bought her supplies to fix her apartment for 1000e because she had no money. One week after I was the biggest asshole because I didnt take part of some party.

This has been going on my whole life. And I cannot wrap my head around it.",8,7,1746899276.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjfzsq/why_my_family_treats_me_as_a_hero_when/

I would try to mix my words up and say things that would not get them under my radar. Although, there are times where I think I can release my inhibitions and just express the way I like things to be expressed but there's a matter of suppression I have to get aware of because there are constantly judging. Whenever I would explicitly express these things because I felt this growing urgency to feel proud and spread the proudness or joy, there would be a reckless denial to feel that proudness. So, I've been teaching myself to keep these things to myself and to congratulate things silently. 

Of course, there were wretched times where I would be met with silence or change of topic or get challenged or argumentative for zero reason. That's why those dynamics I am trying to change and only accept what's possible with them. Finding validation from family can be helpful, especially, if the timing is genuine.

1kjfoq4,am i overreacting?,qtqtqtqt111,"I’m (18F) and i currently live with both of my parents. my older brother recently moved out after getting engaged to his girlfriend last year. 

idk how to articulate this well but i’ll try my best. anyway here’s my problem. 
every time im out with my dad he makes me regret going out and spending time with him because every single time i spend with both of my parents either one of them always starts a fight with me and they start insulting me. they always point out my mistakes genuinely EVERY SINGLE TIME im with them. and that’s why i started feeling more distant with them. 

they’re never physically abusive although there have been instances where they got physical, it was never really anything serious even if it mentally really hurt me. 

for the first time in my life today, i lost my bracelet that was real silver + it was from a set that my dad had bought for me as a gift. i’m not someone who often loses things like this let alone my jewelry but i got unlucky today, and i only noticed when i was back home so when me and my dad went back to the same stores i was at with my mom earlier today, i had asked him if i could go to the cinema tomorrow but the city i wanted to go to the cinema to was about 50 minutes from where we live so i asked if i could go with my brother and he suddenly said no and said the reason was that since his grandpa passed away recently i should stay home and help my mom because lost of guests MIGHT come over.

 {now a little backstory: we’re turkish but we live in germany, so i don’t know every close relative and for instance i probably only saw his grandpa who passed away only once in my life.} 

so that’s why i told him that i don’t understand why i can’t go because i wasn’t even close with that great-grandpa and that i only probably saw him once in my life and that’s why it didn’t really matter to me. i a really cold person when it comes to stuff like this because if i don’t have any attachments to a person i can’t really care about them if they pass away or if something happens to them- because i don’t/didn’t know them. 

and than suddenly he started calling me selfish and that im always like this only thinking about my self and my own comfort and immediately started talking about the mistake i made a few weeks ago
 (i can tell you if you want, it would make more sense then but it will be a lot longer than it alr is so i decided not to write it) 

and so i told him my reasoning as to why i did what i did but my dad is the type of person that whatever HE thinks is true, that’s the truth (even if it doesn’t directly involve him and he was a bystander) and other factors don’t matter to him. this type of thing happens every time that i now can’t even spend more than 30 minutes with him without arguing because our personalities are just polar opposites.

im terribly sorry for the super long text but i genuinely don’t know who to ask for help

1kjcfxr,I really hope someone can help me because I’m so lost.,Ragghodd,"
My parents are divorced. My dad moved on, got married, and lives like life handed him everything on a silver platter. My mom, on the other hand, works so hard and gives everything she’s got. She does have a boyfriend who helps her out financially — honestly, most of the time he’s the one covering things. That’s just the start of the mess.

My relationship with my dad is a disaster. I won’t completely trash him — maybe he was like 25% of a father to me. The rest? He was horrible. He ruined my life, stopped me from traveling, destroyed every opportunity that could’ve led me down a different path. After the divorce, I completely cut him off. I blocked him everywhere, and I don’t want to see him again. Part of it is how he treated me, and part of it is what he did to my mom — he used to be abusive.

My siblings say he’s changed since the divorce and that he wants to see me, but they told him not to try, because I wouldn’t respond. And honestly, I don’t care if he changed. I’m 18 now. It’s too late.

Now onto my mom — she’s the confusing part. Sometimes she’s full of love, and other times she completely loses it. She screams, threatens us, sometimes even tells us to go live with our dad (even though she fought him in court and gave up everything just to keep us). She cries, shuts down, and always expects some huge reward for her sacrifices. She always wants the best from us, and when we fail, she can’t handle it. She just… loses her mind and becomes someone else entirely.

I love my mom, but most of the time I can’t stand living with her. She’s supportive and damaging at the same time. She’s a victim, but she throws all her stress on us. This way of living is messing me up. I feel it deep, and I’m seriously thinking about running away after graduation — moving to another country. I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers, full of sadness and a dead end.

But at the same time, my mom is terrified of us leaving her. She always says she’s scared we’ll forget everything she did for us and just leave her for our dad. That guilt eats me up. I feel like I don’t want either of them, and then I feel horrible for thinking that — because my mom really did sacrifice so much.

I just want someone to help me understand all this. I’m writing this while crying my eyes out.",1,2,1746889661.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kjcfxr/i_really_hope_someone_can_help_me_because_im_so/

I told her I was upset, but instead of listening, she argued with me and never even apologized. She just said, “Stop being sad about every little detail.”

I told her, “You don’t show me love the way I show it to you. I give you so much of my heart, and I get nothing in return. You never make time for me, you never talk to me even when I try, and when I do, you take it as a joke or ignore it.”

I gave her an example: my aunt’s son, Amr, calls her every day to tell her how he feels. She gives him her time, laughs with him, listens, and gives advice — even if she sometimes seems tired of it. At least she *tries* with him. Why can’t my own mom do that for *me*, her daughter? I should matter. I should be a priority. Even when she’s mad or busy, my mental health should matter more.

She responded by saying, “You’re my daughter, I should feel comfortable around you and talk to you whenever.” But the reality is, she doesn’t. She barely talks to me.

1kjag4w,Mother’s Day…It’s More Than Once a Year!,Big-Musician5982,"Is your mother still living?  What about your grandmother(s)?

You are truly blessed if your mother and/or grandmothers are alive!  Be grateful, spend time with them, and take advantage of having them in your life!

My mother and father and all my grandparents have all passed away, but I miss them all. I often think about them and wish I could talk with them one more time. I have regrets for not calling or visiting more often while they were still around. Spend as much time as you can with your parents and grandparents while you can! 

If your mother and grandmother are living, how often do you talk or visit with them?  Just on Mother’s Day?  On holidays?  Monthly?  When you need a baby sitter or need them for something?   Ponder that for a minute and ask yourself, “Why don’t I talk to them or visit more often?”  “What can I do to make a change?” 

For most young adults, mothers and grandmothers are simply overlooked in the business of life. It is not that you don’t love them.  It’s that so many other things vie for your attention. But, you can do better. How long does it take to make a call or send a text?  Are you really too busy?

Sometimes, people think of their mothers as busybodies who may “rub them the wrong way.” Some resent their advice and incessant questions. There may be a small blowup that has created a big rift that has caused friction. Some people may have mothers that have wronged them in a major way. 

There may be legitimate reasons for a strained relationship, but that can change. Forgiveness is a powerful force that mends relationships. You can take the initiative and be the one to start the process of developing a closer relationship.   


This Mother’s Day, make a conscious decision to change the way you relate to your mother and grandmother(s) …all year long. You can do better, and you should. Make more frequent calls and visits on a regular basis.  Make sure to let them know you love them and appreciate all they have done for you. 

There is so much history between you and it feels good to talk about it. Remind them of special childhood memories you treasure. Recount special events, trips, and time spent together.  

Mothers and grandmothers know more than you would like to admit. Ask them for their opinions. Tell them what your children are doing in their lives and see what they think. Find out why decisions were made to relocate, change jobs or other questions about your childhood.  Ask them now, while they are still around to fill in some gaps and questions you may have.

Your mother, mother-in-law, and grandmothers certainly care about you and would love to hear from you.  Set reminders on your phone or calendar if you have trouble remembering to contact them.  Make it a new priority to show them that you are thinking about them and value them.

These special women in your life may not be around for the next Mother’s Day, so let them know now that you love them. Make it a new priority to show them that you are thinking about them and value them. Yes, you will miss them when they are gone, but make sure you don’t have regrets for not calling them or visiting them more often while you still can!

1kj4tfv,Toxic family,Weak-Housing-5943,"( 26 f)My family are destroying my mental health! I have a big family but I’m not close with any of them. I have 8 brothers & sisters but only grew up with my two real brothers and my mum as my dad doesn’t really bother with us & he used to be abusive to my mum! No one else from my dad’s side bothers and the same with my mums side so it’s really just my mum and two older brothers 33&35. 

I’ll start with my mum 😅growing up my mum has always had different boyfriends and would make me go stay with them on weekends or have her random friends I don’t know look after me while she would visit her boyfriends. She’s never really been very motherly and she’s always moaning and bitching about 1 child over something. I’ve not really noticed until now I’m 26 and my mum never shows us any affection such as hug us, ask if we are okay, how are day was or even that she loves us and i just thought this was normal until i seen how my boyfriends family treats him. Birthdays are never really celebrated such as I’ve had 1 birthday meal with my mum two brothers and auntie (it was my 18th & my auntie arranged it) I dread Christmas as it’s just awkward because we’re not a close family and it feels forced. 

My older brother (ill call him Steve 35) is VERY aggressive and he intimidates me as he would always be kicking off when he lived at home such as smashing the house up, shouting abuse at me & my mum. He says the worst things such as he’s told my mum I hope she dies, he’s gonna beat her boyfriends up and he’s even threatened me saying he’s gonna hit me and hit my boyfriend. He’s just a hot head and he goes mad over the smallest things and still brings up past trauma and says he is the way he is because of my mum. (My mums kicked him Out multiple times and he’s lived with my dad who is an alcoholic and abuses women. He’s also lived in hostels) 

My other brother (I’ll call him mark 33) he’s a lot calmer than Steve and he’s more of a jokester but still has a bad side to him. He’s never had a Job and he’s always sold drugs like Steve, he’s never had his own place and just lives with girlfriends or on my mums Sofa. As much as he’s not as bad as Steve he can still be aggressive (but its mainly just with me) for example I made some boiled eggs in the morning for breakfast and he was on the sofa and he shouted “shut the fucking kitchen door” as I walked past him to go back into my room and eat my eggs he said to this random girl he was talking to that he’s gonna smash my face in and I’m really pissing him off (I have no idea why I’m annoying him we barely speak) also my mum NEVER defends me when my brothers are mean to me! 

But recently ive been going through a really bad time at the moment as i had my phone hacked and videos of me and my bf where leaked to people I know and I was harassed for a few weeks for money. I became really anxious to walk to work or the shops in case something would happen as my blackmailer knew where I lived.

 My mum didn’t really want me saying anything around her now ex bf because she didn’t want to cause a scene and my older brother Steve called me a slag and said I was over reacting and because I lost it and told him to fuck off (I never swear at my family) he threatens to hit me and smash my room up while my mum is stood there saying nothing! Mark tbf seemed kinda worried & would ask me if the police have found anything yet (even tho I wasn’t allowed the police to come to the house because there’s “stuff” hidden in the house) Luckily I have a very supportive boyfriend because my family aren’t the best but i decided to just stop talking to mark as him being so aggressive when I’m going through a bad time really got to me! I stopped talking to my mum about 2 weeks after because she made a comment about knowing I was upset but didn’t say anything because her now ex boyfriend was in the house. Fast forward it’s been 6 months since I’ve spoken to my older brother Steve and about 3 months since I’ve spoken to my mum. 

During this time my mum has constantly sighed walking past me or my room. Gets up in the mornings & is loud on purpose, picks and chooses when she’s making me tea but when she doesn’t she will let me know as late as possible like 7pm. She has spoken to me once but it was very rude she just started shouting asking what my problem was and that I’m being hostile and she’s done nothing wrong and I make the atmosphere in the house negative. I don’t like confrontation so I just tried my hardest not to cry because I felt abit embarrassed that it was in front of my bf and I knew if I said something then it would kick off. So i waited until she cooled down and sent her a text while she was at work (it wasn’t rude it was just explaining that I’m going through a hard time and she’s not supportive) she read it and ignored it. My mums heard me on the phone to the police and not once asked me about the case or if I’m okay! 

The other week I was away for my boyfriend’s birthday and we come back the day of his birthday in the evening and my mum and brother kicked off because they accused me of breaking the washing machines even tho my boyfriend explained that I didn’t! As soon as my boyfriend walks upstairs my brother says pay for it or move out and I just lost it and told him to get fucked so my mum comes upstairs saying I was out of order for saying that and I need to pay for it then I started crying and this just made her more angry and said why am i crying and I’m immature. Mark just kept laughing calling me a baby. So know I’m not talking to my mum or two brother and my anxiety is crazy and even going down stairs is hard! I just stay in my room but I can hear them bitch about me. I just feel hopeless because I just want a loving family.",2,3,1746862849.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kj4tfv/toxic_family/

1kj3lgw,The Childhood Divide: Why I Lost Touch with My Paternal Half-Sister,Armios-San,"When I was a child (10-12 years old), I was living with my father. This was because my parents were divorced or separated. My father was married to another woman at the time, and they had my half-sister, the one I'm referring to now. I lived with her from when she was a baby until she was 3 years old.

Then, my mother decided it was time to get me back, through legal means and so on. I was separated from my sister at that time, and we've remained separated until this day; I am now 19 years old. As far as I remember, my sister is currently between 8-9 years old at the time of this post.

Communication with my father is completely cut off currently, and I have no way to contact him or my sister due to personal reasons. I have always wished I had a sister (for personal reasons). Whenever I think as an adult that if I had a sister and we lived together, my life would have completely changed and become very different for the better.

I have a brother who is almost the same age as me, and we live together, but he doesn't have any of the qualities I wish for. He is completely different, and I don't feel anything towards him, except for some basic care simply because he is my brother.

Anyway, I believe that communication with my half-sister is largely possible. But the question here is: How will I build a strong relationship with her, one based on emotional bonds, trust, shared interests, and love? And how will she accept me as a brother whom she hasn't truly known for many years?

Also, I lack social skills and suffer from several mental health challenges. That's why I'm writing this. I am open to opinions and perspectives!",5,2,1746857824.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kj3lgw/the_childhood_divide_why_i_lost_touch_with_my/
1kj1cz9,Actually having to cope and see that person that chose to not have you in their life? I don't know how to look at him without just bawling. (ambiguous grief),Kallyfromthevalley,"My grandfather, who was my very best friend for majority of my childhood/early adult years remarried after my grandmother passed and basically had to choose between me or the wife.

It’s been almost 2 years of asking myself why it has to be this way, as he is still alive, and can call me if he wanted to. It’s so so so painful to know he chooses not to care about anything about my life, talks to my brothers with no issue. Turns out i have to see him at a family ceremony next month. Any thought of him truly just makes me automatically start bawling (i’m sure yall know what i mean).

I can’t imagine having to be in a room, look him in the eye, and not automatically start bawling my eyes out due to the pain of it all.

Has anyone been in this weird type of situation? Any advice or words of wisdom you would recommend? I’m not afraid to see him, but i’ve spent so long healing and moving on from this. And now i have to let all of the memories come flooding back when i have to look at him in person.

1kj0rlh,"Should i accept my moms ""gifts""?",alejaev123,"I have found through my experiences, books and therapy that my moms way of affection is through objects/food/gifts, anything she can buy and give. 
After finding out a couple of things she did through my life (that i now realize messed me up a lot) i was/am incredibly disgusted, became very distant, and sometimes im very mean to her. I feel like she took this as a kind or threat, and now shes been incredibly mean to me and makes a huge scene from time to time. On the last one, she told me that having kids was shit, and that i was not useful to her in any way, and she didnt even let me speak at the end and after she pretended everything was normal. After all that, she probably regretted it, cause she started buying me things i need, desserts and foods i like, etc, and im rejecting them by not eating anything she brings me or declining her invitations.
My psychologist is trying to help me with this, and told me to do an exercise where i list the things mi mom can give me, as in love, emotional stuff, etc, and i wrote her gifts as her way of ""love"" or ""apology"". She told me that, as a start, i can accept the things she offers that i want to take, but im still conflicted with that. I dont want to accept her gifts because she might think that means i forgive her for the stuff that happened and the things she said to me. I dont want to forgive that or make her feel better, because things like that happen whenever she feels bad (she takes it out on me), and im sure thats gonna happen again and keep happening.
So what do you think i should do?

Tldr: i became distant with my mom, then she told me having me was shit, then to apologize she started giving me gifts that i have not accepted. Giving stuff is and has always been her way of ""loving"", but I dont know if accepting those things is like accepting an apology when i dont want to.

I (22F) still live with my parents. I have bought everything on my own since I was 15 but as of now they pay for my insurance and phone. Either of my brothers (25 & 17) have bought anything on their own as my parents gave them everything growing up. Every argument I got into with my dad as a teen was about money. I have always been the black sheep of the family and they treat me soooo differently than my brothers. Even my other family members have said how my parents treat me differently. I have a job, pay for all my trips on my own (which is frequent since I go to disney once a month). My parents have decided to charge me rent which is only $200 and not bad. I’m very privileged as I know it could be a lot worse. But what hurts me the most is that my parents don’t need my money. They make $200,000 annually. My mom get her nails and hair done regularly. My dad is an addict who will not go without and would do anything to get beer or chew. They donate money to organizations in our town. We have a house cleaner that comes once a week to do some light cleaning and I told my mom that she is a waste of money as she doesn’t do anything (this past week she didn’t even wipe down the bathroom mirror).

1kj05pv,"[27M] My sister [25F] is cold and dismissive toward me, and I don’t understand why. How should I handle this?",dzonibravo,"I’m [27M] and my sister is [25F]. We used to have a normal relationship, but for the past few years, she’s been very distant, cold, and often treats me with disrespect. She says it’s because of a period in my past when I had personal issues (I was dealing with depression and some financial instability), but we never had a direct conflict, and I never said or did anything hurtful to her personally.  

Recently, I spent two months in Germany helping our older sister who just had a baby. Our younger sister refused to visit, saying she didn’t want to be in the same space as me. She also made a hurtful comment to our sister: *“Why should I come just to babysit your kids?”* That made me feel like I was just an excuse, and she didn’t want to help in the first place.  

She acts very dismissive toward me, even in small situations—for example, when I needed a place to rest during a protest, I stayed at her boyfriend’s lab and she didn’t even bring me a pillow, despite living nearby. She often ignores my messages, gives me one-word answers, and sometimes makes passive-aggressive remarks about my past struggles.  

I’ve tried asking her calmly why she’s upset with me, but she just says *“You know why”* without explaining. Our older sister thinks she’s being unfair but doesn’t want to get involved. My parents say *“That’s just how she is”* and avoid the topic.  

I’ve always tried to keep the peace and never treated her badly. I’m starting to feel like she sees me as less than her, and it honestly hurts. I don’t know if I’m missing something or if she’s just holding onto resentment.  

**How should I approach this?**  
- Should I push for a direct conversation, even if she avoids it?  
- Is it worth involving family to mediate, or would that make things worse?  
- Or should I just accept the distance and let go of expectations?  

Honestly, I’m tired of this dynamic. I’ve been patient, but I don’t know if I should confront her, seek family intervention, or just accept that she doesn’t want a relationship.

1kiznjt,Am I the crazy one? Do I need to get help? *long story*,CandleExpensive8881,"My brother constantly disregards my boundaries. Recently, I was studying in my study room when he came in and sat in my bedroom area, even after I asked him to leave over 20 times. He claimed that our mom told him to be there, but I was clearly uncomfortable and annoyed. I started lecturing him about his unrealistic goals—like wanting to be a cardiac surgeon along with other medical specialties—explaining that it would be mentally exhausting.

Then he started bringing up religion, saying that God has written down everything that will happen to us. He claimed I could still pass with high grades even without studying if it was meant to be. When I disagreed, he mocked me, accusing me of not believing in God. He stayed for about an hour, even as I argued with him, and I suspected he was recording me.

When my mom came to check on us, I asked them to leave, but she took it as me wanting her out too, and she sided with him. I got so frustrated that after they left, I went to his room, cursed him out, and started kicking the trash cans and throwing his clothes on the floor. He recorded me again and then pushed me to the ground. When I broke down and said that my mom always takes his side, he just laughed. I tried telling him how much his actions hurt me, but he admitted he doesn’t feel guilty at all. It hurt to hear that because I realized he really doesn’t care.

It’s not just this incident—there’s a pattern of him never feeling bad for anything, even when our pets died. I’m just exhausted and overwhelmed from constantly dealing with his behavior, especially when it feels like my mom always takes his side.

It has always been a sensitive topic for me when I see my mother taking his side my anger just explodes. I know I need to control my anger and just deal with it. But why can't he just respect my decision? He says very mean things to me even regarding my journey to medical world. He thinks I don't deserve it. Many many things.

1kiyftg,Mother’s Day as a New Mom,Awkward_Promotion549,"So for some context I am a new mom as of 3 months ago and it is the first grandchild on both sides of the family. It’s wonderful that everyone is so excited and helpful but also at times overwhelming. I am also very much a people pleaser and have been having a lot of trouble getting comfortable setting boundaries for myself, saying no, and what I think is best for the baby. I went back to work this week and fortunately my mother-in-law is saving us by babysitting 3 days a week. Obviously so many benefits that the baby is with family/someone that loves her, saving money, and she’s wonderful with the baby. BUT it’s been a tough first week back at work. I’m having a lot of feelings come up of jealousy around my MIL getting so much time with the baby and frustrations that the schedule I created isn’t being followed. I keep getting worried the baby is forgetting me and going to think my MIL is her mom. I am trying hard to control my feelings so that I don’t accidentally say anything I regret to her. 


Okay now to the point. I am worried about Mother’s Day and making my Mil feel excluded. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings but I also don’t want to make plans and then regret it and feel resentful (which I’ve been doing a lot lately). But honestly sometimes I’d rather sacrifice my good time than feel the guilt of hurting someone I care abouts feelings. my MIL watched the baby 3 days this week already and my husband and I made her a special Mother’s Day dinner tonight, Friday, with a special dessert and really thoughtful card. Sunday we are spending with my side of the family doing a brunch and walk. I was hoping to spend Saturday just my husband, the baby, and I so that we can get some just us time. However my MIL will be alone the rest of this weekend and I feel bad. I feel like we should make a plan to go on a walk or something with her. My husband says not to worry but clearly I am still worried about it. It’s like ping pong In my head between making another plan with her for the weekend so she doesn’t feel excluded/lonely or prioritizing myself and what I want for my first Mother’s Day weekend. 


Are my post partum hormones just crazy and I am totally overthinking this? Any advice/thoughts? ",1,3,1746839553.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kiyftg/mothers_day_as_a_new_mom/

1kivre2,Canceling My Sons 13th Birthday party,Hopeful_Bug_8572,"I have been growing more and more concerned with my son and fiancés relationship. For a little bit of back story, our son is not biologically my fiancés son. He has been raising him since he was 5 and always taken care of him. He has taken care of him just like he does all of our kids. He has supported our son playing sports, guitar lessons, drum sets, and even started him an IRA. However, when it comes to my son making mistakes, I feel my fiancé is too harsh. For a long time I have told myself I am just being an over protective mother and he needs a strong father in his life. The older he gets the harsher the I feel my fiancé is to our son. It feels like our son will make a dumb decision, like take a lighter from home and set off smoke bombs in the neighborhoods open field during a burn ban, and my husband looses it. Grounds him for a month. Any time my son gets below a B on Canvas, he is grounded. Not only until it is back above a B, but it has to be back at a B or better for a week before he is off grounding. Canvas changes daily and is not his final grade. Our son has made honor roll all year and just received notice that he will be inducted into the national junior honor society next week. 

Now to the canceling of his birthday. He will be 13 on Mothers day and he recently got in trouble at school so my husband wants to cancel his birthday all together. When I say in trouble I mean he was sent to the school library for ""Reset"" twice because he was being distracting and defiant in two of is six periods. Both teachers emailed me separately and both had a similar statement. ""This is not like him, but I had to send him to Reset"". I asked him when he got home why he was acting out today and he just continued to say he didn't know. Of course when my fiancé found out he was PO'd. He barely looked at our son that night and the first thing he said to me was that he doesn't deserve a birthday party and we are going to cancel it. I would like to point out that the general ""teen"" behaviors had been showing up more and more in the leading months. Heavy sighs, eye rolls, and hands going up saying ""what?"". But nothing outright disrespectful. 

I didn't agree to canceling his birthday but we still had not agreed on what to get our son for his birthday, so now my fiancé is using this to veto any idea I have thrown out for his big ticket 13th birthday gift. He just tells me that I clearly don't care about his opinion and am just going to do whatever I want anyways, so why do I keep asking about gift ideas. All because I didn't agree to canceling his birthday. For example, none of our kids have cell phones and our son is the oldest. I thought a flip phone would be a great gift for him. It was a hard no. He refuses to pay for the line and thinks he doesn't need to be texting his friends all the time. He also thinks he will loose it or break it and it will just p!ss my fiancé off. I suggested an E-Bike since that has been on his wish list for a year now. He said it will promote laziness. I suggested getting him a MP4 player because that was also on our sons wish list. Fiance said no, because he doesn't need to be sucked into a screen. I suggested getting an above ground pool that all 3 kids have been asking for. Then its a gift thats on his wish list, but not just for our son. Fiancé said no, because it will kill the grass and need to be cleaned (We have over an acre). It got to the point that he was bringing up the fact that in the past I complained about our kids having too much stuff. I explained that I was talking about little toys, dolls, barbies, nerf guns, and fidget toys. Not big items that they will only have 1 of. My last suggestions was not on our sons wish list, but he would love it and that is a crabbing boat trip. They are spendy but I thought then its an experience vs an item. I suggested we buy two tickets and my fiancé go with, because its well known I don't like boats or being on the water. My fiancé responded ""Would make more sense for you to go. I hate crab. You guys could eat it on the boat right out of the ocean.""

Is my fiancé being too harsh or am I being too soft?",50,66,1746831396.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kivre2/canceling_my_sons_13th_birthday_party/

1kisl2r,AITA For Declining Mothers Day Invitation?,,"Background - My grown divorced daughter with two school aged children with whom I have always had a wonderful relationship (we live just minutes from each other) remarried (quickly) to a man with no children who is himself an only child and very close to his parents. Right after they married, he made it clear his parents would be present at every single special event, birthday and holiday and that he and my daughter would host everything at their house. This irked me as I also enjoy doing holidays, etc., but have a larger family and can still do that at times when it works out for the other family members. Nothing hard and fast as we're sort of spread out in different cities. I can't even catch a break from his parents at my grandchildren's school concerts and activities. My main issue is knowing that if I want to see my family at Christmas or for my grandchildren's birthdays -or anything special -is always having to share this time with his parents present. I've gone from getting a lot of joy out of doing special things for and with my family to feeling like a lone observer. It's almost like he is installing his parents as the primary de facto grandparents. I did it for a year and toward the end of that year I was dreading each event more and more. It culminated in a Christmas that was complete stress. My grandchildren were bombed with presents to the extent they barely could show excitement over anything. There were duplicate gifts as my new son in law kept a 'master list' of which I was unaware. After Xmas morning gifts everyone was excused to their respective homes with instructions to return that evening for Christmas dinner. I spent the better part of Christmas Day with Advil and an ice pack for a lingering stress headache. After that, I said never again, and have been politely declining invitations including Easter and now Mother's Day. Thinking beyond myself, I've come to really believe that Mother's Day is for those younger women who are actively mothering! It's their day to hang out on the sofa and enjoy homemade gifts from kids and get a break from the kitchen. My daughter will probably not get that.

I have small arguments with my mom over the stupidest stuff like where she put the rest of my clothes when I searched all over the house and not letting her see some of my friends now whom I made recently out of embarrassment. I know I'm a piece of crap for son and human being. I don't want to make my mom more angrier than she already is since she is a very moody person just like my father. How do I change to become a better ""son""? Trying some self-reflecting just results in me being unsatisfied with the way I've been living and hate for myself.

1kis268,How can I live with disappointing my religious family?,growing_up_,"Hello Reddit,

I’m a 20-year-old university student, currently living alone in student housing about an hour away from my family. I’ve been living independently for a year and a half now. Since last October, I’ve been in a relationship with a wonderful boyfriend who is incredibly supportive, and I truly feel lucky to have him in my life.

I come from a Muslim background, and while I personally no longer believe in God, I still hold strong values and believe that if God does exist, He wouldn’t punish me for living a happy and fulfilling life, especially when I am constantly trying to be the best, kindest, and most honest version of myself.

My family knows about my boyfriend. My mother tolerates the relationship under the assumption that we aren’t doing anything that goes against religious values. That’s not the case, but I’ve chosen not to correct her because I don’t think it’s her business, and I don’t feel I’m doing anything wrong.

I want to move in with my boyfriend next year after I finish my bachelor’s degree. We already spend most of our time together, and the relationship is strong and loving. It feels like the natural next step. But I’m struggling with how to tell my family, especially knowing how it will likely be received.

I’ve lived completely independently. I moved out on my own, I support myself financially, and I’ve handled everything related to school and life without any help from my family. Yet my mother still expects me to act like the perfect religious daughter, completely ignoring the person I actually am. She also refuses to acknowledge that I no longer share her beliefs.

My younger brother has done nothing productive for the past few years and has even gotten into legal trouble. Still, I feel like I’m judged far more harshly just for trying to live a joyful and honest life outside of strict cultural expectations. He even refuses to meet my boyfriend because he believes I’m living shamefully, which feels incredibly hypocritical.

My boyfriend comes from a kind, open-minded family who treats me like one of their own. He doesn’t understand why my family reacts the way they do. He believes, and I agree, that if someone chooses to immigrate to a new culture, there should be a willingness to adapt and evolve, especially when it comes to respecting individual freedom and happiness.

I know I’m not doing anything wrong. I just want to live my life openly and honestly, and I’d really appreciate any advice on how to talk to my family about this in a way that’s honest but not unnecessarily painful or dramatic. Thanks for reading.

Edit:

Thank you for your advice. I don’t feel that my family is threatening me with any physical harm. My brother has simply expressed that he doesn’t want to meet my boyfriend unless we’re married.

My boyfriend has voiced some concerns as well, but after a conversation with my brother, I felt somewhat reassured. He told me that while he doesn’t support me being in a relationship, he still wishes me nothing but the best for my life and future.

For context, no one in my family knows either my or my boyfriend’s address. We plan to move into his apartment next year, and the city we live in has a population of around 400,000, so we don’t feel particularly exposed. My father is not involved in my life and was never very religious, so I don’t believe he would care much about my relationship.

The real issue for me is the emotional toll  the disappointment I feel from my family and the constant messages that I’ll go to hell. It’s also difficult that my boyfriend can’t fully relate to what I’m going through emotionally, which sometimes leaves me feeling alone in this situation.",4,4,1746821510.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kis268/how_can_i_live_with_disappointing_my_religious/
1kirple,My Bf's sister lowk bullies me and idk what to do,___marmar___,"My (19F) bf's little sister (14F) is so rude to me and I have no idea how to handle it. I have been nothing but nice to her for the three years me and my bf have been dating, and have done nothing to my knowledge to cause her to be this rude to me. For the first year and a half of me and my bf's relationship me and his sister were friendly, we weren't close by any means but we could have convos and laugh and hang out while my bf was gone for a bit. But abt a year and a half ago her personality flipped, she stopped saying hi to me when I come over, and when i said hi to her she would be super dry or just wave and never really said good bye when I left (even though I know their family taught them to always say hello and goodbye to people). This past summer it got to a point where she would almost yell at me over small things. 

One example is that I brought 2 thinks of Tupperware that I borrowed after a party they had and gave it to them. She said in a very accusatory way, ""that container isn't ours. It's yours."" And I thought that it was theres, so I was like ""uh I think that it is yours"" and she got angry and was like ""no. It is yours."" And my bf confirmed that it wasn't theres in a nicer way (im sorry i dont know all of my Tupperware containers by heart?) and i ended up walking out of the kitchen and cried in my car before I left. (Ik that what she said doesn't sound rude but the tone she used and the death stare she gave me lowk killed me inside). This isnt the only situation, she talks down to me whenever me and my bf messing around and only speaks to me to call out something that I did in a very rude way. 

I'm an only child and honestly not good with confrontation so I just sit there and take it, the Tupperware incident is the only time I responded to her and it escalated the situation so ive just learned to ignore her when she is rude to me. Both my bf and his mom have talked to her about being nicer to me and she never changes, she will ""apologize"" but I know she never means it and her attitude towards me never improves. I honestly dread going over to my bfs house now because I don't want to be berated by his sister anymore, but his parents rarely let him come over to my house (whole different story but tldr my mom is a single mom and they dont think she will watch us the whole time, like we need a chaperone). 

I just really dont know what to do or how to get her to stop being rude to me besides waiting until she gets through puberty and hopefully learns empathy or kindness. ",1,1,1746820630.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kirple/my_bfs_sister_lowk_bullies_me_and_idk_what_to_do/
1kirfum,"Help me, am I being unfair for thinking that my family is treating me differently from my family?",RevolutionChance4856,"I (22F) am a middle child between a half brother (24M) and a sister (13F). I am currently living at home with my dad, mom, and younger sister due to financial troubles with hospital bills. 

For context, I recently noticed the calendar for May this year, and realized that both my brother's birthday and my mom's birthday are listed on the calendar. But back in February, when it was my birthday, my birthday was not listed. I ended up writing it down myself, and I was a little hurt that my mom (the one who regularly changes the calendar each month) didn't think to write down my birthday. My brother lives 3 hours away and he was recognized on both my mom's Facebook with a cute cover photo and short paragraph about how much she loves him. Furthermore, my sister has always been recognized on my mom's Facebook as well, with the same kind of loving paragraph. 

Recently, I was scrolling back through my mom's Facebook and happened to notice that my mom hasn't posted a happy birthday post for me since I was young. Like, around 7 or 8, which would be around the time when my sister was born. And yet, my brother and sister both have had a happy birthday post each year.

I feel a little hurt. As I'm looking back on my lifetime, I'm realizing that there have been multiple times where my birthday wasn't recognized by family. This also means not getting a happy birthday call when I did live away from home, or getting a call days later saying, ""Sorry, we totally forgot!"" 
For further context, yes, my brother is my half sibling, with a different birth father. But my own dad (mine and my sister's dad) has been in his life since he was about a year old. When expressing this to people in real life, they ask if maybe my mom is trying to give my brother extra attention due to the fact that his birth father is not around anymore, but my brother hasn't known anything different. 

Am I being a brat for feeling hurt about this, or am I justified? I feel like a total loser for feeling so upset, and I don't want to sound like a brat if I do ever end up talking to my parents about this.

1kiqxlb,please help me figure this out,Worried-Moose-1582,"So, im 18f. i live with my mom, dad and my elder brother. i love them, i really do. but i really dont understand why as a family we cant be happy, caring and loving towards each other. like things between me and my elder brother are very chill, i love him more than anyone else in this world. he gives me everything i need, be it my phone, laptop, shoes i want...jut everything. we have an amazing sibling bond, we share music, talk about stuff. i love him. i look up to him. 

The main issue are my parents. both of them individually are great parents, like i love them. theyve given me everything i have ever asked for, but they are not good husband and wife. they dont fight like crazy or anything, but they dont love each other too. they often come upto me and bitch about each other esp. my mom. like theyll pick on each other for the smallest of issues. we have 3 bedrooms in our house...yet my mom never even enters the room which was supposed to be my mom and dads bedroom. its been almost a yr since we shifted to this new house and shes never slept once in that room. She always sleeps on the sofa which is in the hall. My dad, hes also not less or a victim, hes also as bad as her, but now since around 10-15 days he takes up the space on the hall sofa at night and sleeps there, my mom then started sleeping on the floor. Last 4-5 days shes started coming to my room and sleeps there..but on the floor..and honestly idk if its the teenage hormones or anything but i absolutely hate it. i like to stay up late, do my things in my room, i dont want anyone coming in and ruining my peace. not that my mom yells or says anything to me...she'll just be there in the room on her phone and then lay down and sleep...like there is a room where you can be, i cant stop ignoring it. She never enjoys stuff when we all 4 are together cause my dads there...when its just me, my brother and her its all good. Now i dont know what i want....i want to tell her that i dont like you coming in my room, i want you to go to the other room or something...i told my dad that stop sleeping on the sofa today, but yet he went there again...like i dont know what to do..i dont like this at all. i know its childish....but cant they just love each other. and can my mom just stop making herself the victim and enjoy life...i feel bad for her and for everything shes gone through, but even when there are happy situations she never enjoys and just ruins it for me. We never celebrate festivals...like theres nothing special about them, i see my friends have so much fun on festivals, whereas i have never experienced it. We have never gone on family trips, nothing. am i thinking too much, am i a bad person?",1,2,1746818611.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kiqxlb/please_help_me_figure_this_out/

1kip5or,AITAH- for expecting help from my nephew who is using my car?,Otherwise-Stick-4625,"So I will need to give some context in this scenario and it's going to be long. I 51(F) went through major spinal surgery about 7 months ago and allowed my nephew (18M) to borrow my car. I thought I was being helpful so I allowed him to pay $50 towards the cost of my insurance being $200. I did have cheaper insurance but adding a newer driver there is an increase in premiums and I thought I would be a nice uncle and only charge the difference in my insurance so they could use the car. I advise them constantly that when the insurance was due and that they would need to pay it at that time of the month. I also said because I'm paying for the majority of the insurance, I would like you to come help me and do things around the house. Please note after the surgery I've had to learn to walk again and live on my own. I had 35 days in the hospital and 26 days I  rehabilitation. I live on my own and my support system is in another town 35 minutes away. It was a struggle to do housework and not safe for me.

To get my nephew to pay $50 a month it was a struggle of me chasing after them and sending text messages about money due and when they would come over to help me; my messages were never responded to and payments were always late. 

So I reached out to my sister-in-law regarding the situation and I did have a chat with my nephew let him know that he would be paying now half of the insurance and I and I would appreciate them to still come out and give me some assistance when needed. My nephew 18 male does work a full-time job but their schedule varies as well as Works a couple other odd jobs to make ends. So I do understand the concept of them being busy. My issue is this is family and I've given you a break on using my car and even paying for part of the oil changes and giving extra money for thanks for helping me and I have to chase after the assistance.

My sister-in-law then reached out to me regarding the agreement with my niece and stated that she shouldn't be used in the caregiver role to spend time with me. My sister-in-law growing up had to take care of her mom due to an illness she and never had the best childhood because she was put in that roll and did not want to inflict that on her children. The issue is is I'm not dying  - my issues are not able to walk properly, balance standing, climb stairs, etc - with a paralyzed leg. The main help that I need with his laundry and all I asked is it to be taken downstairs washed and dried and left upstairs for me to fold. I truly don't understand what the big issue is I'm not asking him to wipe my a** or bathe me. I advised my sister-in-law if he's not able to help me out in that capacity- laundry, taking me out. Then he should be paying the full amount of the insurance and all the expenses associated with the car.

I also advised when the payment due date is and if it's not paid on that date and I have to ask for the money, then the car is going back to being parked. And then I can pay parking insurance of a $100 a year instead of double the amount that I normally play to allow my nephew to drive my car.

Fyi, I thought family would help each other - not in my case. Any clarification requested let me know, trying not to type angry.

1kikzq9,"im i the a hole for wanting to leave my father ""options needed""",External-Turnip-8449,"hello everyone english is not my first language so if there are mistakes forgive me.So I male 18 live with my dad 42 and sister 15,a little back story.i was raised in small village along with my siblings and life in village has its bad and good sides,good side was playing in open fields and exploring forests and playing in family tree houses when i said family i mean that it previously belongs to my cousins and now it was ours.Then when i was 12 we moved to city to live with our family,our family lives very close i mean door to door.Now bad side was working,people from village would know.now lets start with story my father is alcoholic and was as long as i can remember when we were little he would always come home drunk and argue with my mom and grandma sometimes he would throw something at them, i remember one time i was sitting in living room with mom and my father would come drunk and yell at me for playing with toys or for juts chewing gum.now to present my father heard some rumors that my mom cheated on him ,they did paternity test and turn out my younger brother is not related to my father there was a big fight and he threw my mom out but he leave my brother with us but week later he also send my brother to live with mom but i and my sister stayed with our father.Month later he also wanted to do paternity test for me and my sister,the test took month to be ready and our father make that month hell for us he would consistently tell us if we were not his he would kick us out and stuff like that,and he would tell us if we were his he would stop drinking and be a better man.When test arrived it proved thet we were his biological children.But instead of quiting alcohol he wanted to know who was father of our brother,he would consistently call my mom and ask her.there were 2 times when he was drunk that he threw my sister and me to go to our mom but next day when he was sober he would ask us to return,and we return. Now your probably wondering why we returned so lets answer it .my father is good man hardworking but it is all in vain when all the money he earn he spend in bar with his friends so my mom had to raise us basically on her own with our grandma.now when mom is gone my sister had to do chores around the house like cleaning,washing clothes and stuff like that i also help of course but our father would always bring his friends and they would mess the whole house and my sister would have to clean it.about food we dont know how to cook so our grandma would send us food or our ant and uncle would call us for dinner,breakfast and lunch. now we are allowed to go to our mother and brother but for little time,so we go after school becouse our father dont know how many classes we have so we go to our brother who is 10 years old i forgot to mention when our mother is at work so he is not alone we also bring most important things to our mom for me ist my manga and lego collection in case he threw us out again and this time we would not return but then our parents would divorce officially and that would mean my little sister might end up with our father becouse he has strings in police and know some people from court. so i fear if she end up with him he would hurt her.so please give me your thoughts on this 🙏 🙏 🙏 ",2,1,1746803743.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kikzq9/im_i_the_a_hole_for_wanting_to_leave_my_father/

1kihdc5,We Traveled to Japan With Our Kids – Here’s What Really Helped (Parent Survival Guide),YourPlanIsOn,"Just got back from a family trip to Japan with our two kids (ages 6 and 10), and I wanted to share what worked, what didn’t, and what I wish we knew earlier.

We tackled everything from long-haul flights and jet lag to food, hotels, and activities like the Ghibli Museum and the Nintendo Museum—both were unforgettable experiences. Japan was amazing—but it took some planning to make it enjoyable for everyone.

I have also put together a video that cover the topic: see comment

Some quick takeaways:

Direct flights with nighttime hours saved our sanity.

Low-dose melatonin for kids helped us manage jet lag during the flight and the first few days.

Choose hotels with extra space—even then, it might feel tight! We found that staying in a ryokan was a great experience for the kids; they loved the futons, tatami floors, and trying out a bit of traditional Japan.

IC Cards (like Suica or Pasmo) are a must. Get them at the ticket office for kids under 12—they travel half price with passport proof. And kids under 5 ride free with a paying adult.

Kid-friendly food is everywhere:

Convenience store favorites like egg mayo sandwiches, katsu sando, and tuna mayo onigiri saved us more than once.

Restaurants like shabu-shabu and yakiniku, where you cook at the table, are fun, interactive, and safe for kids with some supervision.

Conveyor belt sushi places (like Sushiro) are a huge hit—some even offer chances to win pocket toys depending on what you order!


Stamp rallies + Gashapon machines = instant kid motivation.

The Ghibli Museum and Nintendo Museum were the highlights for our kids—interactive, visually rich, and perfect for little fans of animation and gaming.

We didn’t need a stroller, but if you bring one, go for a lightweight, foldable option that can squeeze into packed trains and buses easily.

If you’re thinking about traveling to Japan with kids—or just curious how it actually plays out—I hope this helps!

1kiaekq,My brother is being weird.,,"I'm dealing with a concerning and unusual situation involving my brother, J. and I’m looking for guidance. To maintain privacy, I’ve left out some identifying details.

I moved in with my mom into a two-bedroom apartment. Things were peaceful for a while—just the two of us living together. Later, my brother, who had been living across the country, asked to move in. My mom, feeling lonely, agreed, even though it meant all three of us would share the space, including one bathroom. I had mixed feelings, but we made it work by setting up a curtain in the living room to give him some privacy.

At first, everything seemed normal. But after a few weeks, things started to feel off. One night, while I was up late on my phone, I heard him go to the bathroom. What caught my attention was the sound of heavy walking and faint whispering. At first, I brushed it off. But it kept happening.

Eventually, I quietly approached the bathroom and listened. I could hear him talking to himself, incoherently and intensely, while pacing. It was disturbing—like something you'd associate with a person experiencing a psychotic break. A few nights later, I heard him again—this time from behind his curtain in the living room. He was whispering to himself, making strange noises, and muttering violent-sounding things.

I did once casually mention him being loud in the bathroom, but I never told him I overheard the whispering or strange behavior. He doesn’t seem to know I’m aware.

Some important context:

The whispering is incoherent but sounds agitated or violent.
He has no known history of mental illness, though there is a family history on our mother’s side.
During the day, he acts completely normal.
My mom, who works long hours, is unaware of any of this.
He’s into sports and generally behaves like a typical adult.
He often talks about being a billionaire through day trading, though there’s no evidence to support it—these could be delusions of grandeur.
I'm concerned and unsure what to do. Could this be a sign of a mental health issue? Should I intervene, and if so, how?

Luckily the spare room was free because I was at uni living elsewhere. (In my mum’s flat there is only two bedrooms, and we’d always shared growing up). So it just so happened that ‘our’ old room was free so she moved home to start fresh. Only the issue is that our home town is not really good for employment. The only jobs are retail or working in the local gym. Or joining the army. She studied film and did a master’s in filmmaking, so we’d always figured she’d go into that industry. But after university, she struggled and worked in retail which she’s been doing up until the present, approx. 15 years on and off. She doesn’t enjoy it, to the point she was borderline suicidal when she worked full-time in a shop. Because of this she went part-time without asking my mum first if she could handle her paying less into bills and rent. My mum, being the saint she is, agreed, but she did hint to me she wasn’t happy about it. My sister also said she was going part-time to give herself the time to search for a job she actually wants. 

Well, she’s been ‘searching’ for over a year now… maybe 18 months. And still she’s working part-time in a shop and complaining she doesn’t have any idea what to do job-wise.
To me, it’s obvious! She’s so knowledgeable in film, knows the ins and outs of filmmaking due to her degrees (bachelor and a master’s), and goodness knows she loves movies and television - she should work in that industry, or at least give it a good go to try get a job in that area. But when I asked her about it, she just cited ‘it’s bad for job security’ and ‘that was the old me’… but I kinda feel like that’s a copout. I think she’s scared of failure and disappointing everyone. If you really want to do something, you do it despite the risks, surely? I was so desperate to work in my field that I took a job in another country! But she seems to be just ignoring the field which was once her dream job. She’s just looking at generic jobs nearby now. But she wants to move out of our home town. So why bother looking at jobs in the same town! I dunno… I feel like she can’t admit to herself what she really wants to do. What she’s really talented at: writing and film!

I’ve always been the sympathetic ear whenever she calls me for the annual ‘I’m not getting anywhere, I want to be happy but I’m not’ conversation. But as I’m getting older and having my own work/life frustrations, I have less and less patience for her repeating the same stuff every single time. She gets to work part-time, pay less rent if any sometimes, have lots of free time to work on her mental health… while I have to work full-time to be able to afford living an independent life, me and my boyfriend have rent to pay and we can’t slack off when we want to, I have my own mental health issues but I still gotta work because I want money to pay for things… hell, i’ve had health issues but I still had to go to work! I went through a period of chronic headaches and tmj issues and just got on with it because I had to! Like I just wish she could see the bigger picture here. Which is, if she didn’t have my mum or if my mum wasn’t being so nice, she would have to work full-time to be able to afford rent and food, etc. 
I don’t think she realises how lucky she is. I’m not jealous of her - I’m actually glad I never moved home for the exact reason my sister is struggling now. But sometimes I just want to shake her and say ‘get a grip and get a job’.
Want to move out? You gotta work.
Want a job you love? You gotta be brave and go for it!
Want to protect your mental health? Babe you already got the skills (she’s already in therapy and knows her triggers now). It’s not like she has been so bad that she was taken to a psych ward. Sure, depression is not a small issue, but I think her case is manageable especially if she’s doing a job she’s actually interested in and getting paid well for!

I remember having this ‘I feel lost’ conversation with her when she turned 30 a few years ago. I just don’t want to be having the same conversation when she turns 40. Because I know she’ll be beside herself. And there’s nothing I can do because it’s not my life! It’s hers.

I also feel like living at home has kind of stunted her life experience. Living in your childhood home and sleeping in the room you grew up in has got to do something to your brain in terms of restricting how far you can go as an adult… because you have constant reminders of who you were as a kid. Living with my mum in a small town, dating is non-existent, job opportunities are limited, your independence limited. The time in my life when I really saw growth in myself was when I moved out and lived away from my parents. Apart from the job/career situation, I feel like she’s missing out on so much life stuff she should be enjoying as a single thirty-something. Hell, that she should have been enjoying in her twenties. And sometimes that leads to her not really having a grip on reality like I do… rent isn’t gonna pay for itself, the only person who can change your life is you, you can’t expect people to go easy on you - more often than not they go hard on you, life is frickin’ hard, complex, a grey area. I’ve learnt all of this stuff but I don’t think she has. She is still on the hunt for perfection, the perfect job, the life calling…. And I know from life experience living on my own that the perfect everything is a con. There is no perfect job. I don’t love my job but I can do it because I have the skills and I enjoy some parts of the job. But am I working on my passion projects outside of work? Hell yeah. Her pursuit of finding the perfect job is actually hindering her search. She’s putting way too much pressure on herself to ‘get it right this time’. 

Do you know what it is that frustrates me? It’s the fact she is expecting the perfect career, the the purpose in life kinda career, the independence of living on her own… but she isn’t willing to graft for it because she might get burned out again. Please, if most people went part-time because they were a tiny bit burnt out, the economy would crumble! To me, her fear of full-time work because it ‘might make me depressed again’ is just not good enough. It’s not realistic if you want to be independent. I’d love to take a say off when my medication makes me feel depressed… do I though? No because I live in reality. And her being so out of touch sometimes pees me off a bit. Because I HAVE TO go to work.

I feel bad saying all this about my sister. I love her soo much. I just want her to be happy, but you know when someone is telling you they’re not happy again and again and yet they’re not really putting themselves out there to make themselves happy? Yeah, it gets to ya after a while. One conversation went like this:
Sister: Ah my car needs work done on it. I don’t have the money. I need more money!
Me: Okay can you pick up some extra shifts at work? Have you considered full-time work again?
Sister: I dunno… I’m just worried I’ll get depressed again.
Ne: Okay so don’t work any more hours.
Sister: But I need money

And round and round it went. It was so frustrating!

Has anyone else had a similar experience with a sibling who seems lost and isn’t reaching the goals they want? Do you give them the sympathetic ear or do you go hard on them?

1ki6emo,"My sister won't speak to me because I moved out, need advice",JellyfishAccurate429,"Help I really need advice. I tried make this as short as possible, so it's not too much to read, but happy to provide addl info as needed. 

Trigger warning: substance abuse 

Background: 
I moved into my mom's house 17 years ago when I divorced my abusive ex husband. Also living there was my older sister & nephew (my dad passed away when I was 8 y.o). I had 3 kids, one was a newborn when I moved. Due to the abuse, I had health problems & became addicted to Rx pain pills. My sister has always lived with my mom, never moved out/married. 

I struggled with addiction for 13 of the past 17 years. I'd get clean for 1-3 years & try to move out from my mom's, and they told me I ""wasn't allowed"" - at first, they said I couldn't take my kids if I moved, bc they were afraid I'd relapse. Then, said I had to ""help fix the house"" before I was allowed to move out. I am 41 years old. I stressed that I was afraid I'd relapse living there, surrounded by my former drug dealers, and usually did. The dealers would legit give me free pills to get me hooked again if I saw them out in public anywhere. It's a very small town, hard to avoid them if I went anywhere out of the house. 

Things of note: 

1. My mom is an ""animal hoarder,"" she has small dogs she used to breed, had some in a kennel and some on the house. At one point, the ""kennel"" was in the carport attached to the house. The house always smelled like dogs, pee/poop. The dogs in the house weren't house broke & peed/pooped everywhere. My mom didn't clean after them (sister  & I did). She currently has 5 dogs inside, but it's been as many as 40 over the years. She also smokes 3 packs a day, inside, and 2 of my kids have asthma, reactive to smoke. 

2. My family helped me a lot financially over the years, particularly when I was trying to get clean & was sick in withdrawal and couldn't work for a month or so. Otherwise, I always kept a job. Ex doesn't pay child support regularly, so it was always only my income for me & my kids. I'd always try to repay them, but I'm sure I never fully repaid. I once bought my mom a car, paid for it in full  ($12k rebuilt title car, not like a BMW or something fancy). I'd always let my sister claim one is my kids on her taxes so she'd get $5-6k refund, as opposed to nothing w/o them. 

3. My mom's house is pretty run down due to lack of maintenance over the years. Leaking roof, sinks don't work, hole in shower wall, water line broke to the toilet, etc. We couldn't ever pay someone to come fix stuff when it broke because of the smell/mess from the dogs. 

CURRENT ISSUE:
A month ago, I found a place to rent & moved out with 2 of my 3 kids. Oldest moved out on his own already & has a wife and baby, whom I never see because they don't come to my mom's house due to the mess & her constant smoking. My sister is unbelievably angry, she says we couldn't ever fix the house because I was always on/off drugs, and we couldn't ever afford it. She's mad/upset that I ""left her there"" after she's always been there for me over the years. I tried to get her to move out also, as I think the house is beyond repair, but she won't. 

She has removed me from all social media and hasn't spoken to me since I moved. I told her if I stay there, I will lose my relationship with my children. She said I should stay there and help fix the house before I move. However, I have been clean & drug free for almost 4 years now. No one has even tried to fix anything in the house over the past 4 years, and my sister makes 2x what I do. She is very irresponsible with her $$. For example: She just lied on her taxes to get a bigger refund, which she used as a down payment for a new car, but instead of trading her old car on, she's going to do a voluntary repo. 

What do I do?? Am I wrong for moving out & giving my kids a healthy, clean place to live? What can I do to salvage my relationship with my sister? Should I try to give her money as I can to fix the house? ",4,1,1746752969.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ki6emo/my_sister_wont_speak_to_me_because_i_moved_out/
1ki4rjt,family drama over moms money AITA,Icy-Maintenance-5495,"I’m the youngest of 5. 4 sisters and a brother who are in our 60’s and 70’s. My parents made my oldest brother and sister the executives of their estate, and my father passed away 15 years ago, leaving my mom with a substantial amount of money. My oldest brother and second youngest sister have had control of the money for the last 15 years. They have helped themselves to huge amounts of money without letting the rest of us know. Just taking money when they pleased. My mother is now 94 with dementia (which she’s had for about 5 years) and a year ago, the money ran out and they (brother and sister involved) asked us all to contribute every month, which like a sucker I did. The sister that  helped herself to the money and dished out plenty of money to the brother, decided, after a year that she didn’t want to pay my mom’s monthly fee anymore, which really upset me as I’ve never had a cent over all these years. So I demanded to see bank statements for the prior three years and started seeing all these huge amounts of money that have been taken out by her and my brother. I asked for more bank accounts going back of further five years and so even more unknown large quantities of money just being taken and supposedly paid back. My brother was the worst and would just ignore me whenever I asked if certain monies were paid back. Finally, my oldest sister (one of the executors) got involved but used me as the one to communicate with them so now I’m the bad guy. The sister and the brother involved won’t talk to me and I get a yes, no answer every time I try and ask a question about certain accounts and monies. I’m now visiting my mother staying in a rented place for the next three weeks and the sister involved won’t talk to me or see me even though I’ve offered to have coffee. AITA for wanting to know what loans they’ve taken and how and if they repaid the loans? All the money the sister had borrowed/taken, she never paid a cent of interest. As a result of the plundering and pillaging of this account of my mother’s, they used up all my mom’s money. My dad was such a cautious man with his money. He saved and saved and saved, and the year after he died, my brother started taking money. Finally, when she (sister) knew she got busted for a loan that she took out and never repaid 9 years ago, she moved a lump sum back into the account and I’m no longer going to be having to pay every month because this should cover my mother for well over a year or two.

1ki4mz2,Family Group Chats,CabinetMaleficent901,"When I first started dating my husband, I became aware of his family's group chat, which they were fairly active in and it included his sister, brother-in-law, and parents. They would share photos of things they were doing, memes, the normal things you might expect in a group chat. I would say that it was used maybe 3-4 times per week on average.

  
Since we got married, however, they completely stopped communicating on it. We did have many and various issues come up with them, especially once we started to set boundaries and the relationship he had with them was no longer completely on their terms; his sister is older and got married over ten years ago, so he very much used to accomodate everyone else as the single one in the family. That made it very difficult to readjust expectations once I came into the picture. 

  
There's been a lot of progress made, however, especially in the past few months and communication has vastly improved. For some reason though, this family group chat has permanently ended and everything I've tried to do to resurrect it has failed. I've started to share things in it from trips or funny pictures and try to do the same type of thing they used to use it for in the past, but I hardly ever get much interaction beyond an emoji or any sort of follow-up. Essentially, I am the only one who is using it to communicate.

  
In part, it is making me feel rejected, and also, confused as to why my attempts at reaching out haven't resulted in them reaching back. I thought perhaps I just needed to get the ball rolling, but they don't seem intersted in playing, so to speak. I also don't want to read \*too\* much into it since maybe they've gotten used to not having a family group chat so people just communicate more one-on-one now. 

  
I would love advice as to how to handle it, since I am thinking about saying something directly about the group chat and how I'd like to be able to interact in it again, but I also don't want to thwart the progress we've made or for them to perceive it as an attack.

1ki3l8p,I wish my dad didnt come home,ynrh_,"I'm a teenager right now and my dad is in his late 40s. He decided he took care of us enough and he started going out to parties almost everyday, with him missing work sometimes.

I used to want him at home a lot, and I would be fussy about his absense when he said that he's going out to parties and dates. But lately everytime he's home, he refuses to spend time with us without him being completely drunk.

He only stays for dinners, and whenever we have a family dinner, he drinks a lot. Then he starts to either scream at me about my ""laziness"", my ""horrible personality"", or even my body.

I feel mostly happy when I have to go to volleyball practice late at night, and sometimes I try to get home late so that I know my dad won't be home drunk and he'll be passed out. He'll always find a way to scream curse words at me and degrade me when I'm right infront of him and eating.

If he's not home, I don't get yelled at. And when he's home eating dinner, I force myself to stay upstairs and skip dinner altogether. He thinks he's doing us a favor by staying home but lately he commented about how ""hot"" my body is, how I'm on my phone all day, or how he'll kick me out and let me get r*ped so that I'll ""learn a lesson"".

1ki1vov,Can someone help me with my sister?,MellMell1234,"Actually had to extra make a new account for this but I really don’t know what to do and tbh I’m really at my limit.

My younger sister (she turns 17 next week) and her Friend (16) were in another city over a long weekend like 2weeks ago, just as a “girls trip” and I (F19) was out of the country during that time.

Now I thought she had fun and everything went smoothly but she actually told me some fr crazy shit.

I don’t really want to go into detail but basically they met some guys there and lied that they’re turning 18 the following week, they slept at their place (or hotel I’m not sure tbh) for two of the three nights they stayed and she did some “things” with him (they didn’t do “it” but he clearly wanted to and he tried to change her mind and almost did it without her consent) in general he really tried to push her to do things she didn’t want (she “only” did some things)

Then he also ripped 30$ from him as “gas money” and he got like very aggressive and just left them afterwards at the gas station in the middle of nowhere.

Also when they told them they were minors and that it would be a shame if the police were to find out (He’s 28 btw!!!) he came back and was so mad he wanted to get something out of his car and his friend had to stop him and said “are you crazy?” So we’re thinking it was a gun or a knife idk but it was something 100%.
But then they left them again and they had to get a cab 

And that was just a bit of what happened.

I just found out about all this and I wanted to cry tbh because thats my lil sister and I feel like I failed as an older sister because I wasn’t there to help her or do anything.

We talked a bit and I got visibly mad, and then she said they want to go back in a few weeks (a month after they went before) but not to meet the guys again.

I REALLY don’t want her to go and I’m sorry but she said she knows it was dumb and that she learned from her mistakes but I really don’t trust her since she always says stuff like that and then she does it again (though this is the first time something like this happened)

Ngl I’m really scared and I’m not gonna be there again when she goes and I tried to say why don’t you somewhere else but she doesn’t listen, and I personally think that she wants to go again because her friend wants to go (I don’t really trust her especially when it comes to boys and ik she’s also just 16 but still she’s very focused on boys in a unhealthy way and even suggested before to meet up with “her guy” just to talk (they also cut off contact so that won’t happen but yk)

I know I can’t do much but I don’t know what to do rn, I don’t want to tell our parents but I also don’t want them to go, there are so many other cities why can’t they go somewhere else??? But she doesn’t listen to me, Instead she thinks she is a grown up and can handle it (she clearly can’t)

1ki1gpf,My mum is very immature and I think she may be stunted,flyingfarts00,"I (F24) live in the UK in the same house as my mum (F53) I'm autistic and have ADHD. I get benefits but they go into her bank account because she doesn't want me to work. I don't even know how much I get per month because she won't tell me. 

When she was married to my dad she used to cheat on him and would sext married men. She still does it and one time was even planning to have sex with a guy not much older than me in my house, while I was asleep in the next room. Didn't know this guy from Adam and he could've been a rapist or anything, so I didn't feel safe. There was also a guy she'd been seeing for a couple of weeks when I was 17, who always commented on how beautiful I was and saying he'd have to chase boys away (he was 48) and she let him stay overnight, despite my protests and the fact she'd only known him for 2 weeks. 

I really want to move out but with my circumstances it's so hard to get my own place. My mum loves to tell everyone I'm autistic and makes out I'm much worse than I am in order to seek sympathy and validation. 

I was on holiday with my family and my boyfriend and she tried to take my bra off in front of my dad because I had chest pain. I pushed her hands away and she said I attacked her. My dad and my boyfriend were pissed off with her for trying to take off my bra in front of my dad and how uncomfortable it made me. 

She is also an absolute clean freak and has too much energy, always playing her music too loud. I find her very overwhelming. My boyfriend (M27) may have undiagnosed autism and he even gets overwhelmed by my mum. She accused him of being ignorant and having no respect for her but he just doesn't know how to deal with her and he said she treats me like I'm 12 which concerns him, yet it's okay when her friend's son, who she's wanted me to be with since we were children to be a completely rude prick and she'll talk about how much of a ""lovely, successful handsome boy"" he is. She forced me to kiss him at her wedding when I was 4 and you can clearly see me looking uncomfortable and leaning away in the picture and I got in trouble for being rude. It really fucked up my understanding of consent because a girl sexually abused me when I was 9 and then my ex raped me three and a half years ago and I felt really uncomfortable telling her. 

She tries to guilt trip me into being friends with her best friend's daughter, who was bombarding me with messages, which overwhelmed me (she has a learning disability, so I don't think she understood my boundaries or my personal space which absolutely wasn't her fault) but we have absolutely nothing in common either.

As a child, she never showed me how to do household tasks, so I don't know how to do some things. I don't know if she genuinely forgot or it was some kind of deliberate ploy so that I can't leave. 

I'm never allowed to be unwell, have a migraine (which I get quite a lot), be forgetful due to my ADHD or be tired without being accused of being lazy. 

She constantly accuses me of things I didn't do and I have to shout the truth at her until I'm blue in the face. She also accuses me of laughing at her when I haven't. 

I don't know what to do. I feel so stuck and I can't even get my own place because I don't know how much money I get and I'm not allowed a job. She's also my appointee and wanted herself and my brother to get guardianship of me. I just want to be treated like a normal woman for fuck sake.

She's trying to see if these people can see my kid before they travel back to their home state. 
We are likely going to say HELL NO and you can't try to force us to let these people meet our daughter either. We have proven before that we put our kids first , before others feelings.

1khv94w,Was I an Ahole for not giving my cousin much attention at dinner? Kinda feel like I was.,Wonderful-Argument9,"
I (26F) recently attended a workshop at a university near San Francisco, which is across the country from me. I’m a PhD student living on the east coast. Growing up, I had an aunt uncle and two cousins who lived in the Bay Area. Aunt uncle and one cousin still do, but my other (call her ‘J’) moved to the east coast a few years ago for nursing school (but still a few states up from me). 

To give you some background, my cousin is my dad’s niece and her mom is my dad’s sister. My dad’s second wife (stepmom) has always fawned over J and constantly compared me to her, telling me I should be more like her and less like myself. J is basically stepmoms adopted golden child. The last time I saw J, she was still in nursing school and decided to spend thanksgiving with stepmom, sisters and I. My dad was at work the whole time, but I still flew up to see everyone and be a supportive family member. Stepmom took a jab at me (insulting my career path by telling me I’d never make as much money as my cousin) in front of everyone. It really hurt me so I got upset. Cousin then had the nerve to try and talk me down instead of sticking up for me being bullied. Everyone else then went back to giggling around and I went upstairs to be alone. Stepmom came up and started hollering at me with her “I’m right!!” mentality. The next day at thanksgiving, people asked me if I was ok, even though they 100% knew it was stepmom that caused the hurt. That meal was so awkward. 

Flash forward to the night before I fly out to my workshop, aunt uncle and I already had plans to get dinner at a really nice restaurant in the area. Aunt texts me as I’m setting my alarm that J will all of a sudden be joining us, as she’s coming out last minute for a friends bachelorette. I didn’t say anything to aunt but felt a knot in my stomach. Oh great, now I have to engage with a flying monkey of my #1 bully 🫠

I arrive at the dinner and see my aunt sitting at the bar with J, and went straight to giving her a hug. I then strayed away from J as I didn’t wish to give her one on arrival (or really at all…). We sat at the table and aunt asks me all about school and work. I kept my eye contact on aunt as I told her about everything new and exciting about my world. Cousin tried asking me a few questions, I gave her minimal eye contact and simple answers, then went back to giving aunt my full engagement. At the end of dinner, I thanked aunt, hugged her, and gave her a gift I brought for them. Cousin went in to give a hug, I kept it quick, then told them goodbye before heading out. 

Here’s the thing, looking back I kinda feel like I was a bit rude to cousin, but then I also remembered that it’s ok to distance yourself from those who support your tormentors.

1khrwg0,Need advice on handling Parents and Wife after marriage.,Worldly_Poem_2157,"I am 29M, recently married. 
I live with my wife in a different city due to Job. 
My wife is currently not working but looking for jobs.
My parents have a lot of expectations from my wife which are not being met. Some of them are reasonable but some are very backward thinking (like she should ask them before going to her home) Whenever I try to defend her in the later cases, my dad and mom get offended and think that I have changed after marriage. My wife is also not very understanding, she gets offended easily. Usually things are fine between us though. 
There are a lot of other details, but overall the issue is that my parents expect her to be like a typical housewife bahu which they have seen or work a good job. And currently she is not in either category. 
I am ok with everything, I just want everyone to live happily. I sense that going forward there are going to be a lot of issues due to differences in values. 
We had a couple of intense arguments also. It's been less than 3 months to our marriage and I already feel burdened by all this.

1khpsvf,Brother is an addict and wants to get my initials tattooed,mickeyp145,"Me (31) and my brother (26) lost our mum suddenly last year to cancer, and I cared for her while she was dying. This has effected us both profoundly, and brother has developed a substance abuse problem and is drinking and taking a mix of a few different drugs daily. He’s recently admitted he’s got a problem, and admitted he finds it impossible to go a few days dry as he just relapses and goes off the rails. I’m actively trying to get him help for this. He’s been doing a lot of irresponsible things like forgetting to feed his dog, trashing the family home, spending excessively and he recently also sent his ex £1000 because he felt guilty about the way things ended between them. 

It’s my birthday next week and today he called me and sounded intoxicated, and told me he’s just booked to get my initials tattooed on him as a surprise, but couldn’t wait to tell me. He kept telling me he loves me and looks up to me because of the way I cared for mum, and it feels like he sees the tattoo as a gesture to show me this. I cant help feeling uncomfortable about it though because it will be his first tattoo and I don’t think he’s in the right place to be making decisions like this considering the state he’s in at the moment. Is there anything I can say to him without undermining the gesture? ",1,3,1746710039.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1khpsvf/brother_is_an_addict_and_wants_to_get_my_initials/

1khp2h3,My sister is marrying the wrong guy,shelby_2004_,"Hello, I’m coming in here looking for actual advice and help with my situation 

So I female 20y/o and my sister 22 y/o have always been close but lately not so much.

So a year ago my sister three year relationship with a guy who is seven years older than her. So they live together and she moved back in with my parents and I lived there shortly with her until me and my boyfriend moved out together. There’s a relationship she took to online dating and started hanging out with other guys but then she met this one guy that she is now with and I am having some issues with that. I want her to be happy and I care a lot about her, but I’m having some issues with her current boyfriend so back on them they’ve been together now for eight months they started dating in August 2024. He has a lot of red flags and I don’t think she sees them. He has a 10-year-old kid or or 11. He had her when he was 15 in high school and he doesn’t see her and he is now 27 or 28 and no one thinks that that’s an issue. They moved in together only knowing each other for three months they started wearing wedding bands on their hand at two months the first time he met my family. They decided to get drunk and come to family Christmas when there was no alcohol at our family Christmas at all. I must mention that he is also in the military so because he’s in the military, he is leaving for deployment in May for a year now here’s the biggest issue they’ve only been together for eight months keep in mind and they are now engaged in wedding planning obviously I haven’t really supported this relationship very much and she texted me about a week ago stating pretty much that I will not be in the wedding party because she feels that I don’t support the relationship and if I want to be in the wedding party that it is up to me to fix the broken relationship now he is leaving in a week and I have no interest in hanging out with him or her and I also feel like my entire family is blindsided by him he treats my mom like he is she is his mom which I found is very weird. We’ve only met him a handful of times because they’ve been together for less than a year and when he gets back in May 2026, they’ll be getting married in October so they’ll only be together for not even two years and they’ll be married. 
What do I do, sensitive about everything and is very defensive whenever I bring up anything I helped her through her entire three year relationship break up, which is very hard for her, which is understandable, but she’s had this pattern of dating not the right men. I just really don’t know what to do and I feel as if my parents are just supporting her because they don’t wanna overstep their boundaries with her either.",3,3,1746707936.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1khp2h3/my_sister_is_marrying_the_wrong_guy/

As the title suggests, oftentimes I wonder if I'm the problem ? For context, I'm the oldest child of my family and I usually just feel this deep dark sadness that I think is associated with being the oldest child ? Like I feel very sad for a lot of things - not being able to live up to potential, causing my parents to lash out at my younger sister because of me, just being scolded, not standing up for myself etc. ( If I begin a list, we'll be sitting here for hours ) and so I just thought that this is one of those things that you just subscribe to as an oldest child

But, whenever I see other oldest siblings ( my same age ) in my vicinity, they seem to have their entire lives together ( their parents are happy, their siblings adore them, my parents are happy looking at them )  and so this just has me questioning - Am I the only making a mountain out of a molehill ( aka - am I overreacting and my problems are just insignificant ) ? Or am I the depressed, soul sucking black spot on the family ( both are negative I know - humor me ) .

1khiv3o,Am I wrong for being mad at my mom still after 10 years?,ThisWitness7653,"So trying to keep a long story short but not really feel free to ask questions and I’ll elaborate. Nearly ten years ago when I was with my ex boyfriend (terrible relationship he used drugs the entire relationship and hasn’t stopped even to this day) cut to D-day after 9 months of hell. My mother and I never got along, she’s always had it out for me and I’ve cut that woman out of my life now but to this day I’m still pissed about what happened in the delivery room. My mom, sister, and ex were in the room while we waited for things to progress. I was given IV drugs that left me blacking out I could hardly keep my eyes open and when I did open them I was delirious begging for the epidural that just wasn’t coming. Now my contractions weren’t happening the way they should’ve been and I was only at 4cm cramping so bad it was taking my breath away at this point I asked my ex to touch my leg cause I felt really alone through the whole ordeal and I needed someone to touch me to feel grounded, no one was holding my hand no one was comforting me and my mom looked annoyed so I just needed someone to grab me to keep me from feeling like I was. Well the moment he grabbed my leg a contraction hit me like a ton of brick and I said “Don’t fucking touch me.” I just blurted it out not because I meant to but because I needed to stop him quickly while I was contracting because I felt like it would just hurt more. It wasn’t a sane thought I was delirious. Anyway immediately after I said that my mom chimed in saying “You’re acting like a real bitch ya know that. You asked him to touch you?"" I ignored it and just withdrew, I was exhausted and things weren’t progressing the way they should. I remember blacking out so often and when I got the epidural I jumped from 4cm to 8cm immediately and I couldn’t keep my eyes open long enough to push let alone be aware of much else going on in the room. Baby’s heart rate ended up dropping and I was carted off for an emergency c section.

Now roll forward about 8 years (second baby) from that I was hell bent on giving birth naturally with epidural just no pain meds, ended up having to have a c section which re traumatized me because I didn’t get to experience birth the way I wanted with my now husband and loving partner. My mom didn’t even show up or meet my daughter for like 4/5 months cause I told them if they’re gonna hold her they need to have not smoked for an hour and wash their hands… that’s a completely different story though. But I’m still pissed at my mom to this day because in my most vulnerable moment she wasn’t there for me.

1khgpyq,Issues with little sister,SpecialGradePookie,"Hi, I(16f), have had a few reoccurring issues with my sister,A,(14f)

Basically I’d say we have a pretty dysfunctional home life, and because of that I’m gone most of the time, staying with my grandparents. A stays at our house, but for the past 3 weeks, I’ve been staying around my house. It’s not as if I never saw her, I’d come home on Wednesdays and Weekends, and other random nights, and most of the time we’d have an argument, but it seems to be way worse now that I’m at home a lot


She’s always been pretty irritable, but as of this school year, it’s been ramping up, to the point even our parents comment on it. I’ll be the first to say I know she a lot of different factors going on, she just switched schools because she never seems to find a place she quite likes. Meaning she’s mostly getting up at like 5 in the morning. A lot of the house work tends to fall on her as well, but since I’ve been home I’ve been trying to help, though this week I’ve really fallen back on it. 

I understand it could be resentment for her responsibilities, after all I don’t think one person should be expected to handle the house work. But I don’t know, other than that she doesn’t really like me specifically I guess. She gets along with our older sister most days, and when she’s not being mouthy she’s also good with my mom and dad, so I guess it probably has something to do with me.

I just want to help, but it seems she doesn’t wanna hang out unless she needs something, like HW help or wants me to make her food. Otherwise she’s snappy and always seems annoyed in my presence.


It kinda culminated today, or more of last night. She was snappish again yesterday, and I needed clothes for today, so when looking around I found some of her clothes on the bathroom floor. Part of it was that I need more to throw in the load, other part is I figured it might relieve some of the stress? So I threw it in with my stuff, and made sure they were dry in the morning. Well at like 5 am she wakes me up, and I guess kinda snaps at me asking where I put it? It was early, and I just remember her being upset and the flashlight in my face, but I assume I tell her


Later today, when everyone’s home, she comes into my room, and starts looking around, claiming she needed to see if I stole anything from her room. She finds a bronzer, which my older sister told me I could have but I assume she gave it to both of us, and a claw clip that had been in the bathroom along with all the rest of the communal things, menstrual products, toothbrush’s, etc. We have a bit of a spat that results in me telling her to go or I’d call my dad, but later tonight I had dropped off something in my older sisters room, which is right next to A’s, and find the socks I had thrown in with the load from last night on the floor.


So I go find her, and she’s about to shower, and I am a bit snappish, I know that if I wanna fix things I have to put best foot forwards, and she seems to have had a hard night, and it ends up in another fight, where she lists all the things she had gotten in a fight with out mom about, and asking if I was going to say them as well. I don’t, I kinda just stand there because this is how about 60% of all our arguments go. I’ll get upset, and then she’ll kinda just shut down, just to get me to leave and then she won’t fix whatever she’s done.



I end up just point out she was being a hypocrite, and she says she’s had a stressful night, and I argue that she’s always stress and keep asking when we get a conversation, she says I don’t. I point out the fact that the only time she seems to wanna talk to me, is when she needs something. She then points out that it’s the same, and can only argue doing all my chores, so I argue back that since I’ve been back I’ve also taken back most of my chores. It goes back and forth till finally I just ask if anything I’ll say she’ll take as a personal attack against her, and she just says it is. 

I want to have a good relationship with her, because she is one of the coolest and kindest people I know, but I know she resents me for a lot of things. I wanna know how this looks to an outsider, because I’m aware that some of what I do is wrong, but I am biased. I’ll take any perspectives, even if they’re cursing me to hell and back. I just want to fix this.


TLDR: Had a spat with my sister and I realize they all kinda go like this, curious as what I can do to fix it",5,1,1746675565.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1khgpyq/issues_with_little_sister/
1khgg9p,How do I deal with my sister body shaming her daughter?,Softestblanket222,"My sister has recently developed an obsession with having “the perfect body” and that’s awesome for her, but she’s expanding it beyond her own body.. 
She has 2 kids. 9, and 6. 
The 6year old is gloated upon because she hardly eats and is very skinny, that’s just her body-type. The 9 year old is constantly talked down upon. Her food intake is constantly up for discussion, her weight is a near constant subject.
We’re sitting at my 9yo niece’s soccer game, and my sister looks at me and says “she’s on the verge of being obese” which is far from the truth. She is a healthy young lady, her body is getting ready for puberty, she’s healthy.
My sister has gone as far as giving my niece detox pills+mixes, and has made her fast for days at a time. To the point where my niece is physically ill.
Healthy eating and an active lifestyle is one thing I can totally get behind. All of the fasting + detoxing + criticism is a whole different topic. 
I’m worried this is going to destroy my niece’s body image forever. 
My sister and my niece’s dad are both tall and bulky, my niece’s body will probably be the same. I don’t want the 9yo to struggle with the idea that she has to be super duper skinny to be comfortable in her body. 
I just can’t figure out how to talk to my sister about this. She does not listen, she does not understand how harmful her ideas(and actions) can be. There’s an issue here and I’m not even sure how to talk to my sister about it. She’s like a bully from an early 2000s movie. 

I tell my niece how beautiful she is, but I’m not her mother. My words aren’t going to fix any injuries that she gets from her mother. I genuinely don’t know what to say to my sister; I don’t even know if I should. I just cannot deal with her talking so much negative shit about this child’s body, it’s weird as hell to me.

1kheebl,"I unearthed a family secret, and now I don't know what to do.",ej2013,"I started writing this not knowing if I would post it, but here we go:

I’m a bit stuck as to what to do. I (30s F) grew up with separated parents- my mom and dad married when I was a 2, but divorced when I was 3ish. I grew up thinking they found out they were pregnant young (19 and 20) and decided to try to make it work for my sake. After they separated, they each remarried- my mom and step-dad had a son, and my dad and step-mom had 2 sons. This was my normal, and I never thought to question it. 

I found out this year that my dad isn’t my biological father. My parents have both always known, as my mom found out she was 2 months pregnant a few weeks after they started dating. They decided to tell almost no one, and decided early on that my dad was my dad, and that was that. 

I found out recently, by accident, and my mom admitted that while she wouldn’t have lied if I asked, she never intended to tell me. My biological father (who I lovingly refer to as ‘sperm donor’) apparently wasn’t a great person. They had been seeing each other for a while before she found out she was pregnant, but were never serious, and she cut off contact when she found out he was involved in some less than legal ventures. She believes that the last week she was in contact with him was when she got pregnant. She did tell him later that she was pregnant, but he denied I could be his (I do know from 23andMe that I am- after finding out his name I used [Ancestry.com](http://Ancestry.com) and verified I’m related to a bunch of his cousins). He did later reach out to my mom when I was a baby, and when she said she was doing okay he never contacted again.

I want to make clear that I have no desire to know him. I am very close to my dad and step-dad, who I also just call dad. Being that have two dads that chose and fought for me, and don’t feel the need to hold space for a man who chose not to… especially not one with a long list of felony convictions. When you google his name the first results are mug shots. 

My internal debate is about his family- he has 3 kids that I know about, including a daughter 2-3 years older than me. While I have not desire to reach out to him, I would be lying to say I wasn’t curious about his other children and his parents (who I believe are in their 70s). I literally daydreamed as a child about having a sister or siblings close to my age as a child, but this is honestly a bit too weird to wrap my head around.

My mom does not want me to reach out- she’s made it clear that it’s my decision, but she’s fearful of me getting involved with my biological father’s family given the history (he isn’t the only one with a concerning criminal history). Also, I get the impression she’s scared of him to some extent… to be transparent, she’s indicated to me their relationship/fling was consensual and he’s never hurt or threatened her, but she doesn’t like to talk about him and seems to get nervous when he comes up.

My dad’s family- or those who know at least- have been clear that me knowing changes nothing and that I’ll always be their’s. My mom has made clear that every decision made was to protect me and that the story is now mine to own and handle as I want to, and that she will support any decision I make.  I’m honestly not mad because I have an amazing and supportive family, and given my own mental health journey might not have coped well if I had learned this younger. However, I’d be lying to say I wasn’t curious- especially about the siblings and grandparents. I don’t want to hurt my mom, and I’m worried about ‘opening Pandora’s Box’ as it is, but I also can’t say that I’ll never want to reach out or know more. I’m wondering if anyone else has been through a similar situation and how they chose to respond?",6,8,1746668186.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kheebl/i_unearthed_a_family_secret_and_now_i_dont_know/
1khd680,Best places to raise kids,Key_Interaction_6544,"Hi - 

I spent majority of my life in NY and my husband in the Midwest. We have two kids who are both under 4, and we’ve been reflecting where we want to be long term as a family. I would love this group’s experiences and thoughts about locations if you are willing to brainstorm with us. 

A little bit of context:

The Midwest is too cold for us, although we recognize cost living and education can be decent pros. NY is wildly expensive. And those two areas is all we truly know for having lived in both places for a long time. We have visited many states but not long enough to have an opinion about living.  

We would like to prioritize the following when choosing our potential home state:

1. By the ocean 

2. Decent public education options

3. Family friendly (not just designed for millionaires and/or young people who live in studios due to cost of living)

4. Preferably an area with multinational companies around (we both work for multinational companies in our state today and we know not every area has big companies). I know remote work could be an option but we also love being plugged into an organization physically. 

Am I looking for a “unicorn” location? Does that place exist in the US? 

We have considered Portland, San Diego, New Jersey, Charlotte, Philadelphia, and Alexandria, but I don’t know enough to make an informed decision. Would love some knowledge sharing from this group ❤️",1,2,1746664454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1khd680/best_places_to_raise_kids/

Whenever I do something small to him he just fucking snitches on me to my parents. Like if I push him a little - “mam he pushed me”. I’m writing this rn because I was playing at game of fifa at 1 am on a school night (I’m at college in the uk and my timetable for the day doesn’t say I need to be in until 12:45). Anyway I hear my door creek open and see my little brother peeking through and I think to myself “fuck sake he’s gonna tell” but I was in the middle of a game with my mate. Sure enough after he closes the door my mam walks into my room and demands I come off the game now while my brother is standing behind her. (Bear in mind he’s done this god knows how many times before). The thing is why wake up my mum when she has work the next day as well as getting me in trouble. My mam literally said to my brother after he tried to act all smug “shut up and get to fucking bed” cos she was pissed that he woke her up when she gets up for work at 5:30.

Surely by this age he should have gotten out of the snitch stage but nah. He turns 15 in December and I genuinely have no hope of him changing any time soon. Is there any way possible that I could try getting him out of snitching on me. I never tell on him be he does it on me. I’ve tried talking to him about it but nothing works.

1khc908,I hate my brother - Need some advice?,Least_Ad3500,"I cannot stand my (F19) younger brother (M17).

For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers (F46) mental illness and various crises she's experiences and our fathers (M52) general absence. We don't have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me. To be clear, my brother, I'll call X for simplicity, has no known mental illnesses, disabilities, or other issues that would delay mental/emotional development. I have been diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and depression.

**My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house.** For context: My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard, all while doing nothing to assist. So this being the situation, it was expected that the kids, being me and X, would clean the house. However, for no known reason except X's own selfishness and presumed laziness, the chores would fall to me. If the house was not kept to a certain, and often unknown standard, I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment. I say ""no known"" because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however, my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X. Following suit, as we've grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me. My mother being in her ""free girl"" and ""spiritual"" ""era"" has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about. Being that I have OCD, one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough. I am also in my third year of University, currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85%.

I have explained to both my mom and X (I don't bother with my dad because he's not in the picture right not) how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes. Earlier today, the event that prompted me to write this, I was at work. Around 11:30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete, he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse. Typically when I message him he won't respond so he can claim he ""didn't see the text."" At 11:50 I messaged him again, reminding him of what was asked. I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded. I asked him kindly again to unload the dished. He told me to ""fuck off"" This is not the first time this has happened. I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house.

To be clear, this kid has school from 9-11, having a third period spare, meaning he has a 2 hour lunch. He is in grade 12 (or a senior, we are from Canada). When I was in grade 12, I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework. He sits of the couch and either a) sleeps or b) plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans (? not sure if that's what its called). I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called ""self-centred"" and from my mom I get a ""I will talk to him"" or a ""lay off of him."" In my opinion, nothing has changed.

I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store, which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues (which she fucking knew about) and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me. This job was also 30 minutes away from my house. I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time, it felt like the end of the world. So far X has looked for two jobs. One being at the end of his grade 11 year - this one was ""promised"" to him but fell through and is my moms words ""disappointed him and makes him not want to try again"" - and then again recently - dropping his resume off at a dollarama. It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school, keeping my grades above a 95% average (I know it was only high school, however it still took quite a bit of time and energy), working around 25 hours a week, and keeping the house clean. He has no job, is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes (I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes), and has no responsibilities around the house**My second issue is his choice of words.** He often uses slurs such as the r, n, f, I (the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada) and many more. He is a cis-het white male for any context. While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities, it is still incredibly harmful. I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world. He is unfortunately falling down the alt-right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it. He consistently refers to me and my mom as ""bitches,"" and to me as a ""fat fuck,"" or a ""slut/whore."" Again, words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views. I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst, where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now, let alone when I was 17, I would be screamed at.

**My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep.** Since I was in grade 4, I have been getting myself, X, and my mom up in time for school. My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk. So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up, feed the pets (Dogs and cats), let them out to play, make mine and X's lunch for the day, make myself breakfast (X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast), and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up. We are out the door by 8:25am. As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day. Thankfully, as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something (I still hate being late, let the record be known). However, I have not been in Gen-Ed for nearly 3 years now, and still have to wake X up. My mom thankfully has gotten better, however, she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X. I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby, turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession, beginning the process of waking him up at 7:30 to give him an extra half hour, pulling the blankets off him, spraying him with water (which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist), yelling, and using a very loud alarm. Nothing works. He never wakes up. I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5:30am. I am so fucking tired I don't even know what to do.

I don't know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop. I don't know how much I can take of this anymore. I just want to be a kid, and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can't keep doing this.",1,1,1746661742.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1khc908/i_hate_my_brother_need_some_advice/
1khc5i8,Should I file for child support?,Far-Plantain-4286,My childrens father and I split almost a year ago. He went from living in the home and being the primary parent while I was finishing school to literally never seeing the kids anymore. After he left everything was messy. He was with new girlfriend who he brought into our home and cheated on me which resulted in the split etc. She has 3 of her own and he was spending all his time between work and her and her kids. It became messy because I was on/off again sleeping with him as this was the only way he'd see our 2 and be helpful (i know thats pathetic on my part). About 2 months ago he told me she was pregnant and they were having a baby. I ended the extra side mess and was trying to figure out where our kids would fit into this since he wasnt seeing them consistently. We agreed to a schedule which he ended up going back on and on his weekend said he was dropping them off bc it was her birthday and he couldn't keep them overnight. Again this was a schedule we agreed on a month in advance. I said if he didn't keep them that I was going to tell her everything. He didn't keep them so I told her and filed for child support. He told me if i put him on child support that he would never see them again because he cant afford child support and i ruined everything for him and their happiness. Supposedly she wants nothing to do with him and he will have to file child support to see the new baby once its here and he wants to agree outside of court to an amount. I dont know if i should trust this as he threatens to sign over his rights every other week and now only wants to be helpful if i dont take him to court.

1khbm11,My mother drives me crazy,,"
I am a 30 y/o male. I have a 6 y/o son whose mother passed away about 8 months ago who I now care for by myself. Even before this traumatic event I have always had issues with my mother. One of my main complaints is that even when she appears to be helping me it is as if she is only doing it for her own self interest. If she watches my son for a night I will get 10 phone calls at 8am to come pick him up. Like how is that helpful. It stresses me out. I feel like I always have to change my schedule to accommodate her when I feel like she should be going out of her way to help me. Earlier today she called me about 3 times and when I did not answer she had my father text me to call her. It drives me crazy. I am in no mood to talk and if that is how I feel she will make me out to be the bad guy. She is also so bubbly and happy that me being in a bad situation and depressed it makes me not want to talk to her. She is very high strung which is the opposite of what I need right now.

1khaaux,Sister problems -Toxic sister????,Maleficent_Sea7446,"My sister and I are Twins. We shared a room until we were 16 and I started working. Throughout our childhood we had to wear matching outfits, matching hair etc. Basically treated as one child.
We are now 40 somethings and I have had enough of her. I moved out 27 years ago to get married. I took everything that was mine and left all shared items behind. She has now laid claim to several ornaments, books and photos. She won't take what I say as true and has a relentless belief that she is 100% correct.  She does stuff like this all the time. I posted about my distance learning ""graduation"" and she said she studied the same thing but with better scores, I told her I was depressed and she told me she was so badly depressed she tried to kill herself,  I got chosen to volunteer for something she wanted and she shouted out that I stole her place, it was random drawer, raffle style, so not sure how she thought that.
It's as if she thinks that she is worth more than me and feels I am not worth anything. Anytime anything good happens to me she comes up with a negative and if anything bad happens, she had the same thing happen but worse.
I am sick of it and honestly I have cut former friends out for exactly the same behaviour.  I don't know what to do. She is my sister and I love her, however this is getting to much for me.

1kh79rv,SIL whisks my daughter away right as my husband & I are about to leave with her.,sweetbabyshay,"Was at a family gathering at my husband's parent's house this past weekend. Things get intense, drama ensues for various reasons (just verbal drama), so we decide to leave. As I'm going to another part of the house to grab my shoes, I look around and am like, ""where did my kid go???"". I realize my SIL, who for some reason has never liked me, thought it would be a good idea to swoop my almost 4 year old up and take her to a totally separate part of the house, right as we are collecting our items to leave. Obviously this instantly enrages me, and also catches me off guard. So I guess, lesson learned - I can't take my eyes off my child for even 2 seconds while around my in-laws. My SIL then comes outside to our car & explains she was just trying to ""teach our child to punch a pillow when she's mad"". I'm taken aback, who tf does she think she is? Taking my child out of my sight, trying to ""teach"" her something? All while my MIL bursts into fake tears begging us to stay, while my BlL kind of just sits back and laughs. I'm so done, planning on having a detailed conversation with in-laws about establishing even more boundaries. I honestly have little interest in seeing them again. The cherry on top is that I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant, I have such little tolerance for extra stress. Dealing with my BIL's uncouth behavior is enough (propping his dirty feet on our dining room table, leaving crumbs around, not picking up after himself, just to name a few). Now I have to clap back at my SIL unexpectedly, in which our relationship is already strained from the very beginning, no matter how much l've tried to be cordial she still dislikes me. Atleast neither of them live closeby and they only visit a few times a year, but still. This past weekend has been the ""last nail in the coffin"" for me. 

TL;DR - Drama ensues at husband’s parent’s house. We decide to leave. SIL takes my daughter out of my sight as I’m collecting our items to leave, tries to parent my child, all while my MIL bursts into fake tears as a manipulation tactic, begging us to stay. This event solidified my disdain for my in-laws. ",32,9,1746648704.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kh79rv/sil_whisks_my_daughter_away_right_as_my_husband_i/

1kh5bxh,I am being bullied into deleting an app that earns 1.5k usd per month,No-Needleworker5288,"So I have built an app on my own that earns $1.5K USD per month. My brother also has an app that earns $5K USD in a similar category (parental control). He is physically and emotionally bullying me to delete mine.

The journey actually began in 2019. My brother was working at a company called [Company A]. They had a product called [App A] that he contributed to. After he switched to another company in early 2020, he had a lot of free time and built a similar product called [App B]. That app quickly became successful and started earning him around ₹3 lakh per month. This income helped him complete his master’s degree in France and buy a car, among other things. I observed all this from the sidelines.

In 2023, I decided to build a similar app called [App C]. I developed it entirely on my own, without copying anything from his work. Over the past six months, this app has started generating $1.5K USD per month. I analyzed multiple competitors, not just his app, and designed and developed all the features independently.

Now my brother is accusing me of copying his work and betraying him. He is demanding that I take down the app. I’ve invested a lot of time and money into building this, and I don’t want to be bullied into throwing that all away.

Unfortunately, it’s not just him—my entire family is pressuring me to remove it.",0,15,1746644012.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kh5bxh/i_am_being_bullied_into_deleting_an_app_that/
1kh572g,Auntie Mom,leedaleedaleedal,"So my (24f) sister (27f) has 2 kids (5f and 3m), I've basically helped raise them since they were born. Her baby daddy (37m) is useless and has other kids he also doesn't take care of. She had my nephew when their relationship was already messy. We ended up moving out together, where she also left me alone for some months to go back to him. I was broke af, struggling to pay rent by myself, and working alot/overtime/doubles. When they broke up for the last time we moved into another house which I went into debt for. I don't hold anything against her, she's done alot of work to be in a better place and now we don't live together anymore. (i have a bf (26m) live with now) 

My thing is I'm the only reliable person in our family for her, I babysit all the time and do things with them, I'll take the bus home with them if she can't pick us up from school (I work at their daycare). 

This past summer/year she's been dating again and going on dates, she tries not to ask me to watch them as much anymore because I've been vocal about valuing my own alone time. Also because of her work she does alot and goes everywhere. 

I'm honestly just tired of being the person who deals with other people's decisions. I never wanted kids, and now I'm basically a 2nd mom to them, I love them with my whole being. But they're also the product of her decisions to have kids with someone who was fairly shitty the whole time. I try not to be upset but sometimes my feelings about it bubble up and I get annoyed with her. I've also spent most of my life looking after other people's kids including my younger siblings and cousins. I'm just tired, I wish I could just go somewhere and not deal with anyone's problems.

1kh4swh,UPDATE: My husband tried to ruin my reconciliation with my sister,Fun-Wrongdoer1033,"This will be the final update to this situation. In short, we're going to get a divorce.

My (32M) husband (33M) is much worse than I thought he was. All of you who said I was in the wrong for giving him more chances? You were all right. Our relationship is beyond fixing.

After my last update I continued doing what I said I'd do: focus on my sister (24F) and on figuring myself out. I left my phone open for only my sister, both of my SILs (28 and 18F), and work. Things didn't get any easier and if anything, the letter my husband passed me and the fact that SIL2 read it and felt awful made everything worse and harder.

I still wanted to give my husband a chance. I love him. We've been together for twelve years. I wanted to calm down and talk to him. I wanted to ask that piece of shit why he told my sister to stay away from me and why he pretended to speak on my behalf. Even if it didn't change anything, I wanted answers. I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, I was hoping there was some explanation we could work through that didn't end in divorce. Anything*.* I love him. He was the first person I ever felt like I was at home with after leaving home at 18.

He's tried to get in contact with me multiple times through SIL1 and SIL2, but besides telling me ""(husband) is trying to get us to pass messages to you"" they didn't cooperate with him. I'm thankful for that. I wasn't in the mindspace to hear anything about him, I was too upset. Both of them are very angry at him too, specially SIL1, who can't forgive him for the horrific things he said about little siblings in the letter SIL2 read. SIL1 adores SIL2. She's trying to pretend reading that nonsense didn't hurt her too, but I'm sure reading her own brother say those awful things hurt her, too. SIL1's just the type to hurt silently.

To summarize a long story: on Saturday SIL1 called me and said my in-laws (MIL and FIL) needed to talk to me about my husband. And that even though I don't want to hear about him it was urgent. So I went over to their place and we had lunch together. SIL1 was there too.

After they found out about the entire fiasco after SIL2 read the damn letter they've been talking a lot to my husband. Apparently, he wasn't the good older brother he seemed to be his whole life. MIL and FIL told me that when SIL1 was born my husband wasn't happy with her. That's kinda normal for kids, but it appears he resented her and pretended she didn't exist for well into his teens. Same with SIL2 when she was born, and he was 15 by then. It seems like he's always, always been overly jealous of them and overly jealous in general. SIL1 never told me this because she thought her brother was over it and that it wouldn't affect me and our relationship now that he's an adult in his 30s. She was wrong (I'm not blaming her, he did seem remarkably normal when I met him, and I wouldn't have even suspected he was the one behind my sister's distance with me if SIL1 hadn't told me immediately.)

Anyway, besides being abnormally jealous of his little sisters, once he got to like them MIL and FIL told me my husband would go as far as to keep his friends away from the house and go out of his way to not invite them because he was scared his friends would like his sisters better than him, or that his sisters would like his friends better. MIL and FIL tried getting him to go to therapy when they found out, but he refused to talk to his therapist. SIL1 only found that out recently. She didn't know why she never got to meet her brother's friends.

After finding out his pathological jealousy was still in action when they found out about what my husband did to my sister when the whole situation exploded with the letter, they've been talking to him and prodding him to tell them why he felt so threatened by my little sister. While he was closed off at first he's always caved in to confiding in MIL. Basically, when he met me and learnt of my broken relationship with my family, he thought I was ""perfect because he would never have to share me."" He never said anything to this effect in the past twelve years. He's always expressed sympathy for my situation, and when I told him I wanted to reach out to my sister again he encouraged me. Retrospectively all this is terrifying.

The worst part is why he snapped when he did however. He told me it was because I had a sleepover with my sister on a night he wasn't supposed to be home and that I couldn't ""put my sister over my husband"". Apparently that was a lie. He told MIL the truth and this is what convinced me to divorce him.

A few weeks before the sleepover night, SIL1, SIL2, husband, my sister and I went out for drinks. We all overdid it a little, but I drank more than all of them and passed out on the table at the club before we left. While SIL1 and SIL2 were at the bathroom my husband asked my sister why she wasn't drinking and she confessed to my husband that she has a brain tumor. It isn't very dangerous for now and it doesn't interfere too much with her daily life (she's on epilepsy meds and that's mostly contained the problem) so she's on the ""watch and wait"" approach. Treatment will vary depending on if or when it starts growing and how quickly. She told him she was scared of telling me because, since I walked out on her when she was little, she's terrified that I'll walk out on her again if she ""becomes too much of a problem."" He promised her he'd help her tell me when she felt ready.

Instead, since he and I have been considering adoption for a while, he told MIL that he didn't want me getting ""distracted from *his* family"" if my sister's tumor progresses, and that it was ""better to get rid of her before she took all my attention."" Plus, that ""it would be cruel for *his* kids to get attached to their aunt if she's as good as gone.""

I broke down. When I calmed down enough I went home, packed some bags and got on the first flight to the country that bastard sent my sister running off to when he told her she was ""taking up too much space."" I basically appeared on her doorstep and hugged her the moment she opened the door. We spoke a lot over the weekend and I told her she isn't a problem. She put me up to date with her situation and told me she didn't want to ""be a problem"" and that she doesn't ""want to get between me and my family.""

The only person who got between me and my family was my exhusband. My sister did nothing wrong. I'm going to stay by her side come what may.

I had to be back home on Monday for work. I'm trying to get working remotely set up so I can move to my sister's city. I don't know how much time we have left before that thing starts growing. I hope it won't, but I'm not the most optimistic guy. Whatever happens I won't leave her alone. When I told her I wanted to stay with her she also broke down. I'm never leaving her again.

I've started talking to a lawyer for the divorce. MIL, FIL, SIL1 and SIL2 are all on my and my sister's side. My husband is dead to SIL1 and SIL2 after all that's happened, and MIL and FIL are still trying to get him to get professional help because he needs it. Before finding out the full truth I wanted to help him get help if he needed it too. While I still hope he gets his head sorted out and wish him the best, I can't be part of his healing journey even if part of me still loves him. Whatever is wrong with him he has to fix it far away from me and my sister, and his sisters too for the time being at least.

This is the final update. It ended in divorce. Considering everything, that's the part I care about the least.

Thanks to everyone who was kind, and to everyone who was rough and gave me a good dose of reality in the comments on the other posts. You all helped make me feel less lost during some very trying times. 

Tl;dr: my husband, who had tried to sabotage my reconciliation with my sister by telling her some awful things supposedly in my name, is a worse person than I thought. He hid that my sister has a tumor because he was afraid of how me supporting my sister would affect him. Naturally, I am working on a divorce and on moving closer to my sister.",36,6,1746642721.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kh4swh/update_my_husband_tried_to_ruin_my_reconciliation/

1kh2r5y,Having trouble not wanting to engage with my family,Chewhanluke,"28m here. I’m having trouble feeling guilty about not wanting to engage with my family. I’m not entirely sure where it stems from but I can go for long stretches of time without contact with anyone in my family. I really only start to feel bad when they come around wondering where I am or what I’m doing. They weren’t horrible to me growing up, but over the years I guess there’s been more distance as I go about my life with my partner and we do our own things in life. It’s just exhausting to me figuring out why I don’t want to see them. There have been several instances of them crossing my boundaries (albeit I had a hand to play in that by not knowing/stating my boundaries at the time), and just other micro aggressions towards my life choices. They remain supportive of me but don’t understand that I don’t mean anything personally against them by not seeing them, I just prefer being in my own space.

Any thoughts or similar experiences?

She gets good grade , good speaker , basically the perfect A+ student where as I , I’m just an average one . Few years back on my 13nth birthday we were celebrating my birthday at my home only because of covid and my sister had an exam the next day ( if it was my exam and her birthday we would have went out) I was warming the food , I picked up the hot glass bowl and it slipped out of my hand and fell on my feet , I was wearing flip flops . My foot was burnt but everyone was worried about the bowl , no one asked about my foot . Time skip to 2023 
It was morning when I was coming down the stairs and there was water on the stairs and I slipped. No one picked me up , they just started to scold me for not being careful. It’s been 2 years and my tailbone is still broken . I can’t sit for long on chair , can’t sit on floor , can’t sit properly on sofas . No one actually cares about me . 
Time skip to 2024 
It was around August or October. I was having some issues while walking, everyone said it was corn and told me to apply tape for removing it . I walked in that condition for 6 months , without any complaints , even if I said that I’m having pain they told me to suck it up and do my work . I use to go to school, walk dogs twice a day , go up and down the stairs . In April 2025 I told them this is enough and I need to get a surgery to remove this . During the operation the doctor said it was a Wart , he said it was 5 skin layers deep , the biggest he has seen . I got 3 anesthesia shots to numb it . Tho he said to take a bed rest for a week or soo.  my family members didn’t listen . I was going up and down the stairs to do their works - they called them small tasks . Anyways 
Last week my sister was going college and she slipped down the stairs , my father was on a call , he ended the call and rushed to help her , I was helping her already he move me aside and picked her up . Like if it was me not her I would have been scolded by then . My mother who came out of bath also rushed to help her . 
I have no problem, go help her but when it’s me the one hurt why do they behave differently with me . 
The don’t scold her for anything but if it’s me they give me an earful of scolding. 
Give me few tips on how to deal with this ",6,2,1746633564.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kh0yoj/aitah_my_family_doesnt_treat_me_right/
1kgygyv,Breaking the Cycle: A child’s fear of becoming what they survived,Objective_Habit4333,"I’m not here to compare traumas or romanticize the worst stories I see online—especially about fathers—but let’s be honest: some of us didn’t grow up with just “strict” parents. Some of us survived homes that felt more like battlegrounds than safe spaces.

Have you ever been beaten solid, cursed like you were nothing, just because you made a small mistake? Have you watched your father, drunk and raging, hurt your mom like it was routine—then turn around and act like he deserves your respect? As if you’re not his daughter, but his personal punching bag or slave? And still, he demands support, like you owe him something, while you're the one helping your mom raise your siblings and give them a future he never even tried to provide.

It’s sad that in many Filipino households, this isn’t even rare. Kids get whipped for not washing dishes, moms hide bruises behind plastic smiles, fathers waste money on sabong, alcohol, or other women—then come home demanding to be fed. And if they disappear, they come crawling back when they’re old and sick, expecting help from the same children they left behind.

Growing up in that kind of environment, I won’t lie—I’m scared to have a family of my own. I’m scared I might become what I witnessed. That trauma shaped me, and I’m constantly trying to unlearn it. I keep reminding myself: I am not my father. I am not my past.

I just hope—genuinely hope—that our generation, Gen Z and Millennials, break this cycle. That we raise our future kids with love, with healing, with boundaries, and without fear. Because I know I’m not alone in thinking, “I wish I was never born.”

No child should ever grow up feeling like that.",2,4,1746627424.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kgygyv/breaking_the_cycle_a_childs_fear_of_becoming_what/

1kgyfch,My dad disowned me,fuubutsushii,"(20F) I found out yesterday that I've been disowned. This was after I had an argument with my dad in a pharmacy, he embarrassed me by answering for me very loud in the back and making it clear to them I have some sort of speech issue (i don't, she didn't hear one number of my birth year but he still think I'm 11 and introverted). I told him to go outside and because I had some authority in my voice now he was embarrassed. We've never argued in public so it was worse in that sense but he made sure to call me every bad thing he could think of right there (in Arabic). My dad told my mom either I leave this Friday or he will. Of course it's not a question, even though he works maybe 14 hours a month my family depend on him emotionally and financially. But I just don't think what happened is enough ground to remove me. Just before that we were talking about the weather, and when I would take my driving test. Nothing leading up. It's true that we don't have the best relationship anyway, my dad spends most of his time saying I stink or my uni work is a waste of time because it's not a big uni or when I almost got married off in January (not willing) all the pictures I had were either catfish to him or ugly. Even said he'll have to stick a picture of you on the bedframe so he doesn't have to think about what lays next to him. And when I cried and complained he said it was all a joke of course. Somehow I should've known that.

Point is despite this rant I don't think I did enough to be disowned. I do see it as some misogyny because my brother has had similar or worse arguments and he never experienced some sort of silent treatment (I get this from my dad and my mom, the latter sometimes worse as she'd ignore me months at a time). Even in the house I've been confined to my room, I'm not allowed out for dinners or prayer, he doesn't want to see me. My mom was upset mostly because I didn't do enough.. I should've cried more begged more. But when he asked me to leave I did and I immediately started searching for my options. I have options already and I'm trying to get my benefits sorted so I can get into shared housing until I can find work as I only just finished uni and still haven't graduated. My two brothers have avoided me since. Worst part about this is I have a new baby sister that's 2 months, and having been an only girl my whole life I looked forward to raising her and seeing her grow and hear her call me sister. And I won't get that anymore.

What can I do right now, what should I be doing?

Edit: guess I got renowned, didn't have to go anywhere because my mom managed to convince my dad she'd need my help in the house with my sister to deal with because of course we ethnics don't teach our men about housework. So I'm back in under rules of a supreme maid; talk quietly, cook and clean without being asked or reminded and do everything as told. Mind you I said if you want a maid I'll hire one and ofc it got worse. But yeah with my financial status I'll be stuck here a little longer but thank you to everyone for the advice, I'll keep it in mind for next time soon enough <3",16,29,1746627309.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kgyfch/my_dad_disowned_me/
1kgyaf1,I don’t know what to do.,Excellent_Worker8115,"I don’t even know how to write this, everything caught up like a knot in my head.
Since i was a child, my mom most likely to break her promise. I understand it, if it has to do with money. But when it comes to relationship trust, she breaks it baddddd and i’m not okay with this. Since then i developed a trust issue with my mom. 

I always thanks her for her hardships, she is a strong person. She escapes us from poverty. 
But when i was a child, my life is literally nightmare. I used to have panic attack because of my mom and dad, they scared me so much. I always refer my dad as fire , my mon as oil and i am a fxcking burning meat. 

I can’t put my trust in my mom, She’s always twisted things. When I found out the truth, she will came up with excuses. I am so done with this. 

She makes me feel guilty, whenever we have a fight. I always feel like a villain in this family. 

It’s like a cycle, she hurt my feelings -> i keep my feelings to myself -> I can’t keep it anymore-> we have a fight -> i feel guilty bc I hurt her feelings -> i keep this guilt to myself -> she hurts my feelings again and then it goes like a circle. 

It’s tiring, i go through this many times.

She always ignore “red flag” in our family, she also ignore her own. And bc of this she doesn’t know how her actions affect me. I confront her about this and she doesn’t understand. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. What should i dooo???

.My parents divorced when we were 1, 3 and 5. They remarried and started new lives without us.  We were on the periphery, always looking from the outside in.
I grew closer to my dad as we got older, and he would randomly mention we were in his Will.....said he was a terrible dad and wanted to try make up for the time he wasn't there.  It was a topic I was too awkward to get involved with. He passed, and his wife recently passed. She changed the Will to exclude the 3 of us, just her 3 sons as beneficiaries. I wasn't surpised, she never welcomed us bit i had hoped his will was one where she couldn't change it.
He couldn't even do that.  The small amount of money would have made amends for the betrayal, misery and abandonment we felt as kids, creating childlike defenses to handle adult decisions. I just wanted my dad to be in my life.
Knowing that he simply didn't care enough is a reality that I have to acknowlesge. 
The childhood baggage of 45yrs, the silent wishes made for our mum and dad to love us, hoping that one day, I would have a father, daughter relationship. He never cared enough.....enough to protect us from their last twist of the knife. So I grieve losing him a 2nd and final time.

1kgop4z,I want to cut my sister off but our lives are so intertwined,Heavy_Challenge1154,"I want to cut my sister off because years she has projected onto me and this has made her disrespect me repeatedly and never apologize to me for it but rather turn it around scream at me for days expecting an apology out of me. I am now fed up because I usually apologize to her just so my life isn’t miserable because we live at home and we have a lot of the same friends. But she lives in this reality that every fight we get into is my fault and she must be allergic the the phrase “I’m sorry” she has started fights over the most simple things and it’s made me on edge because I can say the sky is blue and it could set her off.

My parents never actually tell her she’s wrong cuz they don’t want to “pick sides” and so they have enabled a lot of her disrespectful behaviour because even when I break it down to them what she did wrong they never say anything to her or tell her to change this consistent pattern.

Now in our most recent fight it included on of our mutual friend and that friend agreed with me the whole way though and said I was right and the way she treated me was wrong. I can’t be crazy since now a third party is seeing it. My sister screamed at our friend twice for not agreeing with her even tho our friend witness everything and is not biased just simply has her own opinion.

I have put my foot down with this fight and decided I am not gonna be a peacemaker and I expect an apology from her. (Which will never happen 🤣)

Now my mother is angry and told me to never speak to her because we’ve both made her life hell. I told her that she should have not enabled this pattern of hers and my mom agrees there’s a pattern because my sister has lost work opportunities for being rude to bosses when they’ve given her simple constructive criticism. She gets very disrespectful to just about anyone. But my mother goes “ well see when you have a daughter what you would do” like I’m obvs gonna tell them what they’re doing wrong unlike her approach 🤣

We have a bunch of the same friends and I just don’t care to be in any environment with her right now. We live together but I have a bought a lock and as far as I am concerned I see her as a roomate.

1kgocjw,How can I best support my sister and dad without letting my emotions weigh on them?,-CheeseLover69-,"Hey y'all, my family and I live in different countries and my sister has been in and out of hospitals since August. The past 8-9 month have been really challenging, as I have been worrying about my sister nonstop. I have a trip planned in a few days to go and visit, and plan to spend as much time with my sister and our dad as I possibly can. Dad has basically made her the center of his life, visiting her almost every day, hiring care staff when appropriate, driving her to the hospital, etc, and I can see he is worried and the has taken a toll on him (he is in his late 70s).

A friend asked me if I feel prepared to be faced with my sister's physical changes... and I realized I have never been in a situation like this. I have never seen someone I love so deeply, in such a vulnerable state, in person. She is currently unable to speak, only whisper a little, and barely able to write. She held her phone today, and that was a big step forward. Hope this makes sense... I am heartbroken for her.

A few years ago, after a close friend of mine had a near death experience, he sent us (his chosen family) a video explaining what had happen. He was frail, and didn't at all sound like himself. It was really hard and I was crying and heartbroken. But I was watching it alone, he wasn't there to see me cry, and I could then gather myself and be supportive via text or voice memos (again, different countries).

With my sister, I am afraid of having such an emotional reaction in front of her, and have it be another thing that weighs on her. I really want to be there for her and for our dad.

I am sorry if this post is all over the place... It is representative of my mine, I guess.

So please, if you have been in such a situation, on either side, and have any advice, I would love to hear it.

TL;DR: My sister has been in the hospital for over 8 months, my dad has been doing a lot to support her. How can I best support them without letting my emotions weigh on them?

1kglofz,My Father Lost His Mind and I Don’t Know How to Procceed,DraftMany925,"This post is going to come off a little trauma dumpy but I am very desperate for advice so just a little disclaimer in advance. (Edit: I go off on some tangents so please excuse my inability to just simply tell the story)
My father(42) for the last couple of years has been on the mental decline. At first it seemed like something you would see in someone much older, repeating questions or phrases several times in a row and not noticing. Having horrible memory, seemingly dropping intelligence significantly and all that. That gave me initially just the kind of slight annoyance you get with having to deal with that, especially of someone so young. But as the years went by it changed more and more alarmingly as time went on. 
The first I became aware of the changes was when I was roughly 19 or 20 (I am 21 now for reference) and he nearly killed me in a drunk driving episode. Context I got in the car with him (Not knowing he was drunk because he never really was a drinker) and immediately he started swerving down the rode. (Again didn’t think much of it because he always drives on his phone and is general a abysmal driver) But after side swiping a semi trailer and hitting a guard rail I became painfully aware of him drinking. I am a very reserved and shy person and hate confrontation so I didn’t say anything even after I knew, and became so terrified I started violently trembling. This led to him berating me about being scared of him when he noticed my trembling and even threatening me. Eventually he drove straight there the red light on a four lane intersection and that was the final straw until I threatened to call the police on him and he reluctantly handed over the wheel. I am summarizing a bit, but this was the day I truly started to put an assortment of events and things he’d done together and notice the decline of his mental stability.
After this transpired, he began to develop what I can only explain as the mind of a child. (Also Homelander from “The Boys” is a great representation of what he is like if you’ve watched the show) He developed in insatiable need to feel accomplished and loved by everyone around him while constantly treating everyone and everything like human garbage. I’ll give a couple examples. He makes dinner once every three months or so and when he finally gets everyone to eat he will force my family to say how good the meal was over ten times (sometimes more the most he ever forced my mother to praise him was nearly 15 times)by slamming the table and giving death stares until he is somewhat satisfied by our forced false praise.
Another example is my mother is a softball coach and my sister plays for the team she coaches. This is important because one obviously I want to support my sister so I would go to games to watch her. And every single game I swear to you for hours and game after game he would do nothing but complain about my mother not “acknowledging” him sitting in the stand when she is in the middle of coaching a team of young teenage girls during a game. And he would complain and complain about how no one cared about him because people who pay attention to my sister during her own softball games. 
On the topic of my sister he is extremely misogynistic and is very demeaning of women in general. Does not comprehend periods and will belittle my sister for simply using women hygiene products that kind of behavior. 
This will be a final example to kind of illustrate the picture to what kind of a person he is but I have two wonderful dogs who are unfathomably intelligent. (Border collies) So admittedly they are much more behaved than a normal dog. Completely understand any command you give them will come back in the house if you call for them that kind of thing. But despite them being so well behaved it isn’t enough for my father who began to hit them for “misbehaving” even though they have rarely so much as have an accident. (My one dog has seizures, not because of brain damage he caused, but goes to show he is willing to hit an epileptic dog. ) This caused my one dog to cower and hide from him at every opportunity and this enrages him. Going back to needing to be constantly showered in praise and affection while treating everyone like garbage. 
I know I said last example from the past but I’ll give another while I’m thinking about it treating others like garbage but expecting everyone to love him. He will make quick comments like another story but he has gone up to my sister and said phrases along the lines of “You’re horrible at softball, or you have no friends” (Elementary school bully behavior) and will immediately go to another tangent and expect everyone to happily listen and talk with him as if he didn’t insult the person he was talking to.


Now you probably get an idea of how he’s been acting in the past. I’ll fast forward to the last week and his life is seemingly more of the rails than ever. He now talks to himself will make sounds for no reason, he’ll stand and shake like a psychotic movie character. Every sentence he speaks is like speaking to either an 8 year old or and 88 year old no sentence really means much of anything. But on Friday he quit his job completely left everything at our job site and just quit. (We work the same job unfortunately) There was no planning no nothing my mother didn’t know I didn’t know, I learned from a text he sent my coworker that he completely quit. He spent the first couple days mindlessly scrolling YouTube shorts and today he was drunkenly sprawled out on the living room floor making noises.  Also he yelled at me for beginning to cook dinner because he wanted hot dogs and I should have know that’s what he wanted. But now that I am at this point I am completely dumbfounded on what to do. I am 90% sure he has psychosis or something along the lines of it. (My sister insists he is bipolar which she is right)  Now the problem is my mother has been a stay at home mom  since before he started going off the deep end and is still that. Which means I am the only one in the house with a job as a 21 year old guy. My father basically burned every bridge he had at his last job and is now too mentally unwell (at least I think) to ever be hired somewhere else. And now I’m finding hundreds of dollars worth of lottery tickets, alcohol, fast food of his just laying around. He is also seemingly becoming more violent. I came up with an excuse last Friday to not ride in to work in the same car as him because of trauma and all that but I put on a happy face and gave a legitimate excuse. This caused him to not openly show it but he stood in the doorway eyes bulging and body twitching and as I was getting ready I heard him under his breath say “I’m going to fucking murder him” over something as trivial as that 


So the conclusion to my book, (Or for anyone unwilling to read the entire story which I understand) My father who is almost definitely psychotic left his job, is becoming increasingly unstable and potentially violent, basically ruined every relationship and opportunity he has in life. Leaving me to one just wanting to get out of the house and leave and never come back. But I’m terrified of what might happen to my sister or mom if he continues to worsen. Not only am I scared he may become violent to them. I’m terrified I’ll have to financially care for them if he snaps. I do have 45k saved up from working full time since high school. Which seems like a lot at first but to start a new independent life and care for my family seems impossible to me. Also, I have never confronted him about his behavior  because he is severely depressed and I feel like if confront him about his behavior he will legitimately kill himself. So I can’t get him to see anyone about his mental stability to fix our problems that way without him crashing out on me for even suggesting it. And I truly am at the point where I know it’s wrong to feel this way but I do not have any want or incentive to help him anymore. It feels like a waste of my time. So I suppose I’m just very lost. I’m terrified  for my sister and mother’s future and don’t know how to escape this chapter of my life. If anyone has experience like this I would love to know your approach. Also I’m skipping out on a large amount of details and events so if there is context I left out in my rambling then let me know please.

However, around 5 years ago when visiting my half-brother, my dad said something to piss him off, he freaked out on him, they got in an intense punching fight while I was sleeping and we left the next day. We didn't hear from my half-brother for like 4 years, however they had apparently reconciled during that time. Anyways, fast forward and my 16 year old cousin committed suicide. Over the years my half-brother and one of my cousins family on my dad's side had gotten very close with one another, and the kids would frequently visit him every summer for a couple weeks. My half-brother contacts me and shares the news with me first, and we got back in touch ever since, chatting every week or so. During this period, he and my dad tried to reconcile as well and went on a family vacation. 

During this vacation, allegedly, my dad was extremely drunk the entire trip, and consistently made vulgar and transphobic comments towards my brother the entire trip. Apparently he would walk around the apartment with his dick out, disturbing my brother. When my brother called him out on it, he made vulgar comments to him, waved his dick around in his robe and taunted him. From my Dad's side, again, allegedly, my half brother was the issue. He walked around the apartment, would not put up his robe, and let his boobs hang out the entire time in front of my dad and his friend. They were disgusted by it, told him to cover up, and he refused.

Ever since then they have both hated each others guts. Here is where I fall into play. I have stayed on great terms with my half-brother at least on his end. He constantly says how much he loves me, is glad we have stayed connected, and ""can't wait until my dad dies and we can take all his money"". Yeah I'm not all about that. My dad has stated numerous times my half-brother is not getting anything, its all going to me, etc.

  
However, further caveat, we have no idea if he has even created a will or not. As of the time he and my mom split up 4 years ago, he did not have a will. He claims to have made one, but it never goes past ""it's taken care of"". No proof of anything. (We highly doubt he does). We highly suspect its not, and as a result, the will is going to be split between everyone.

With all that being said, fast-forward to the past 2 months. My half-brother called me and told me that my half-sister (the crackhead) was recently manipulated (she has severe mental disabilities due to excessive meth usage) and taken out of a hospital by a creep with multiple sexual assault charges who took her back to his place in the middle of the woods and raped her. This is someone who I have not had any contact with for 15+ years outside of family funerals where she was strictly prohibited by my parents from talking to me.  My half-brother used this to get in contact with my dad’s side of the family and basically guilt-tripped my dad into taking her in. He spent over $1,000 getting her out—paying for Ubers, hotels, etc. Apparently every six months she calls him begging for help because she gets kicked out of shelters either for A) relapsing or B) having seizures from her epilepsy (he claims shelters won’t take her because of the liability, I’m skeptical). But anyway, he used this situation to pressure the family until my dad agreed to take her in. She’s been staying with him for the past couple weeks.

Also worth mentioning: I have a full brother (22M) who’s autistic and is not aware of any of this however, he loves my half-brother and hates my dad. I will fully admit my dad plays favorites, has clearly established me as his favorite, and for the most part ignored my full brother because he cant relate to him due to his autism. I'm in no way saying I believe my dad is either a ""good"" or ""bad"" person.

My dad keeps saying he’s not leaving my half-brother anything, but if there’s no will, that’s probably not enforceable. Meanwhile, my mom keeps telling me I need to protect myself. She believes my dad’s version of events more than my half-brother’s, thinks he exaggerates a lot, but admits some parts are probably true. She’s also convinced he’s going to try to guilt me or pressure me into giving him money if/when my dad passes and the inheritance is settled (don't need to convince me I already know this is going to happen). She also is really pissed at my dad because if he doesn't have a will, she knows I am going to have to go through hell dealing with both my half-brother and especially my half-sister who is a wild card. She basically told me ""You are the only responsible one left and they are both going to come after you for money the second dad dies"" which I fully realize and agree with her on (thank god she is a stable, good person and a badass mom).

At this point, im stuck in this mess and will have to deal with it one day, whether or not thats in 6 months, 6 years, or 20 years (he drinks to much to make it that long to be real). . I care about my half-brother and we’ve stayed close, but I’m really worried that not giving him money will end the relationship or turn him against me. Even worse, I know that he will very likely use that information to turn my entire dad's side of the family against me, who some of them I do really like, I just haven't had the opportunity to know them due to completely separate family drama. At the same time, I don't owe my half-brother anything, I am not responsible he and my dad's emotional instability. Im not responsible for my dad having a one night stand and my half-brother being completely unaccepting of the fact that his biological father for the most part wants nothing to do with him. 

  
Alot of this is me venting, but really I just want some outside opinions. I really don't know how to handle this. Is it even possible to have a relationship with my half-brother while knowing the second I get an inheritance its either pay up or have him hate me for life? Am I just delaying the inevitable? Is it even possible to stay close to him?

TLDR: I’m the “favorite” kid stuck in the middle of a chaotic family. My half-brother expects inheritance money when my dad dies, but I know giving him nothing could destroy our relationship and turn my distant family (cousins, aunts uncles) whom I like against me. Not sure if staying close is even possible without paying up.",2,4,1746579066.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kgkpht/my_halfbrother_expects_to_be_receiving_money_when/
1kgkg4z,I was on family vacation and caught my cousin... relieving himself while sleeping next to me.,Soggy_Dot_4323,"This happened about a week ago, but I feel like I am traumitized because of this and if I don't talk about it then I'll never get over it.

To make a long story short, I live in Orlando and I had my whole family come visit so we could have a fun weekend at Universal Studios. In total, we were a group of eleven and had to rent an Air BnB. I am a resident in Orlando so I could have slept at my own place, but my family insisted I stay at the Air BnB with them. 

Sleeping arrangements were tight at my parents were there, my aunt and cousins, my sister and her husband and their two kids. All of the bedrooms were taken so I opted to sleep on the living room couch. 

Here is where things get weird. My cousin (who is younger than me) asked if he could sleep in the living room with me since there were two different couches. I told him sure since I didn't see the harm in it. But boy was I wrong.

I woke up randomly at 5am since I have insomnia, and I hear sounds. The kinds of sounds a woman does not want to hear in the middle of the night. Well I look up, and my cousin is just laying on the couch next to me, pants down and just full on doing the deed. 

I didn't know what to do so I just pretended to stay asleep. I didn't want to embarrass him and I also didn't want to have this really awkward conversation with him about it. So I laid there pretending to sleep and just have to force myself to listen until he finishes. And as soon as he's done he just GOES BACK TO SLEEP! 

But I can't wrap my mind around why he would do that while I'm in the same room as him. Like, at least go to the bathroom or something but my god. I am traumatized for life now and I feel objectified a little.",5,13,1746578291.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kgkg4z/i_was_on_family_vacation_and_caught_my_cousin/

1kghmy0,"My son didn’t mean it as a compliment, but I’ll never forget it",SharingMyCaring,"I got the most subtle, offhand and meaningful compliment from my son, and he had no idea it was happening.

My son who's in college was sharing a story about a night he and his friends were hanging out, bored, just talking. The topic turned to punishments they’d gotten as kids. Someone said they were grounded for two weeks. Someone else lost their phone and others lost access to their video games. The list went on.

My son didn’t say anything. He said he just sat there listening. Eventually, one of them asked him what his punishments had been.

And he said, “I don’t know. I was never really grounded. It's not like I was spoiled or anything, I got yelled at for stuff, but nothing major. I guess my parents explained stuff in a way that just made sense, so I didn’t really see any reason in going against them. So, I guess I don’t really have a story.”

And for someone who was just winging it and doing the best they could, this might be the best compliment I’ve ever received. I felt so validated and overjoyed and proud, and the best part about it was, there was no intention for that to be a compliment. He didn't realize how impactful that single innocent story really was.

Anybody have any stories of receiving unexpected validation from your family?

1kggsqf,Aita for being upset with my father over birthdays ?,LetterheadAlert2974,"So I m 23f and my father is 53m .
Since I was a kid I have loved birthdays. 
Even if it is something simple .
I like dressing up getting a nice cake making a cute back drop for pictures and also going out to eat dinner .
So it starts with my 19th birthday covid had just ended and 3 of my friends came home to surprise me .
All my family was also there . My grandparents uncle aunt cousins .
But my father had gone out for some work .
I waited for him to cut my cake he didn't come back home .
Mom called him and told me he was busy .
And later I found out he was helping out his friend plan for his daughter's wedding menu .
I was very upset . Cried a lot and didn't talk to him . Then came my 20th I was already in university by then and just came home for my birthday. 
It started nicely he got me a cake to cut at midnight . I ordered a nice cake for the actual birthday. 
And I told him I just want to go out for a dinner just the 4 of us . My dad , mom , me and my little sister. 
I like going to nice small restaurants because they serve nice food. 
I don't like 5 stars or 7 stars because the food is bland and you can't talk loudly or enjoy .
They have classical music in the background which also I don't enjoy . Still I let that go .
And them I find out he had invited his friends and business partners to ""surprise me"" mind you they are people I don't even like . All I wanted was a quiet dinner with my family. And in order to attend his guests we didn't even get to talk all the time. I don't even have a picture of the 4 of us. 
Now comes my 21st again because I love my birthday cakes I designed it myself ordered it .
And I got an idea my family was planning something. So I gave them subtle hints about which people I would never want on my birthdays. 
Again it started of nicely . Even my bestfriend came home to wish me . The thing they told me was that we will yo out for a family dinner my grandmother, parents ,my uncles family , me my sister and my elder cousin. 
When we reach at the location it's a huge party .
With all of my fathers side of the family , his friends and business partners and also the people I told them I don't like . And none of my friends was invited . One of them I know has tried to touch me and my sister and looks at my mom weirdly . I had told my father this but he didn't listen to me . And still invited him .
Again it was a huge party so it didn't affect me that much. 
But here it comes . I looked at my birthday cake it was beautiful. I click pictures with it . And when I go to cit my cake this girl around 7 to 8 years old the relative of that same guy whom he brought with himself without being invited . Holds the knife and wants to cut the cake .
I look at my father and he is like let it be . I get really upset and just leave to see the only relative from my mom's side of the family who had just arrived. And later he scolded me for over reacting and leaving from there . He said that she was just a child and if he asked that child to move away it could have made the man unhappy and he wouldn't risk his relationship with that guy for a cake .
But it was a big deal for me .
Then comes my 22nd birthday the worst of all of these .
I made a sketch of the cake I wanted . And I was going to order it but my father told me that he will do it this time . I was not feeling good about it but I let him because he does not like being told no .
He called me a day before and asked me what I want to do and who I want there .
I told him about a new place that had opened up and I like it . And just our family and one of my cousins family there .
The place I liked was a roof top cafe which had a nice vibe and good music .
I especially told him that I did not want to go to a fine dine five star hotel .
I was having a very bad day because my best friend had not wished me and was feeling very sad . We leave home he picks up the cake at the last moment and takes a long time there . We reach and it's a five star hotel and again other than the cousins family there are two other families who I don't even know .
I was having a bad day and I start getting upset. 
It was again the classical music and bland food .
So he starts telling my uncle that I am so ungrateful. And how he does so much for me but I never appreciate him . Mind you I always appreciated his efforts even if I didn't like it . And then comes the breaking point I wanted to take pictures of the cake for my instagram and I open the box and it was a random cake . Mind you didn't even have my name on it . Not even the flavor I told him .
I don't know what happened I started breaking down and I leave the table quietly and ho to the washroom and cry . My cousins and my sister follow me .
And later I cut that cake just so that the others don't feel bad .
He didn't even give me an explanation for why he did that .
Coming to my 23rd I decorated my room myself ordered my cake and just asked my parents to come home before 12 as my sister was at her university and I would be alone at home . They went out to celebrate a friend's birthday. 
They don't come home until 1 o clock in the  night and I was alone. 
And just because I told him that he always finds a way to spoil my birthdays and that he can never even do the bare minimum he got upset and didn't even wish me . Although he did post on social media . To show people what a doting father he is . All I had previously asked was a bouquet of my favorite flowers and he didn't get them for me . I spent the whole day crying in between the calls I got from my family and friends and trying to sound normal so that no one gets to know I m upset. 
I didn't even get a hug from my parents that day 
I travel for my birthday every year for 8 hours to come home . And that's what I get. 
My mom tries her best she takes me to the salon gets me cloths gets my nails done .
But she never speaks against my dad .
I m tired of this.  I was once the girl who loved birthdays and now I hate them .
I just want to know if I am in the wrong.
Am I behaving like a brat .
Am I the AH.",1,2,1746568215.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kggsqf/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_father_over_birthdays/
1kgew3y,"I wanted to settle in my grandparents’ old weekend/vacation place, but some of my family members didn’t agree.",Glass-Complaint3,"I started looking after my grandparents' old weekend mountain farmhouse after they both could no longer drive and were struggling with mobility issues (and dementia for my grandfather). I loved the house ever since I was a kid and I was really so happy there. I loved the area and community too. However, some of my family members (my dad and uncles) didn't always take kindly to my being there and wanting to settle in there. They'd always tell me things like ""it's not your house,"" and I always told them to never say that to me again. That never left a good taste in my mouth because while I understand I didn't technically own the place, I was one of the family members and trying to carry on the tradition. They'd always say ""we have professionals doing those things"" rather than thanking me (I was doing it for free). We all had over 20 years of fond memories there. My dad eventually came around about me someday inheriting it and settling there longterm. However, some of my uncles still weren't convinced. One of them once asked me, ""would you be open to moving to your own place up here?"" And I told him no, because the whole point of me being there was to be in THAT house, and it would ruin it all. Once again, he pulled the ""not your house"" card. I also added a couple of instruments there, being a musician, and he was PISSED at me for this. He was telling me how appalled my grandfather would be, etc. Within the last year or so, my dad & uncles started making many changes to the place that were really starting to take away its character. I didn't like this, and eventually I said, I've had enough. I figured with the rate things were going, in 5 years the place would be barely recognizable. At this point I think it may be better to sell the place honestly. Oh and BTW, my grandmother LOVED that I was up there, living in the place for a time and later checking in on it since she's no longer able to do so. They always told me I was being ""bitchy"" when I'd ask them not to tell me it wasn't my home. That's not bitchy, that's standing up for myself. Did I act too ""entitled"" for thinking it was the perfect place for me due to the family ties and all the years of memories? And I went up there and checked in on the place when NO ONE else in the family even offered to.

She is 62 and has been very financially irresponsible in her adult life. In addition to that she is in constant pain. She is overweight and has not taken care of herself and as a result can barely walk. She has many issues with feet/knees/shoulder, etc. She has multiple surgeries including knee replacements. However, she never did physical therapy correctly thus the pain. She numbs her pain with drinking. I have kids and I definitely do not want her around. She has made comments about how it will be great when she moves in and I can help her (she even suggested I could do her hair). I work full time, have kids, and pretty much take care of everything in the house as my husband travels a lot. I feel like its not my responsibility to take care of another fucking adult. She guilts my husband a lot and basically emotionally manipulates him. He feels like its our responsibility to help. Where the hell do I go from here?

He swore it was just emotional (talking, texting, pictures) and I doubted him after all his lies but he’s stuck with it.

1kg5gle,How often do you see your parents as an adult? (Advice needed!),Mindless_Show4841,"For context: I was estranged from my parents for a few years due to how controlling they were and how they treated my husband when we were dating (I was in my mid-twenties at the time). I recently reconnected with them and for the most part it’s been going well (although they never fully apologized for their past behavior). I have a kid now and they love seeing him. They live about an hour away from me (one way) and I drive over 2 hours round trip for work 4 days a week. 

It first started out as me going over there once a week just to catch up on missed time, but somehow it has become expected that I come over every Sunday. My visits at their house were 7-8 hours long at first (not including driving), and I’ve since been able to cut it down to about 4-5 hours (still not including the drive), although they weren’t thrilled about that. My husband doesn’t come for the weekly visits because it’s just too long of a day for him, so that’s one less day he gets to see our kid on the weekends. There are some weeks where they are busy Sundays and expected me to come on Saturdays but I had to tell them no that those are the days we try to do stuff with our kid or usually have other plans already. This was met with some backlash but hasn’t been too much of a problem since. 

Recently my mom told me that she feels like they aren’t a priority and that we put my in-laws/husband’s family first and see them more. For context, my in-laws live just down the road from me, so of course I see them more but for shorter periods of time. And my in-laws don’t ever expect us to be there for 5-8 hours or come over every week, and are good with respecting that we are a young married couple with our own lives and that sometimes plans change. They also have been very good to my husband and I since we started dating. (Side note- my mom also didn’t see why I need to see my MIL on Mother’s Day and insinuated that cause she’s my mom she should come first.)  

Setting boundaries with my parents/mom as an adult has always been an issue, and towards the end of me living with them they got very controlling over how and who I could spend my time with (they’ve been like that my whole life, it just came to a boiling point where I had enough and stood up for myself). I love my parents, but doing that long of a drive 5 days a week with work included is becoming a lot. I talk to my mom on the phone for multiple days a week on my drives, and text her as well so it’s not like she doesn’t hear from me.

I just want to see how often adult children visit their parents and if maybe I’m being unreasonable with wanting to see them maybe twice a month, or that I shouldn’t be expected to give up my Saturdays because they can’t see me on a Sunday. Any advice/thoughts appreciated! ",2,9,1746540648.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kg5gle/how_often_do_you_see_your_parents_as_an_adult/

1kg3fgj,Needing advice about my mom,Detteri,"Let me start by saying that I'd love my mom's and my relationship to be like we're best friends, but her behaviour is driving me up a wall and is, in my opinion, the factor that makes that sort of relationship impossible. Of course, she might say that my behaviour is worse, but then she's not the one making this post. 

I feel like my mom treats me like a child or like a dummy all the time. It's not a weird childish voice that she does (like I've read other OP's moms do), but more the things that she says. For example, constantly asking if I've done something really obvious, like 'have you switched the kettle off?' or 'have you closed the fridge door?', or 'put your alarm on, you'll oversleep!' (I haven't overslept anything for at least 15 years). It's always something stupid, that a person would need to be an absolute colosal idiot to not do as part of the normal functioning, and it is constant. Now, everyone has brain farts, that's normal, but on the whole I don't consider myself to be stupid, I've always had excellent grades, finished university, been fully independent since then, moved to another country, made a carreer, bought a house from my own money, etc., so pretty normal functioning adult with a brain. Yet, the way she talks to me is as if I was with a mental handicap and required her constant assistant or guidance, the things she'd say are, to me, the equivalent of telling a 31 year old to, for example, not eat dirt. 

When I ask her to stop talking to me like I'm an idiot, she goes off on her tangent starting to cry, shout and wail how 'it's impossible to say anything to you, you always act like a wild animal jumping on me, it's your own problems and your insecurities, if you're thinking that I'm talking to your like you're an idiot, bwaaahahwaaa, you need to go to therapy, I will not talk to you at all then, that's it, that's the last time I say anything to you', etc. Then she does a massive guilt trip by being sulky for the rest of the day, until I FEEL GUILTY that MY feelings were hurt and I expressed them, and I NEED to apologise to her in order for normal relationship to resume.

But then there's also an aspect of my physical appearance. Now my mom has been cheated on by my dad so many times throughout their married life, and me being the only child and a daughter I feel like there was always some sort of resentment coming from her towards me and my relationship with my dad (which I'd call normal, nothing excessive or very close). God forbid I'd call my dad first, then her, I'd listen to a rant about how 'father is always more important to you, of course, you don't need to call your mother, only father is in front of your eyes'. This, of course, would then lead me to say 'Of course not, mom, I love both of you, lalala'. 
There were periods in my life where she's be insisting for me to cut my hair off, because long hair is 'ugly on me and looks like spaghetti' (she's had a pixie cut all her life). Or she'd tell me at 8AM to 'stop eating, this is why you're fat, because you stuff everything into your mouth'. Now this was said after I threw a sweet (one!) into my mouth first thing in the morning. 

She's incredibly patronising, always offers unsolicited advice (I regret to say that there was never a situation where I genuinely needed her advice and felt that she could truly offer one), and then when I respond that this is not what I will do, he comes back with 'of course, your mother is an idiot, she doesn't have any experience, why should you listen to me... I will not say anything to you, go to your father for advice then or do what you think you know best...' This rant would always be in a bitter tone, never in a normal 'ok, gotcha' sort of tone. 
Part of that appearance issue is her giving compliments. It's either nothing, or incredibly pushy rant for me to buy/put on something she suggested, or a back-handed compliment, like 'oh you look no nice! I love this on you!' followed closely by '...It's good you changed your looks a bit, I was already bored of green colour on you'. Or she'd buy me a clothing item (despite my very explicit repeated instruction to NEVER buy me clothes), the item would be in a most ridiculous green seen to man, and she'd be like 'but you love green', despite the fact that she's never once in my life seen me wear that shade of green.

And the list goes onnnnn and onnnn, I don't know what to say or not to say to her anymore, but my resentment is now on such a level that I'm seriously considering going to therapy and getting a journal, despite the fact that I've never had one in my life.

1kg1tml,My Sister - The Grandma in the Window,Afraid_Service_5655,"Hello everyone! I have a mild rant as you will see below about my sister. For context I’m 26, college educated and married. My husband and I moved across the country last year as well. My sister is 18, just finishing high school and has no plans of college or working…

…which leads me to my first point. She’s just graduating high school with no desire for college or work. I understand being indecisive at 18, but just wanting to rot away on my parent’s house? That is really sad to me. I tried taking to her and my parents about this but they both tell me that just because I liked school doesn’t mean that my sister has to follow in my path - and I agree. But just sitting on the couch for your life doesn’t seem all that great either.

Second, my whole family communicates mostly through texting since we live so far away. My sister only, and I mean only, texts me to tell me about crime in my hometown, what she saw on the Nextdoor app, or how many police cars she saw while out and about. I love my sister but this is honestly starting to piss me off and I don’t want to talk to her because of the constant news reporting. I tried talking to her about other topics and even voiced that I don’t really have any interest in the hometown news. She then just ignores me.

A while ago, my dad remarried and moved to Germany with his new wife. We used to all get along pretty well when we were living together, but ever since they left, things have changed.

His wife now frequently criticizes how I live, things like my cleaning habits, fingerprints on the fridge, cat hair on furniture, and other small stuff. When they're coming from Germany, I always deep clean our house. She also expects me to share my location with my dad when i travel, which my own parents never asked of me before. Her kids are used to that, but I wasn’t raised that way, and it feels like she’s trying to impose her lifestyle and rules on me.

I doubt that my dad would ever ask her kids to do the same things she’s asking of me. It makes me feel like I’m being held to a different standard just because I’m his daughter and not hers.

1kg0bzy,AITAH (22M) for not letting my girl’s (25F) relatives live at our house?,Plastic_Airline8672,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language, sorry. I’d be happy to clarify and fill any gaps if there are any 

It all started last 2023 when her nephew was sort of welcomed into our house, along with my gf’s sisters. 

I have no means to provide for 5, so my family had to extend their financial support to feed, clothe, and maintain a certain lifestyle. My mom noticed that it’s getting kinda abusive on our end, especially the fact that they bring absolutely nothing to the table. On top of that, my gf always has the last say at home, despite everything.

Sometime around 2023 I quite convinced her that it’s time for her sisters and her nephew to move out since we’re both gonna work (we were customer service reps) and we had absolutely no time to look after kids.

Fast forward to mid 2024, I found an offsite job which allowed me to work at home. This was the time when she had attempted again to have her sisters stay with us, given that her sisters’ dad’s (they have different dads) child support will be used to sustain their needs, which wasn’t the case. 

Fast forward now, she is yet again making an attempt to have her nephew live with us again. Where is her nephew’s parents you ask? His dad is a delivery rider and his mom is a pharmacist. They have NO INTENTIONS of giving financial support for their kid, and I am again gonna be somehow forced to look for another source of income just to sustain their lifestyle.

1kfzaau,When to tell my 18-year-old son I’m not his biological father,Then_Equipment_5671,"When to tell my 18-year-old son I’m not his biological father (seeking advice)

Looking for some honest advice or experiences from anyone who’s been through something similar.

I met my wife when her son was just a year old, and I’ve raised him as my own ever since. We later had a daughter together, and the bond I have with my son is incredibly strong. He’s always known me as “dad” — I’ve been there for every milestone.

When he was younger, especially around ages 10 to 14, he struggled a lot with school, anxiety, and depression. Because of that, my wife and I decided not to tell him I’m not his biological father at the time — we didn’t want to add more confusion or pain.

Now he’s 18. But he’s still dealing with severe depression and anxiety. We’re supporting him the best we can, but emotionally, he’s in a fragile place.

Lately, my wife and I have been wondering if we should tell him the truth — mostly out of honesty and concern that he might find out from someone else someday. But I’m terrified of how it might affect him, especially right now. I love him deeply, and I never want him to feel like that love isn’t real. Because it is.

Has anyone had to go through this? Is there ever a good time? Should we wait until his mental health improves? Really struggling with this and would appreciate any advice.",27,29,1746519524.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfzaau/when_to_tell_my_18yearold_son_im_not_his/

1kfy45d,My mother has ruined my engagement and is on track to ruin my future marriage,Responsible_Bake3941,"I (22 F) and my fiancé (24 M) just got engaged about 2 months ago after being together for a year before that. Since the very beginning of our relationship, it has been a constant uphill battle with my mother (62 F). Now, it is to the point where my fiancé is outright refusing to have her at the wedding. Let me explain.

After my now fiancé and I began dating, I began to tell my mom about him, since I was obviously excited about this new relationship. Some of her biggest gripes were that he’s nothing more (in her mind) than a backwoods redneck, and essentially that I’m too good for him. But the biggest thing that has been the nail in the coffin is that him and his family used to be long-time Jehovah’s Witnesses. Ever since I told her this, she has held onto it and used it as ammo in every single argument me and her have had. 

Example A: She asked me if my fiancé did any sports growing up. I told her no, it really wasn’t his thing, and that he always just loved and enjoyed doing the dirtwork/construction that he does now, and never took much of an interest in sports. She clutched her pearls at this because of course he hasn’t done any sports, since he couldn’t do anything that would put him around being people that weren’t JW (I know this is true within the religion, but this is NOT how they operated growing up and they left the church when he was still relatively young). I’ve tried to explain this as not true, but she simply won’t accept it.

Example B: I was previously living in a major metropolitan city that I despised living in. After dating for almost a year, I moved to his small town that I had fallen in love with after consistently visiting every single weekend during that time frame because I never wanted to be where I was living. Ever since I’ve moved, and especially after I told her about our engagement, all she does is say that I’ve been “sucked in”. She’s convinced I’m in a cult. She’s also said she hates my ex boyfriend (who cheated on me) to his guts because he did this to me and made me latch on to the first guy I could get after him.

Example C: Since starting working post-college, I’ve found that I hate the field I ended up going into (fundraising), and I haven’t completely burnt out from doing it and the pressure I have felt from being responsible for holding up an entire organization while having no direct experience with major fundraising before. I’ve expressed interest in living a more traditional way of life, like working a part time job still relevant to my field instead of a full time corporate gig and spending more time in the home, since I have learned that cleaning, cooking, and decorating, are all things I really enjoy doing in upkeeping a home and just serving my fiancé overall. She says I’m on track to be the most controlled woman and is disappointed I’m not taking the corporate career route like she did and subject herself to misery for 20 years. She admitted a while back that she always envisioned I would move back down to where we were from, even after I had said many times I didn’t want to put roots down where I was from because I wanted to find somewhere new, and find a nice boy down there to settle down with.

Example D: Since announcing our engagement, she has told me that me getting married young like I am is her second worst nightmare. When I told her our initial wedding date, she asked why we were rushing it. I told her we just didn’t feel the need to wait and were really excited about getting married. She grilled me and said I must be pregnant, and what happened to having a long engagement? 

She has generally said some pretty horrible and nasty things about my fiancé and his family, even though she has only met him for three hours at my college graduation and has never met his family. From conversation with a therapist I had before my fiancé and I started dating, she may have undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder and/or borderline personality disorder. She was angry at us for not coming to visit this summer (we live 4.5 hours apart and had activities planned most weekends) and when I suggested we do so in the fall since she brought it up and I wanted her to feel like I recognized what she was bringing up, she told me it was already too late (this is roughly 4 or 5 months after we starting dating)

She’s told me many times in rages to have a nice life and to go enjoy being with my new family. When we weren’t speaking a couple months back, she didn’t even call to tell me my childhood dog of 16 years died because “I didn’t ask how the dog was”. I never got a chance to say goodbye. Before this she had previously called me at 12:30 am after we hadn’t been talking for a little bit to ask me to loan her a couple thousand dollars because she had spent $10,000 at the casino. Later she told me she was looking at the wrong account and should’ve never asked.

All this to say my fiancé hates her with a passion and ultimately hates the way she treats me and talks about him and his family. This brings us to now where my fiancé has decided to postpone our wedding indefinitely, ultimately because of me and my mother until I can learn the ability to stand up for myself/our relationship as he calls it. 

When I told my mother the date, she said it was too soon and that she didn’t want to do a shabby job so she wouldn’t help me with the wedding. I asked if we moved it back a couple weeks if she would, and she said yes. I ended up asking my fiancé if we could move it to accommodate for more availability from vendors. While this was true, after more prying I told him that my mother had also suggested it and I wanted her to be a part of the wedding as well. My fiancé is mad that I broke our trust by not being forthcoming in the real reason why I suddenly wanted to move the date out of no where, for not standing up to my mom and letting her have her way over our wedding, and ultimately for letting her influence my thinking over our relationship. 

Ever since, we’ve been arguing pretty consistently. The entire thing has really got us just feeling sour and bitter about the whole wedding and engagement. He’s admitted he feels some resentment towards me because none of this was his doing, and his heart still wants to marry me more than anything because he realized the impossible situation I’m in. But he also needs me to prove that I am willing and able to stand up to my mom for our relationship and that I’m going to be loyal to him, not to my mom. The conversation of us calling the whole thing up has come up some, and he’s said if we went that route he would help me however he needed to in making sure my bills were paid and helping me move somewhere else if I wanted to, since it is a small town here. My in laws are absolutely incredible, and my MIL is like my best friend and has been such a great support through all this with my own mom. We often go out to lunch together, and just spend a lot of time together overall. Everyone is really rooting for us but knows things are hard. I just feel so sick and anxious over this whole thing. My mom is my only family, since my dad left when I was 14 and my mom isn’t close with any of her siblings, and all my grandparents are gone. I have no idea what to do and I really need advice and opinions above all else. How do I prove myself to my fiancé? How do I stick up to my mother, and how do I put our relationship first while still keeping a relationship with her? Can I salvage a relationship with both of them? My mom has made a lot of sacrifices for me, like being the parent that stayed when my dad left. But I also love my fiancé more than anything, and I hate the toll that this has taken on both of us. He’s said he’s just been in a down mood in general, he shutters anytime people tell him congratulations about our engagement, because he just feels like the whole thing is overshadowed by sadness. I’ve been pretty tore up about the wedding being put off and told him it’s hard for me to not cry when I put my ring most mornings.

1kfx7ma,Obligation to care for a parent,pxdelacr,"Me and my brother are in a conflict dispute with my older sister with the care of our father who is 79 years old and lives here in Ontario, Canada. My sister married an American and   lives in the U.S.   Our father is still physically ok with mobility and some self care but has been declining with dementia and has already failed a cognitive assessment test.  He cannot drive or cook anymore like he use to. He is not safe to live by himself.  He has a very good pension and large savings in the bank.

Me and my brother want him to live in an assisted living or a nursing home setting but my sister doesn’t agree because it would only deteriorate him . She wants him to live with me. My dad also expects me and my  brother to take care of him  because he said it’s the law.  He is also self entitled.  The problem is me and my wife work full time.  My brother also works.  Me and my wife won’t have the time and energy to take care of him full time.  He won’t get the proper care.  When dad is in my house he is  obnoxiously rude and stubborn. He expects us to do everything for him. He doesn’t respect the rules of the house.  He urinates in his room using a cup while the washroom is just beside his room.  Almost acts like a child.  The washroom is extremely dirty when he does use it. He doesn’t talk to me at all  like any normal  father would like how’s your day and I have to initiate  the conversation.  We cook and feed him 3 times a day and we don’t ask him for money.  I thought  an aging father would be wise and pass some wisdom but that isn’t the case with him, he’s miserable and gotten worse.  He doesn’t respect our boundaries.    It is emotionally and physically draining and we don’t  have the capacity to care for him.

I told my sister if she doesn’t want  him in a nursing home then she should take  care of him and live with her in the U.S because my dad also has a green card. My dad divorced his 2nd ex wife who was American.   My sister said that can’t happen because her lifestyle doesn’t fit my dad’s lifestyle. She quit her career to be a full time mom.  Instead, my sister wants him to live with me  and hire home care while me and my wife are away at work. My wife said absolutely no way. She said she will divorce me if it ever happens.  It would completely  change our life. So this is the issue we’re having right now  is what to do with dad’s living situation.

Here is a little background.  Me and my brother had an unpleasant experience growing up and suffered severe  emotional neglect  and physical abuse from our father when we were younger. Our narcissistic sister also treated us the same. I asked my father why he did this for closure.  My father denied it ever happened.  I had to show him the marks on my arms that it did happen and told him the different torture techniques he used on me and my brother.  My father also financially supported my sister all her life gifted her a car, renting her an apartment while she was in university and graduated.  My father would pay for her trips to travel abroad.  My sister never thought of repaying my father with any token of appreciation.  She told me a gift is not meant to be repaid.

It was the opposite for me and my brother.  My father never took us to travel or buy us anything to have fun.   I would be jealous of the other kids because they would be  enjoying playing video games, wearing nice shoes  and coming back from vacations during March break.  I started working part time when I was 17 to support myself.   My dad was strict with giving me money. We weren’t  allowed to even borrow the car to go to school which was a 2 hour bus ride each way. I eventually quit college because I couldn’t keep up and lost focus and had no guidance.  I started hanging out and coming home late so my dad kicked me out of the house.  That’s when I met my wife and took me in to live with her family and supported me while I  eventually went back to school years later to finish a degree and have a successful career.

I've already forgiven my dad  and I've accepted him for who he is, not expecting change, and letting him live his own way in peace, but at the same time I also need to honor myself and my own right to live in peace.

I suggested to have a family mediator service help and settle our differences with planning dad’s care.  My sister was hesitant at first to use one but finally agreed but she said we would use the one she knows from her area.

I'm mostly a SAHM mom though I'm working a bit more now as our kid gets a little older. I have always been clear that I want 2 kids, my partner is pretty clear that going through that first year again isn't something she can handle . I think part of it is her personality and part of it is related to our age gap- she just doesn't have a lot of stamina for sleep deprivation or really any of the challenges of having a young baby. She's way happier and more functional as a parent now that we're through the baby stage and have a walking talking kiddo.

We've talked a lot about having a second kid- She understands that it's not something I feel willing to compromise on and has agreed to a second baby if I basically handle all the sleep stuff and give her a lot of allowances around weekends away with friends, sleeping in, self care, etc. basically the offer is that she is willing to have a second kid as long as I do basically all the work for that first year. She works 40-50 hrs per week and does a ton around the house and the yard/garden so not a dead beat by any means but obviously this would still be a pretty unbalanced setup.

1kfuhjl,Am I Overreacting About Nasty Trash or Not?,MirroredMichael,"NSFW because this is really gross. It personally makes my stomach queasy. Hopefully I used the tag right. So lately my mom has had a really bad pilonidal cyst that’s been causing her a lot of pain and it makes me sick to my stomach when she talks about it. Earlier today, she was telling me about how much it drained today and I asked her, “Are you throwing the tissues (that she was cleaning herself up with) into the toilet and flushing them? I don’t want to have to see it,” because I subconsciously expected her to do something childish I guess, lol. She answered by saying something about putting them in a bag which I thought was weird but my brain normally assumed she’d take the bag out when she was done, right? Well, when I went to the bathroom a little later, my eye caught a glimpse of the “garbage bag” (walmart plastic bag) that had been sitting in the sink for a few days, and it clicked. I looked into it slightly without touching it and saw what was on the tissues. I almost died inside. I just finished showering before I started writing this and I felt queasy the whole time, putting together the fact that bag had been there for days, along with a smell i’d also noticed recently, what she had told me earlier, and what I saw. I could not brush my teeth because the bag is in the sink and there is no way I can touch it without vomiting. I have many many nasty stories about my family’s behavior and this is just one of them. I feel like I might be going crazy, lol. Also, for extra context, I am 16 so unfortunately I can’t move out yet. My parents have been preventing me from getting a job/drivers license as well so there’s no way for me to get out other than going to school.

1kfsnpd,"My mother in law is emotionally abusive, and the whole family enable her.",Informal-Fox-8115,"Bit of a long one! My husband and I have been together for nearly 8 years. His family have always struggled with their mental health, his mum and sisters are extremely anxious, co-dependent people, with no friendships, have worked from home for years, and are ultra-conservative. Both his sisters (around 40 years old) are not in relationships or have children. My husband (30) is the first one to get married. We have big friendship circles and busy lives, and they act quite resentful towards us because of this. Spending time together is a duty, rather than something actually enjoyable, and they all speak in guilt trips.

A couple of examples: My husband’s sister was going on a trip, and when his mum messaged “have a safe flight” in the group chat, he was having a super busy day at work and just love reacted to it. Later than night, his mum told him he was a super slack brother for not sending his own message, and kept repeating “how slack are you” to him. He was being spoken to like a child, and made to feel terrible about himself. Another example, we were visiting his nanna on Easter Sunday. His uncle wasn’t there, as he was travelling with his own family. When his nanna, who has dementia, ended up where he was, and we explained he was away so he’s visiting you tomorrow instead, my mother in law said to her “he doesn’t love you”. Mind you, this isn’t even her family, it’s her husband’s mum she’s saying this to. No one says anything, as they're not a family with open or honest communication. She says these comments, and no one's direct with her about how hurtful they are as she's so easily offended at everything.

Over the years, my husband has used disassociating as his coping mechanism, and just ignores or compartmentalises it. When I see it happen, it’s not something I can ignore as easily. I find it extremely abusive, and it’s impacting my mental health. Whenever we see them, I’m in fight or flight mode, and extremely anxious and stressed. My husband doesn’t want to have an honest conversation with his family, as he thinks it would mean a complete relationship breakdown with his parents, and he asks me to just not let it bother me. We’ve tried to implement strategies to protect ourselves, like for special events, we’ll suggest breakfast at his family so that we can do lunch at mine and allow ourselves to actually relax at my parents place, and not be sitting there stressing about the next one. This just ends up with them guilt tripping us harder, and is starting to really affect both of us. 

What can I do? I don’t want him to accept this treatment, for himself or for us. How can I make him see how harmful this is? He’s been conditioned to this his whole life, and to him, it’s normal, or a little snarky at best. I want to be a supportive wife, but not at the risk to my own mental health.

TLDR; My MIL is emotionally abusive/ manipulative and my husband disassociates. Now I’m the problem because I’m not just ignoring my husband being treated like  that. Should I just suck it up and learn to disassociate too? How can I be around them when it’s impacting my mental health?",2,2,1746494884.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfsnpd/my_mother_in_law_is_emotionally_abusive_and_the/

1kfs56c,I just I don’t understand…and it’s getting tiring,Top-Comfort-7117,"Hello, I basically want to vent. So I’m basically soon finishing with my bachelor degree and I am currently on campus. Right now my mom and dad is officially separating meaning he’s moving out, which it doesn’t really affect because he was never there for me emotionally, financially, etc. It was mostly my mom taking care of me.

For as long as I can remember, my mom has been always over the top. My uncle describes her as a helicopter parent. Just recently she went nuts. On I think Friday I had an assignment due at midnight and it was around maybe 11;20 ish and I was still finalizing the assignment. My mom calls me and I decline the call and text right away “I’m fine. I’m doing an assignment” she then calls multiple times but literally needed to submit an assignment on time. Mind you everytime she calls I mostly pick the phone if I’m not in class. After a while I finally finished the assignment and packing up to leave to library and I get a call from campus police saying can you please call your mother. I said okay since I’m done with the assignment and I call her. She goes nuts. She’s says always pick up the phone, I’m alone in the house, etc.
 
I literally told her you didn’t see my text I sent you? She doesn’t say anything about that and goes on a whole tangent. This isn’t the only time this happened by the way. Also, I always answer except when I’m in class or doing something. 

Now, the thing is when I call her, it’s very hard to reach her. There are times I would call her several times. Never pick up. But I never do this to her. It’s a little frustrating.

Also, the dynamic with my mom and as well with her mom (my grandma) is a lot. There were times I would come from campus so happy, feeling so good about myself. The minute my mom or grandmother sees me they tend nitpick my appearance. I remember just recently I went home and I had a blue dress on and I received several compliments from strangers outside. However when I came home my grandmother started teasing me in the dress saying “oh wow my granddaughter big. You will be a big girl”. The next day she calls my mom and the phone was on speaker and she says “she’s getting really fat in your hands. She shouldn’t be eating rice or too much breads”. But I kid you not, I don’t think I’m fat in the slightest. I’m curvy my hips are wide, I could say I’m slim thick. 
This also exacerbated when I started a guy and my mom would say, “why he approached you?” “Who else thinks you are cute on campus”. 

Also with my mom, she would also say negative dreams she about me and tell me. It’s giving me anxiety.


Idk with finals and with all of this it’s a lot. Idk how to work around this. Also I want to say my mom supports me financially fully, but after talking to a therapist I’m realizing this dynamic is causing my severe anxiety that I have. The relationship is bittersweet, she supports me  financially but the mental cost is a lot. Also it’s causing my negative self image.

1kfow5k,I hate my brother - some advice needed,Least_Ad3500,"I cannot stand my (F19) younger brother (M17).

For most of my life I have had to take care or assist in taking care of my brother due to our mothers (F46) mental illness and various crises she's experiences and our fathers (M52) general absence. We don't have any extended relatives to help take care of him so that responsibility fell onto me. To be clear, my brother, I'll call X for simplicity, has no known mental illnesses, disabilities, or other issues that would delay mental/emotional development. I have been diagnosed with GAD, OCD, and depression.

**My first issue with my brother is that he does nothing to help around the house.** For context: My father would often verbally abuse my mother if the house was not cleaned to his standard, all while doing nothing to assist. So this being the situation, it was expected that the kids, being me and X, would clean the house. However, for no known reason except X's own selfishness and presumed laziness, the chores would fall to me. If the house was not kept to a certain, and often unknown standard, I would be yelled at and often grounded while X was given no known punishment. I say ""no known"" because there may have been a punishment that I do not know of however, my punishments where often broadcasted to the rest of the household and that never happened with X. Following suit, as we've grown and being that my parents got a divorce in 2021 more of the responsibilities have fallen to me. My mother being in her ""free girl"" and ""spiritual"" ""era"" has decided that chores and household cleanliness is nothing to be worried about. Being that I have OCD, one of my compulsions includes cleaning the home until I feel it is safe enough. I am also in my third year of University, currently I am enrolled in a BA psych honours program that requires me to keep all my class averages above an 85%.

I have explained to both my mom and X (I don't bother with my dad because he's not in the picture right not) how I feel in many ways and how much I am struggling and nothing changes. Earlier today, the event that prompted me to write this, I was at work. Around 11:30 I messaged X to simply unload the dishes so there was one less task for me to complete, he responded with a skull emoji so I knew he has read the message meaning he had no excuse. Typically when I message him he won't respond so he can claim he ""didn't see the text."" At 11:50 I messaged him again, reminding him of what was asked. I got home at 12 and the fucking dishes were not unloaded. I asked him kindly again to unload the dished. He told me to ""fuck off"" This is not the first time this has happened. I can only estimate but issues like this happen at least three times a week and have been happening since 2022 when I started working and thus had less time to help around the house.

To be clear, this kid has school from 9-11, having a third period spare, meaning he has a 2 hour lunch. He is in grade 12 (or a senior, we are from Canada). When I was in grade 12, I had a similar schedule and used my time to clean or do homework. He sits of the couch and either a) sleeps or b) plays on his phone scrolling through tiktok or play clash of clans (? not sure if that's what its called). I have explained to both X and my mom how it pisses me off and from X I get called ""self-centred"" and from my mom I get a ""I will talk to him"" or a ""lay off of him."" In my opinion, nothing has changed.

I also want to mention that at the start of my grade 12 year my mom forced me to get a job at a grocery store, which hurt me because I have sensory processing issues (which she fucking knew about) and grocery stores are a huge trigger for me. This job was also 30 minutes away from my house. I am aware this is not the end of the world but given the myriad of undiagnosed mental health issues and perfectionism I dealt with at the time, it felt like the end of the world. So far X has looked for two jobs. One being at the end of his grade 11 year - this one was ""promised"" to him but fell through and is my moms words ""disappointed him and makes him not want to try again"" - and then again recently - dropping his resume off at a dollarama. It pisses me off so much that he has absolutely no expected roles in the family home to help while I had school, keeping my grades above a 95% average (I know it was only high school, however it still took quite a bit of time and energy), working around 25 hours a week, and keeping the house clean. He has no job, is failing 3 out of 4 of his classes (I want to say that I was taking the advanced position classes while he is only taking the entry level classes), and has no responsibilities around the house**My second issue is his choice of words.** He often uses slurs such as the r, n, f, I (the word historically used to describe indigenous peoples of Canada) and many more. He is a cis-het white male for any context. While these slurs do not directly harm me or any of my communities, it is still incredibly harmful. I am a leftist and hold myself to a high standard of education when it comes to education and my level of understanding towards the world. He is unfortunately falling down the alt-right pipeline and I have no idea how to fix it. He consistently refers to me and my mom as ""bitches,"" and to me as a ""fat fuck,"" or a ""slut/whore."" Again, words that make me fear for his future as our father was the same way and has recently ended up in jail due to his misogynistic views. I have talked to my mom about it and she brushed them off saying its teenage angst, where I know for a fact if I talked like that even now, let alone when I was 17, I would be screamed at.

**My third and hopefully final issue is him and his sleep.** Since I was in grade 4, I have been getting myself, X, and my mom up in time for school. My mom would drive us to school as it was to close for the bus but to far for us to walk. So in order to be out the door and not late I would wake myself up, feed the pets (Dogs and cats), let them out to play, make mine and X's lunch for the day, make myself breakfast (X and my mom refuse to eat breakfast), and by this time its usually 8am and I get them up. We are out the door by 8:25am. As a child if I was late even a minute I would be in hysterics and have to go home for the day. Thankfully, as a teen and adult I now have better coping skills to adjust myself correctly for it I am late to something (I still hate being late, let the record be known). However, I have not been in Gen-Ed for nearly 3 years now, and still have to wake X up. My mom thankfully has gotten better, however, she leaves 10 min before me for work leaving me to deal with X. I have tried fucking everything from gently waking him up as though he is a baby, turn the overhead lights on and off in quick succession, beginning the process of waking him up at 7:30 to give him an extra half hour, pulling the blankets off him, spraying him with water (which I have since stopped at the request of my therapist), yelling, and using a very loud alarm. Nothing works. He never wakes up. I do not know what time he goes to bed as I am asleep by 8pm to wake up at 5am to go to the gym at 5:30am. I am so fucking tired I don't even know what to do.

I don't know what im doing anymore and I just want him to stop. I don't know how much I can take of this anymore. I just want to be a kid, and yeah I know im 19 but fuck me man I can't keep doing this.",1,1,1746484030.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfow5k/i_hate_my_brother_some_advice_needed/

1kfkfjm,I’m going to be starting family therapy with my dad soon and I’m nervous,FelixBlix0,"(not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, please let me know if anywhere else is more appropriate!)

I’ve had a crappy relationship with my dad ever since I was young due a handful of moments where he got very upset with me over seemingly small mistakes/gaps in knowledge, along with one or two nightmares involving him SAing me. Ever since I was about twelve or thirteen I’d refuse to spend one on one time with him (I’m now eighteen) but recently he’s really been pushing me to spend time with him. We went out for lunch on Saturday and I grew incredibly anxious, I felt miserable. When we got home I asked my mom if I had to spend one on one time with him, and she basically said I had to since he’s paying for my medications, college tuition/housing etc. I responded by saying that I wouldn’t go to college anymore in that case and she stormed away.

Today we talked again because my dad’s at work so she wasn’t worried about him hearing us. She told me that my choices are either to be more cordial towards him around the house and
when we’re out or go to family therapy with him. I landed on the latter, because although I’ve heard pretty negative things about getting family therapy with a parent you have a bad relationship with I figured there would at least be a third party involved.

I’m really not sure what to expect, he’s been receptive to the idea that he’s traumatized me in the past but I’m still anxious. I’m not even sure what we’re going to talk about honestly. 

I guess the reason I’m making this post is to see if anyone has any advice about our appointments with a therapist, or if I should know anything else beforehand. Thank you!

1kfkc7u,"Comparing the ""Emin Pasha rescue mission"" to my relation with my narcissist parents",Just-Bluejay-700,"
 
Let me use the famous “Emin Pasha rescue mission” as a comparison to how narcissistic parents act toward their children.
 
I feel like Emin Pasha, back in 1890 . I am happily living in Africa. I have plenty of supplies, the troops are doing good, the food is good, the people are great. Everything is all right.
I have not written or made contact to the outside world for 3 years, and why should I ? I am surrounded by immense forests, wild rivers, in this paradise.
Except, in the UK they don’t think I am doing all right. Nor in NewYork. In NewYork they think that Africa is a place of misery and disaster. Even more so in the diabolic “dark heart of Africa” ,where I happen to be!  It is a place they imagine to be full of insects, disease, evil people, tribal violence, worm infested food, and chopped heads on spikes.
So the NewYork high society, in corporation with the NewYorkTimes newspaper,  sets out to “rescue” me,  Emin Pasha. A noble goal to save a soul from the African hell. They dial up the well-known adventurer Morgan Stanley. Famous for chopping his way through unchartered African jungle. He will have to lead an expedition to get to me , and save me from my miserable condition.
 
Except I am doing just great, in fact I fell in love with an absolutely beautiful African lady, she has such strong and warm character, I never been more in love. I love the food too, I needed to get used to these exotic tastes. But the casava , igname and grilled fish are amazing! The nature here is stunning too, high mountain tops to 5400 meters, snowcapped. Landscapes and valleys dotted with cactus like plants, and big massive afrormosia trees, smelling like roses on steroids. Not to mention the animals here , gorillas, giraffe, elephants, … what a paradise!
 
While I am strolling through the wonderful African landscapes, Back in New York, they are preparing my “rescue”. Stanley hires 40 men, willing to join him on this epic , heroic mission to save me , Emin Pasha. It makes headlines in the NewYork times. It was normal for a newspaper to sponsor and drum up attention for such expedition, since it was going to be so much fun reading about it. Indulging in the African misery show.
Stanley and his crew steam up the Congo river, to the city of Leopoldville, nowadays Lubumbashi. There they unload the -state-of-the-art equipment. Most importantly a special  made-for-the-occasion steel boat. The boat named “Advance”. It can be taken apart into sections. Each section can be carried by 2 men, in rough terrain. The idea is to chop with machetes trough the dense jungle, and whenever possible use waterways , if they come across one. After all , this is uncharted, virgin rainforest! They have no idea where, in what direction the rivers run, or even if there are any rivers at all. No idea how high the waterfalls are nor how many rapids the presumed rivers have. The distance from Lubumbashi to the region where I - Emin Pasha- am, is about 300 miles. 300 miles of the roughest, most untamed rainforest on earth.
So they start making their way through the rainforest, an ever denser jungle. Uphill, downhill, mud, swamps….a damp , insect infested jungle. Poisonous snakebites, mosquitoes. Muddy water to drink , teaming with bacteria. They only go a few miles a day, many get sick, the supply is dwindling. The forest has no food to offer for he who doesn’t know what is edible. A first team member dies , tired and weakened by unknown disease. Then a second, a third, …. Until half the crew died. 20 men dead.
Finaly they make it trough the rainforest, weakened, ill, hungry, soaking wet, they stumble on, They look for me. But can’t find me. Until they come across a local, and surprisingly, one that I have taught English. With help from the local, they find my village,  in search of me,
Only to find me, Imen Pasha, happily in my hammock, after a delicious dinner, having a nap.
I am happy to see them, at first, but surprised how ill and exhausted they look, stunned to find out that half of them died in the jungle,  I feel pity, sadness for them,  and give them all they need , food, clothes, a place to stay. And 3 bottles of Champagne.
 
Stanley and his crew happily accept, they eat, and fall asleep shortly after. The following days they do nothing but eat and sleep, just to get back to a normal weight, and lifted spirit, gaining a bit of strength. They now wash, shave, chat, eat, and sometimes even laugh.
 
And already on day 3, Stanley asks me to “ have a serious talk”,
With the only real subject, being that I need to immediately “come back” to New York.
I ask why? Why would I leave this place? This place is so beautiful, nice.
But they keep insisting, day after day, that they need to “rescue” me….",1,1,1746472862.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfkc7u/comparing_the_emin_pasha_rescue_mission_to_my/
1kfkb3u,cutting ties with family?,PositiveLog5677,"hi, this is so out of my comfort zone to do this, but i really need help. Me and my boyfriend have been dating in secret for about a year and a half now, his family knows about me and i’ve met all of his family members and extended family, they’re italian american christians, he is not religious though. My family is all muslim, which is why I keep him a secret, I do not believe in islam or want to practice any religion either.

The issue is we are going to start college this fall, and we’re going to the same one (not because we’re dating, it just happened to be this way). it’s like a 3 hour drive away from my hometown. But the issue is, he’s asking me if i’m ever going to tell my family about him, and the thing is, i don’t know

I want to cut my family off, not because of him, but because of all the distress they’ve caused me, my whole life my grandmother has abused me mentally and has always made comments about me, she almost didn’t let me go to college because she thinks i’d start going crazy and getting with guys, which i’m not planning on doing bruh, i just want to get an education so i don’t have to rely on other people.

My mother is so bipolar, she can be so evil at times but then she has her moments where she’s supportive and is kind, which is why i just can’t stand the thought of leaving her. she’s suffered through so much with my grandma parading her life, even as an older woman now.

I love my mom dearly and it’s probably the hardest part of me cutting them off, which is why i need help. every turkish girl i’ve met has only had the same goals, to be a nurse and to marry and have kids, that’s it. which it’s okay to want that, but i do not, but it’s expected of me.

i’m going into a stem field which is already frowned upon, my mother supports me completely for that, but also does not want me to date or anything either she is very religious and would probably want to do an arranged marriage for me sometime after college, i do not want this. she wants to keep our family image up because if you don’t know already, turkish people insist on marrying other turkish people, they do not date, they just get married immediately to others of the same culture, my mother wants this for me too because she never got that, she married outside the culture and religion which was incrediblely frowned upon and she is still being harrassed for it to this day, they’re also miserable they do not love eachother anymore.

I want to be able to live my own life, happily with my boyfriend and his lovely family, if he ends up being in the picture, he isn’t dictating any of my choices to cut my family off, but if i want to have him in my life I need to make a decision, so he doesn’t waste his time and i don’t waste my time fighting for us.

I just want to know if there are any other people in my current situation, i am 18, a girl and i just want to know the upsides and the downs of cutting family off like this, specifically for my situation. i’m sure there are people out there who have been in the same boat as me, and i just need some advice on what decisions i should make. please help.

1kfkam4,When does the stealing stop?,Mountain_Culture8536,"Just venting but also has anyone dealt with a sibling that steals things from you? 
I have a sister who's 7 years younger than me and I didn't care about her borrowing things until she would take my clothes and ruin them. Not out of spite (at least I don't think so) but she just doesn't know how to take care of things if they aren't hers. She would take my clothes and give it back with stains on them (food, paint, grease, whatever). I know it's just clothes but they were expensive items I had bought at the time on my very small paychecks. 
Now, she steals my makeup or hair products that are on the expensive side. She's 22. She has a full time job that pays her real well. More than what I made when I was working. 
I'm a SAHM and whenever she comes to visit my baby, something goes missing. I confront her and she'll say she never took anything from me or that she doesn't know what I'm talking about but there's only a handful of things I buy and use daily that I notice when they're gone. The thing that upsets me is that I don't have income, so I save the little money I get to splurge on good hair and makeup products. 
I notice she does something similar with my mom. She'll ask to borrow like $10 to buy snacks or food but she'll take a $20 or whatever money my mom has in her purse and pocket the change or the rest of the money. 
I've already confronted her but she's very firm on her ""I didn't take anything"" statement and I don't know what to do. 
I'll empty out everything to look for what's missing and never end up finding it. It's driving me crazy

1kfjanb,Mom keeps losing my money,Top-Standard-6755,"To keep a long story short, I went to basic training and AIT and my money was deposited into a shared account between my mother and I. I joined when I was a minor and I wasn’t allowed to have my own account at the bank until I was 18 and if you know anything about the army, they do not like to change shit. 
Well, she ended up taking a lot of money and promised she was going to pay me back the full amount when I came back. News flash, she did not. So we agreed for her to make payments. Newsflash, she stopped after 6 months. Nowhere near the amount she that she should’ve paid back. Overtime, I just dropped the issue and counted that money as a loss because it doesn’t matter if I fight it or not, I’m not ever seeing that money again. 

Fast forward 2 years later, I needed her to book a venue for my wedding. I sent her the money and she paid the venue. Well, some stuff happened and my husband and I couldn’t do the wedding anymore because of a family issue on his side. We cancelled the wedding and since we cancelled it super early, we able to get the majority of our money back (minus $60). The venue told my mother they would have money refunded in 5-7 business days. 

On the 4th business day my mother told me “well if I don’t get it tomorrow, then I’m calling😡” 

I said” wait until the 7th business day” she tends to be super intense about everything and I was just trying to prevent a meltdown.

At the end of the second week I had called her and asked her about the refund and she said “oh well I’m sure it’ll be soon 😇”
And that’s when I became suspicious because she was super intense about it in the beginning of the week and now she doesn’t care? 
I tell my husband that I don’t think we’re getting the money back because she’s gonna end up using and lying to us about why. 

Well what do you know?? She called me on the 4th week (after the refund) and said she owed the bank and the bank ended up taking it. And it just so happened to be the exact amount that was refunded and that she’ll make payments to me… 

I truly wasn’t surprised, but it still peeved me because wtf 

And for those who are gonna say “well you should’ve learned your lesson the first time” that is a fair point, however: 

1. The venue is a lot cheaper if you are a resident of the city that it’s in. She’s the only family member who is a resident of that city. Therefore we had her do it.
2. I was also under the impression that she was financially doing better. 

No I’m not planning on suing or getting legal stuff involved. 
I’m just no longer paying or loaning anything else because she doesn’t understand how to have self control with money.

Mom takes refunded venue money from cancelled wedding and lies about it.

1kfiz4c,"Help Your Mother Write Her Story
Write Your Life Story for Posterity -- Your Gift to Her",maureen1231,"Sunday is Mother’s Day.

For those lucky enough to still be able to celebrate with their mothers, consider bestowing an eternal gift: help her write her life story for posterity.

I just read a great article on the difference between people who actively try to direct events in their own lives versus people who are more passive.

When it comes to asking parents to answer questions and write their life stories, this situation often occurs. Some take action to get answers to questions while their parents are still able. Others inadvertently let the clock run out and then experience overwhelming regret.

Relationships between parents and children can be complex. Some women, for example, are reluctant to consider writing their life stories because they believe their families are not interested and that they have nothing out of the ordinary to say.

But surveys repeatedly show that families want more information about the lives of their parents and grandparents. In one survey, adult kids said they want to know more about the early lives of their parents, while moms said they would be glad to share their experiences but they thought their kids were not interested because they never asked.

On the eve of Mother’s Day, you can change the dynamic by showing your mom that you actually want her to write her story. Since it is clearly important that she feel her loved ones actually want a written life story, tell her you do.

Show her the Decade-by-Decade Method, a simple way in which she answers questions pertaining to each decade of her life. Print out the post for the [first decade](https://maureensantini.substack.com/p/chapter-1-your-first-decade) so that she has a clear idea of what is involved.

In addition, pledge your willingness to meet regularly, such as weekly, to read the questions for each decade as she writes her answers. This process will naturally allow you to get answers to all of your questions, even the ones you didn’t know you had.

Select a mutually agreeable day and time to start as a way of showing your commitment to get together until the draft is complete.

At the end of the process, have copies bound for each family member. Make sure she knows her family will cherish the book forever.

Helping your mom write her life story for posterity is the best Mother’s Day gift ever.",1,1,1746469616.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfiz4c/help_your_mother_write_her_story_write_your_life/
1kffhxe,What is my dad doing with his money !?!?,,"I (F19) just really got the grasp of how much of a loser my dad (59) is.

It first started when I was in the 4th grade, he moved to the US so I could “have a better life”, I was born and raised in Spain (I’m mixed with Ecuadorian from mom and Cuban from dad) but I moved to the US when I started 7th grade.

He missed a lot of my crucial moments/ages because he was working the whole time yet he doesn’t have any money or own anything to his name. He always gave me this stupid excuse of how he’s been working hard this whole time so I can have a better life; yet I don’t see any of the money or efforts that he so desperately worked for (IDK WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS MONEY BRUH). Since I’m the youngest out of my 4 siblings (all of them are adults) I was the only one that moved here to the US along with my mom (57). It put a lot of pressure on me over the years since I’m the only one that knows Spanish/English fluently, I was 12 y/o already translating important documents that a kid shouldn’t even be doing. I always had to translate/help for my parents for ANYTHING and there was not a single moment where I actually enjoyed or had the time to enjoy regular teenage girl things because of them and because of that I developed a lot of stress early in my life. I don’t really blame my mom for anything because she was the one who basically raised me by herself and she didn’t want this life or misery, my dad is really hard on her. My problem really is with my dad, he’s a man child that doesn’t know how to control his emotions, talking to him feels so pointless; I’ve expressed how I feel about him multiple times but it feels like I’m talking to a wall. He always used to put out his anger on me like I was his emotional toy to use, this changed overtime as I grew older because I didn’t wanna put up with it anymore but now he’s doing the same thing to my mom. He always talks about the same things, how his arms/body hurt and how he’s miserable because he’s working on a different state and his not with us (mind you he works out of state so he only comes home max twice every month for like a week), how he barely has any money/he owes money to people yet he chooses to have that life. He’s always talking about the same damn things and it’s never anything different, he always gets mad when I tell him I don’t want to hear any of his miserable bullshit because it doesn’t make me feel good at all. I’ve grown to be very anxious because of him, I always feel like I have to walk on eggshells because as soon as something doesn’t go his way he starts exploding and he has to make his problems everybody’s problems. Lately he’s been demanding that I start paying rent because the financial situation is tight. My cousin from his side recently moved to my house with her husband and son because they immigrated from Cuba to the US and they didn’t have anyone to receive them. First of all he didn’t even consult me or my mom to see if we were fine with them moving to our house, he just brought them home without saying anything (I don’t have anything against them but it’s still very annoying). Second of all, because of them we have been spending more money on the bills and food so now he’s demanding that I help pay rent along with my cousin and her husband. I wouldn’t mind helping if it wasn’t for the fact that he gets payed weekly twice more than me but somehow he never has any fucking money, I’ve been planning on moving out soon with my boyfriend (20) because I can’t stand this situation anymore but it’s very hard for me to move out considering that I have to give him $400 out of my check. I still have leftover money but there’s stuff that I also pay on my own so I basically don’t really have a lot of money left. He always talks about himself and how miserable he is. I hate having to even call him because he’s always talking about the same shit and as soon as I talk about something regarding myself, he somehow manages to switch it up on “poor him” ALWAYS. I’m just very frustrated and angry at this point because he’s embarrassed me and done/said a lot of horrible things to me but he acts like he never did. I love my dad very much but I’m really starting to resent him as the days go on. Every time he comes home the vibe always changes (everyone notices his horrible energy so everyone has to walk on eggshells every time he’s home). I hate when he gets home because he’s always complaining about how hard his life is but he never wants to do anything about it, he loves complaining to everyone and I’m FED UP.

I really would appreciate any advice or help because I’m at the point where I just wanna go in a corner and cry. I feel like I can never have a good relationship with him because he’s never really been involved with my life and now it’s too late, I feel very awkward and tense around him. I don’t even feel like I’m his daughter, I feel like I’m some type of secretary or helper because he’s always relying on me for almost everything, like he is hopeless if I don’t help him. He has done a lot more horrible things but this is a basic summary of everything. He is hopeless and I’m not going to be here for any longer to tolerate his misery. My problem now is that I don’t know how to control/cope with this anxiousness/stress and also on how to control the way I feel because as soon as my dad does/say something it’s like my whole mood changes and I feel shitty. I know that the cause is my dad; but it feels so hard to control it and I haven’t really had any luck with it. I’ve been coping with smoking 🍃 but it’s been about 3 yrs or so and I’m tired of this cycle, I feel very lost.",0,19,1746461410.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kffhxe/what_is_my_dad_doing_with_his_money/

1kfd30o,My son just married a narcissist,Healingisforever,"My son (24) just married a young woman I believe is a narcissist (20). They dated for 2 months before she said she would be homeless if he didn’t let her move in. She was living with an older sister & had never lived on her own. 
He is a firefighter who owned his home. A few months after they got engaged and set a wedding date for 6 months later. We started seeing troubling signs early on but we were also trying to be supportive. For example, I was battling breast cancer when they met and our son & I have always been close. Even though he lives a state away, we talked often & he would always text or call on treatment days. I had a big surgery scheduled and it was important to our family that he be there. He agreed and scheduled time off to make the 6 hour drive and stay a few days with his dad & sister while I was in the hospital. A couple days before he tells us that his girlfriend’s dad’s truck broke down and he had to go tow the truck for him. My husband explained that it would cost him more money to drive 200 miles away, tow it for the dad and drive back home than it would for the dad to have the truck towed by a company. Our son explained that his girlfriend told him she would have to send her folks money if he didn’t help. 
So he missed the surgery to help a brand new girlfriend’s dad tow a vehicle. I never said anything but it hurt my feelings. 
Other lies started being told and we were beginning to worry. Like there were no pictures of her before the age of 4 & that she hadn’t pooped in 5 months….ridiculous things. (We eventually asked her folks about these things and they confirmed our concerns that these things were not true but that it wasn’t a big deal that she lies so much.)
They began fighting constantly and he asked us to help him tell her he wanted to wait to get married until they completed marriage counseling. Evidently, she wouldn’t listen to him. He thought our 28 year marriage advice might be something she would respect. We had them for Christmas and tried to explain that rushing into marriage wasn’t a great idea & counseling would be a wise decision. She flipped out & demanded they leave. 
Before they left, we watched our son break down into sobbing meltdowns. He was begging her to stop fighting him on everything. She was ice cold and showed zero empathy for his tears and pleas. It was then we saw how mentally abusive she was. The next day she blocked our entire family, including out son’s sister, on social media. 
Our son called us and explained that we owed her an apology. What? Come again?
We went back & forth over the next few months trying to show him the red flags. We tried a counseling appointment (which was a huge waste of time & money), we tried letters…nothing worked. He actually stopped talking to all of us. He is convinced we are wrong & she is right and we’re the bad guys. 
Meanwhile, nobody received wedding invitations. Not grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, etc…
I finally called to ask if the wedding was still on and was told by him they were eloping. 
And they did. Though the elopement included her mom, sisters & a few friends. It looked like our son had two of his friends in attendance. 
So that’s that. They married anyway. 
I’m hoping they divorce sooner rather than later. She is an abusive person with a very toxic family. She is totally ok with isolating him from everyone in his life that loves him. He has spoken to nobody in his family since Christmas (besides the couple times we tried to explain the nightmare he was in). 
She is 20. It seems she was looking for an escape from her own life & saw a kind young man with a good life who would rescue her. I’m so concerned they will have kids. She would just use them to punish all involved and only hurt the kids in the process. This is a living nightmare. Every morning I wake up & pray for my son and remind God it would be a good day to deliver him from her and her family. But I even pray for her. This has broken all of our hearts. 
Please tell me there is hope. I’ve never been one to celebrate divorce but in this case, I hope the statistics are right. ",22,18,1746455541.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfd30o/my_son_just_married_a_narcissist/
1kfalb9,Boyfriend wants me to perpetually help his family and now accuses me of giving his daughter poor advice,GooseSoggy7518,"I'm (34F) in a situation where my relationship ( M38) has deteriorated partially because he thinks I don't help his family the way that I help mine. My family has had very challenging situations, many having to do with business situations. They are very hard working and not coming from the upper class, we have maintained our grassroots values. 

His family has problems. They are still reeling from MIL and FIL breaking up, but that was over 16 years ago. They can't accept that their father moved on, can't stand their cousins who have become very successful, and can't hold down a job. MIL was a SAHM, didn't get a job even when her kids were suffering because FIL refused to pay child support or help more or something along those lines. She lives off government assistance and is very difficult to get along with because she tends to other her children's partners. They are nice to my kids, though. I just avoid having them around because I protect my kids from their drastic behaviors.

Right now, I can't even share that my family are happily living together becase he will ask me how much I invested for that to happen and I know myself and will likely tell him off because I know it would be a sarcastic question. I was helpful to his family for a long time, but I got tired because they never fully warmed up to me and because they kept needing things from me. 

I would like for him to understand that partners shouldn't be expected to be a foot stool, and that he will continue to fail in life because of this, but also, I know that he won't listen.

I have a decent relationship with his daughter, but he has taught her to be helpless and lazy. She's an awesome kid, and my only legacy for her would be to teach her some self-reliance. 

She and I had a long talk ( friendly, not a lecture) because she literally has no college prospects. She got rejected from every University that she applied for, and she refuses a community college.  I adviced trade school, or go to a local college next year, build her grades, and get to a Uni. She liked the idea, but he accused me of diverting her goals. That if she wants to go to Uni, she should wait. He doesn't have money for her tuition. Her mother can pay for it but she doesn't have a chance for entrance. Now I feel like ai should have stayed quiet. 

I keep thinking of things I should have said other than what I did. 

Edit: He has never done anything for my family, and I've respected that because I didn't want to overwhelm him.",23,33,1746448746.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kfalb9/boyfriend_wants_me_to_perpetually_help_his_family/

1kf4w8w,Aunt Throwing out deceased grandfathers belongings before probate process has occured.,BloodshotRoseYT,"Hello Reddit, I'm reaching out to see if anyone knows what to do with my situation. I live in Ohio and recently my grandfather has passed away, which has hit me and my immediate family very hard. We are unsure if he had a will, so right now we are planning for the probate court process to go 50/50 between my mother and aunt, the issue is that my aunt lives in Michigan, hasn't had contact with him more than once in over 20 years, and has now officially ransacked his property. She had forced us to remove his animals from the house and threatened to call the dog warden on us, whilst also threatening to change the locks.

Now the biggest issue is that she had broken into the backyard, broken in through the backdoor, and has removed items from the house including documents, jewelry, and pet supplies. On top of this, we found two trashcans filled with clothing and other items from the house placed at the curb this morning. From what we have seen this can cause legal issues especially because an attorney said that she would not be the executor of the estate due to my grandfather and mother both being Ohio Residents whilst my aunt is not.

We are unsure how to navigate this, especially depending on variables like my grandfathers missing items, breaking and entering, and whether he does have a will. If there's any tips or details someone could help me with here, it would be much appreciated.

TL;DR, Aunt shows up, robs and trashes grandfathers house 2-3 days after his passing.",1,1,1746426474.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kf4w8w/aunt_throwing_out_deceased_grandfathers/

I have half brothers and sisters on both my dad and mom’s side. My issue is with my mom’s side which is who I live with while being home from college. My household contains my step dad, my mom, my younger sister who is in 3rd grade and my younger brother. Ever since my mom has started this new family I can’t help but feeling more and more excluded and left out. As well being treated differently than the other two kids. To keep the story short my other siblings within the home are aloud to get away with just about anything. Examples cussing my mom and my step dad out calling them everything under the sun even slurs without being checked or punished. As well as being able to slam doors, make highly inappropriate noises, making inappropriate jokes or talking about sex, and so much more. Like so bad that my younger sister who I don’t even think was in kindergarten yet, split my grandmas head open with a miniature shovel for gardening and when my grandma was crying and stuff my mom and sister were laughing and making fun of her. They also let the kids disrespect whoever they want as well including elders. Now where I come in is that I wouldn’t be allowed to get away or do any of this even if I tried. When I even bring up some that concerns me my mom flips out and starts screaming and literally goes crazy. It’s even gotten so bad that my step dad has put his hands on my twice and one time leaving bruises due to me being upset because they let their new dog chew up some that I specifically told them to watch out for. But when I got mad my mom got up into my face and so did my step dad with his finger which lead to me pushing it away which in turn lead to the me getting bruises. I also have no sort of privacy because ever since my younger sister has well be able to walk ig she purposefully bugs and does stuff to get on my nerves or to be weird. She’s watched me sleep several times, has peeped and opened the door to the bathroom when I was using the bathroom or getting into the shower(fyi the bathroom door to our house has never had a lock on it), peaked under my door when I’ve had significant others over and so much more. The most recent time being today just an hour ago when I went to use the bathroom I took a second to piss due to being a nervous when peeing and I immediately hear through the next room my sister giving my mom a run down of what I looked like using the bathroom and etc. with my mom asking details and further intriguing the conversation. When I was only in the bathroom for less than 2 mins at that point. This happens very often and idk what to do at the point because I do not even feel comfortable or safe doing anything in this house without feeling watched or checked up on because both my siblings and parents constantly ask me what I’m doing or what I’m eating. And if I’m eating I’m called a fat ass or etc. other aspects to this is that I have Asperger’s syndrome and have been diagnosed with depression, serve anxiety, as well as ibs which can make using the bathroom very difficult. Can I have some advice on what to do in this situation? (P.s. sorry if I’m all over the place my blood is boiling and I just feel very embarrassed and ashamed. I can provide more details if needed)  (also double p.s. but I’m 20 years old and I still have not gotten my license or have had a job, not for a lack of trying but every time I do some happens or comes up that my mom talks me out of doing it or makes it to where I can’t do it or attend)",7,17,1746408719.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kezybn/first_time_posting_in_here_but_i_need_some/

We foster and also have a family friend staying with us for a while which puts us at 7 girls ages 2-18 and my wife and I in our 40s. Needless to say this comes with a very wide range of personalities and interests. Sometimes the teenagers only want to watch movies with a specific actor in it. Sometimes as parents we want to watch something “classic” but can’t think exactly what so we’d like to set a year range of say 1985-1999, or lets say specifically Disney movies for a given year range. Then you have the completely unpredictable and absolutely random movie interest of the 5-10 year old kids.

It’s also tricky to get started at an exact time with busyness of a 9 person home. This leads to start times not always being as consistent as we’d like and we often have to shift at the last minute to find a movie that will work in the time window given. This one is actually the biggest thing we run into. Is there a site where I can filter movies by 1hr, 1.5hrs, 2hrs, 2.5hrs, etc?

1ket4yd,How would you like to preserve your family's life stories?,Straight_Quiet_5128,"**What if your grandchildren could one day hear your grandmother’s voice telling her life story?**

Hi everyone,  
I'm currently working on a passion project called **Dear Legacy**. The goal is to help families preserve the life stories of their loved ones in a truly special way – not just as written text or photo albums, but as living, breathing **audio memories**.

Imagine your children or grandchildren one day listening to their great-grandparents talk about their childhood, the love of their life, their choices, mistakes, and milestones.  
It’s not just about remembering – it’s about **feeling someone again.**

I’m developing a concept that makes this possible: simple, respectful, and deeply emotional.

To understand how helpful such a service could be, I’ve created a short survey (just 3–4 minutes).  
If you have a family of your own – or simply wish more stories were passed down for future generations – **I’d be so grateful if you took a moment to share your thoughts.**

**Take the survey** [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5A2B-kISO7qzVECRJwbErVO5kWIIU8qmkRrYzGGdzrJ4MZg/viewform?usp=header](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5A2B-kISO7qzVECRJwbErVO5kWIIU8qmkRrYzGGdzrJ4MZg/viewform?usp=header)

1kesoyu,"Anyone ever heard the phrase ""walking on eggshells?"" This is my family to a T.",,"# 

Except my mother. But my 3 siblings and father all overreact to the most innocuous things. I am 46 and have gone through some major challenges in the last 10 years (divorce, broken engagement, financial strain, etc). I am at a point where I simply have no more room in my life for conflict.

Just hung up on my sister who I literally just told I that I was not going to tolerate the cursed family temper any longer. That if anyone were to fly off the handle at me I was going to be exiting the situation. The topic for discussion was regarding my younger brother who is suspected of taking advantage of my mom for a loan. She claimed he is not paying her back at the rate he said he would and I asked her how she knew and for some reason this set her off. Her reaction made no sense and was completely out of proportion to the matter at hand. This is pretty common for her. 

It's like a can see her scowl and feel the tension through the phone. If you knew her you would know what I mean. It's so irrational, so unnecessary and so destructive.

I pointed out that she did not need to get angry and it made her even more heated and then starts to accuse me of using an aggressive tone when I literally just said ""wait, so he \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?"" and inquired how she knew of these alleged actions.

I simply cannot deal with these people anymore. It is so ridiculous how my siblings and father get so angry at the most benign things.

I am at the point where I am ready to cut all of them out, with the exception of my elderly parents who are nearing the end and have health issues.

1kepfmo,Griefs and my dad cheating on my mother.,Ordinary_Boats,"Hello, I hope you're doing well. Here’s the situation: I’m 25 F. I’m writing to you because I’ve been through a lot in the past few months and I need to talk about it.

On January 21st, my maternal grandfather passed away from cardiac arrest at 68 years old. It was my first time experiencing grief, and I took it very badly. Then, on March 20th, my maternal grandmother passed away as well, from a stroke, at 70 years old. It was another huge shock.

Then, on April 19th, a week after my birthday, my paternal grandmother passed away. Her death was more “expected” because she had been suffering from Alzheimer’s for over ten years and had been in a nursing home for eight years. She hadn’t recognized us for a long time, but she was the grandmother I was closest to, and losing her really shook me.

What made it even harder was that we had to wait ten days before the funeral because of the crematorium and church availability. Those ten days felt so long and painful.

On top of all that, there were big problems with my father’s family. They criticized my sister and me, insulted us for no valid reason. For example, they reject my sister because she’s a lawyer, saying that lawyers defend criminals and that it’s not a respectable profession. As for me, I’m studying to become a legal assistant, and that’s not acceptable to them either because I’m still “in the law.” From what I’ve heard, it’s actually my cousin who’s causing problems.

It’s extremely hard to deal with grief while also having family members who don’t respect you. For example, we had all chosen songs for my grandmother’s funeral, but the two songs my sister and I had picked were removed from the ceremony.

On top of all this, my parents argue all the time. They haven’t loved each other for a long time and should have divorced already. My father blames my mother for not being there for him during his grief, but he himself wasn’t there for my mother’s losses earlier this year and in March. They constantly criticize and fight, unable to support each other.

During those ten days, my father’s family, who had come from Lyon and were causing problems, stayed the whole time. My father insisted we see them because, for him, “that side of the family” came before the four of us: my sister, my mother, him, and me. It was such a tough ordeal, and everyone suffered.

But today, I also found out something else. I looked at my father’s phone because I had a bad feeling, and I discovered that he’s cheating on my mother. This isn’t the first time: when I was 15, he was already contacting escorts. I told my mother back then. He swore they were just messages, that he never went any further, but I didn’t believe him because I had already caught him before without saying anything. When I exposed him, it caused huge fights, and my mother never trusted him again.

He still holds it against me today for telling the truth, blaming me for looking at his phone and for talking about it, as if it were my fault.

Recently, while we were staying at our vacation home to try and recover from everything, I saw messages where he invited someone to come over, with winking emojis and very suggestive messages. He had renamed the contact “St Yriex” which is the city she lives in and deleted their conversations.

My sister also found out things: when she went to pick up a package at Sephora, they gave her a parcel my father had ordered—a perfume that wasn’t for my mother, or for me, or for my sister. He took the package, but we’ve never seen that perfume at home, and my sister is convinced he gave it to someone else.

She also told me that when I was younger, she had once caught him sending heart emojis to another woman and had confronted him about it. This behavior has been going on for a long time.

My sister says she doesn’t know what to do. On one hand, if I tell, she thinks my mother will stay anyway, that nothing will change, and that I’ll just get yelled at again. She says it’s their responsibility, not ours. But on the other hand, I’m struggling with the fact that my mother keeps calling him affectionate names, pretending in front of others, while at home they’re always fighting and saying they hate each other.

I still live with them while I finish my studies because I can’t afford to move out, so it’s really hard to distance myself from all this.

My mother doesn’t know anything. It’s also important to know that my mother is visually impaired, so she can’t see, she can’t know who my father is talking to. I feel like my father is kind of taking advantage of her disability.

So, should I add this “revelation” to everything we’re already going through, with all the grief? Are we ready for that? I really don’t know. I just needed an outside opinion, from someone who doesn’t know my father, my mother, my sister, or me.

It’s really weighing on me to act like nothing’s happening.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Wishing you a very good day or evening.

We grew up together in severe poverty, but we all were pretty close growing up. My (19F) sister has become a serious problem for my family. For the past few years, she has been what can only be described as a true demon spawn. Cussing everyone out, constant disrespect to literally all people, beating up the other siblings and a month ago, she stabbed her bf in the head twice, and was sent for a mental hygiene. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, yet refuses to take medication or go to therapy. 
Yesterday, she, my father and I went to the store and she was driving. My dad corrects her driving (she has a learners permit) and I notice her mood and shifted. Sidenote: I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease a year ago, and my family knows my stomach is a weak spot. After the correction, she starts bragging about how easy it was to stab her bf, and how she can easily take me and our older siblings in a fight. Before I could get my seatbelt off, she began attacking me and kicking me in my stomach. I throw up, and it winded me. She says ""take that you disease ridden bitch"" I try to fight back but honestly, I am weak, out of shape, and too sick to do a good job.. My father is in the backseat doing nothing. He does not attempt to stop her, he's just yelling. I am no fighter and everyone knows that, especially since I've been struggling with Crohn's. I do end up getting away and I call my husbsnd to rescue me.
Yes, this was one incident, but I know there will be more. My dad cannot handle her, no one can. I can't live in fear, I don't want to be around my family anymore, I truly do not feel safe! I love my dad, but he allows her to act this way and is an enabler. She's out of control. I've already blocked her on everything and I'm considering going no contact with our father..

Some back ground - Around 5 years ago my dad had a breakdown, that none of us saw coming. The past 5 years have been really hard for everyone involved. He’s completely 180’d his life, moved back to his home city from London, quit his company director position to work as a grounds keeper and lives a very isolated life. 
In the midst of the breakdown I was at uni trying to work and study while trying to be there for him as much as I could. I was terrified I would get a call from his wife to tell me he had taken his life. 
I have always been a daddies girl, spoke to him at least 2 times a day, and tried to be the best daughter I could and do everything I could to make him proud. 
9 months ago, he was in what he calls ‘one of his moods’ and we got in an argument which was more him shouting at me, and me just crying. He said I was never there enough for him, I wasn’t supportive, I only wanted him around for his money, I was a terrible person and a despicable human being. The last part broke me. I tried to be there for him to the best of my ability. About a year/ 14 months or so ago, he was supposed to move in with me while he figured out where he wanted to live and do for work- I asked my flat mates to move out so he could come stay - he came for 4 days and left. I was upset he chose to leave but understood he needed to go back to where he felt secure. 
So 9 months ago is pretty much the last conversation I had with him. I spoke to him twice more after, and he doubled down and couldn’t see why I was upset. There was never an honest apology, and any attempt at an apology was more like an excuse - ‘I’m sorry you feel that way but you need to move on’, ‘I don’t I understand why your still upset’, ‘I was in one of my moods, get over it’ 
My issue is, I can’t get over it. He has tried to reach out a couple of times but seeing ‘dad’ come up on my screen has me bursting into tears and feeling sick. I feel exactly the same as when he first said those things 9 months ago. But I miss my dad. He says he misses me too but in the same sentence he says I need to move on. 
I just want to know how. How do I stop crying when I see he’s ringing, how do I stop feeling sick when I even think about reaching out? 
Any advise? ",2,1,1746373662.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kemxfe/dad_called_me_horrible_things_how_do_i_forgive/

1kei8m6,I don't think I like my children any more.,Turbulent-Mousse-828,"I have 3 adult children and went to a birthday lunch with two of them recently.

The other adult child, not at the lunch, moved to another city some years ago chasing a girl he met on a Contiki tour. That relationship is over now and he's taken up with another girl. I say girl but she's 28.   
  
I don't have a problem with him, other than his poor decision to chase the first girl and made it abundantly clear to him at the time he was making a mistake.   
  
My opinion was based on the story he told me where they had been playing the same poker machine but before he moved to live with her permanently.  
  
He put in $50 and they played that out. She put in $50 and they won a $5,000 jackpot. She said it's all hers because it was her $50 that the jackpot was won on. He had to explain it's both their money and she eventually, begrudgingly handed over half the money.  
  
At the time I told him if that was me playing the pokies with her. I would have gotten my money and then shook her hand and wished her all the best for the rest of her life and walked away and I don't understand why he hasn't done the same thing because what she did is a major personality flaw, 

When they broke up, I didn't do a, ""I told you so"". I helped out by buying him furniture as all the furniture in their place was all hers before they met. I also gave him a couple of thousand to make sure he wasn't going to be stressing over money at what was obviously a stressful time.

So back to the birthday lunch with my two other adult children.  
  
I was sharing the story of how renters in my Strata complex were recently evicted because they were constantly parking their car in contravention of by laws, blocking other residents access to their garages. Threatening violence when they were asked to move their vehicles.  
  
I'm on the strata committee and sometimes accompanied other residents to the renters premises a few times as support and to be a witness to any threats of violence or actual violence.   
  
I was saying how they tried staunching up on me a couple of times and how but I bailing them up individually later, some times days and weeks later in secluded parts of the complex and invited them to do what they had threatened but they would never follow through with their threats and claiming they never made them, it was someone else in the house.

I'd end the various confrontations that if the threats are made again. There will be real word physical consequences for them.

Long story short, we were on the verge of taking them to the NSW Tribunal and the owner who is not active on the committee got wind of what was happening. How he never knew from the very first letter sent to his managing Real Estate's office, we have no idea.  
  
He went on an inspection with the Managing agent and told them to stop what they were doing. They told him to fuck off and made threats, So he issued them an eviction the next day, saving us from using Strata fees.

My daughter then said in a sarcastic manner, ""Oh, you're always so tough, that's your answer for everything"", referring to me bailing people up and asking them to follow through on their threats of violence.

I asked her what that means. She then said that when I had a new fence installed a few years earlier and the job was terrible and I insisted on the contractor returning and fixing their horrible work and when the contractor turned up I went out to fight him.  
  
I had to remind her that she was there and we both overheard him telling his workers how he's going to bash me if I come out of the house and of course I went out of the house and told him, ""Here I am"". He did nothing acting puzzled as to why I was there announcing my presence. I told him what I'd heard. He then said he can't work under those conditions left in his work vehicle.

I then explained that's how I learnt from a very young age to deal with bullies, confront them and it's been my experience that they turn to water. To do anything less is to invite repeated bullying from them and that's something I'll never accept.

During that same lunch. I found out that my eldest son is on leave from work for 3 weeks but he's staying home.   
  
As a joke, I said, ""Oh my, I have a million things for you to do at my home. I could fill up the rest of your holidays with work from sun up to sun down but we'll start easy with a 9am start on Monday with some roof work as there are some dead tree branches over hanging the roof which need cutting down. So I'll see you then, which would be wonderful""  
  
I expected my tone was jovial enough to show it was an obvious joke.   
  
I don't actually have anything for him to do as all external work at my home is carried out on the Strata complex's coin. He knows that. He owns and lives in a block of units. 

He said, ""You'll have to pay me"".   
  
I frowned, got serious and said, ""You're joking right?"".   
He said, ""No"".   
I said that's not how it works with family.   
He said it's going to cost him money to drive and stuff.   
I said to leave it because we're just going to argue.  
  
I was looking at him and thinking that's not my son, he should take a long hard look at himself and his values because I don't know where he go the idea that to help family you get paid.

Anyway, the conversations at the birthday lunch has made me question the relationship with those two adult children. 

If they were just friends. I'd be having a stern conversation with my daughter about misrepresenting me as the instigator of the confrontation with the Fencer and insisting on an apology or a see you later, enjoy the rest of your life.   
  
As for my son. Where and how he came to have such a putrid attitude, I have no idea and am ashamed he thinks like that. If he was merely a friend, I don't think I'd be making any more efforts to maintain the relationship.   
  
For me. Family and friends should never hesitate in asking and receiving help. It's an automatic thing as far as I'm concerned.

1kehmy9,Problem w sister,Ida_1992,"I have an older sister (+7 years). We are very different and have always been. She has chosen a life without kids etc while I am in the middle of the toddler period (2 kids). Whenever we see each other I have always felt it’s a bit awkward between us and I have to think a lot about topics to talk about so it doesn’t get stiff etc. For me as an introvert, seeing her takes a lot of my energy as we do not have that natural ”click”. As grownups (me 33, she 40) I feel like hanging out with her is enough on family gatherings (Christmas/birthdays/easter etc) as I like doing things on my spare time that gives me energy, not the opposite.

However, every time when I see her she makes sure to give me a bad feeling for only seeing her every 3rd month. Always making it a thing that we have not seen each other in such a long time, and it’s clear that she want me to feel bad about it and that she would like to meet with us much more often.

Am I the bad one here? Should I invite her over more often even if we don’t feel like it? Is it common sense that you should meet up with siblings once in a while just for the sake of it, even if you are different? I can’t recall that we saw my parents siblings more when we grew up, so I think it’s weird that she makes it to such a big thing? She should understand that we are different, different political views and ways of living and also her husband is in his 50s so it is not like we have so much in common there either.

1keh332,Learned bike riding just a month ago… but I can't balance when my mom sits pillion (posting from second ID because I feel embarrassed),Express-Owl-3169,"

So I learned to ride a bike just a month ago. When I’m alone, everything’s fine — smooth rides, confident turns. But when my mom sits behind me (you know, classic Indian mom side-saddle in a saree), I completely lose my balance. The bike wobbles, my heart races, and I feel like I’m one wrong move away from tipping us both over.

What really hits me is she still helps me. She calmly shifts her weight, keeps encouraging me, even when I’m clearly struggling. And that’s when it hits hard.How do I call myself the man of the family when I can’t even ride properly with my mom sitting behind me?

It sounds silly, but in that moment, I just felt like I failed. Other guys cruise through traffic with two pillions and a sack of rice. Meanwhile, I can’t even manage one ride without stressing.

I know it's just the beginning and I'll get better… but yeah, posting from my second ID because this feels too real for my main.

Anyone else felt something like this?

1keekrm,Scolding other peoples kids?,Illustrious_Tap_1344,"Long read I'm sorry
My eldest has baseball practice every Mon Wed and Fri with games on Sat

I bring my other 3 kids to the playground right next to baseball field to play sometimes while oldest is at practice

There's all kinds of kids there playing from the other baseball families but none of the parents watch them I'm usually the only parent watching my kids
All the baseball moms are kinda friends and hangout together during practice a lil unwelcoming to me
Not sure why


There has been brother sister siblings that usually bully or pick on my children the 6-7 yr old boy we will call Josh  has previously kicked my sons feet out from under him causing him to fall on his back I scolded him and told him that it was not nice or kind and if someone did it to him how would he feel 

and the 4-5yr old girl we'll call trudy tells my girls if they dont do what she says like being mean to other kids or excluding them they aren't her friends, has called another friend of ours the n word, doesn't listen to the word no


But since we're all at baseball it's hard to avoid not playing with Trudy sometimes and they are just kids 
I also try to teach my children that we all make poor decisions sometimes and forgiveness etc.

There was an incident one evening that another girl spit in Trudys hair at the playground Trudy went crying to baseball moms nothing of it

So today at the baseball game 
My daughters went off to ride their scooters one came back and said Trudy and another girl we will call May threw dry dog poop at her face
So I went and investigated no parents around
I asked May if she did it she told the truth but she said Trudy told me to
I communicated calmly why would you listen to her and get in trouble for it 
she apologized and that was it

I asked Trudy why she thought it was ok to throw poop at my daughter and she immediately started crying loud I told her she wasn't in trouble and if someone threw poop at her id do the same thing 
I asked her if she wanted to apologize and her lips locked and she started crying more
I told them we can still be friends we all make mistakes and we should take care of each other
I turned around and started walking off to our spot where we were watching the game 

Mays father passes me and I realize it's her father so I respectfully let him know his daughter threw dry dog poop at my daughter and she was truthful and apologized nothing of it May stays away from my kids 

Trudy continues to interact 
We try to let our children make their minds up for themselves about other people so we aren't banning them from playing with Trudy
They continue to play 
Near the end of game my son informs me that Josh Trudys brother was throwing rocks and baseballs at his face while Im walking to the bathroom i walk out

At this moment Trudy pushes my daughter off a picnic table she was sitting at waiting for me to come out of the bathroom and Josh right next to her 
So once again I tell Trudy don't you do that to her it is not nice what if you got pushed off the picnic table and she locks up and starts wailing loud
And I tell Josh it was not nice that he was throwing rocks at my sons face

While this is happening Mays mom the girl that threw poop at my daughter walks up and hotly asks what's going on because she heard Trudy crying I told her she pushed my daughter off the table and I scolded her

Mays mom says I already scolded them
 
I ask My kids? 

She says all the kids

I tell her this just happened and Josh is throwing rocks at my sons face

Josh interjecting says she was screaming at Trudy

I reply I was not screaming I scolded her and reiterated what I had said to Trudy 

Mays mom says angrily you should talk to the parents first

I reply where are her parents? Her moms not here and her dad is in the field (which is all true and I didn't think she thought I'd know all that but I'm very observant)

At this point Mays mom is visibly upset that I'm even trying to make this a discussion and did not instantly submit to her( I did scold her daughter for throwing poop at my child)

We start to pack up and I hear Josh tell his dad that's her the one that screamed at us

I could tell he was stalling to not have to have a conversation hoping we would just leave first

My daughter left her scooter near the bathroom as I'm walking to grab it Mays mom is staring me down I make eye contact to acknowledge that I can see her staring at me and carry on with my conversation with my daughter

But oh I can tell she's fuming from the way she's puffing on her cigarette 


Josh and Trudy's dad is passing me 
so
I let him know
Respectfully I scolded your kids 
And Mays mom said I should talk to the parents but her moms not here( he scoffed when I said that part) and you were in the field so I scolded them

He asked what they did I told him
I also told him about the previous incident we had of him tripping my son at the park

He asked his son

And he said he did throw balls at my sons face but not rocks 

I don't believe him 
my children rarely ever lie we don't punish for telling the truth even if it was a poor decision 

Then I told him that Trudy pushed my daughter off the table
He said well I heard they spit in her hair 
(now these parents who aren't watching their kids are all talking about what they think my kids did)
I said my kids did not do that
But if they were to ever please let me know or feel free to scold them I tell Josh if any one of my kids ever do something unkind come to me and we will deal with it together 

I tell dad feel free to let me know if I overstepped in any way

I let him know who I am and he says I know (I've never met him before this moment so how? What?)
 He tells me his name and I tell him thanks for the conversation 

I get back to the car and my eldest said that his team mates think his sisters spit in Trudys hair so now all the kids are in on this too? What kind of gossip is going on here

These kids are already using triangulation tactics
And major manipulation it's concerning 
And I have to now feel uncomfortable around baseball events or walk in eggshells

Why do I feel affected by this
Should I done something differently?",5,6,1746345477.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1keekrm/scolding_other_peoples_kids/
1kedb2w,TLDR (?)- I don't understand my sister and I want to help her but is it a good idea.,Crazy_Mechanic_9687,"(Yeah the title is strange sorry)

Hi!

Before I start, I'd like to say that I love my sister. She's the only person (I'm not kidding) in my family that I love. But sometimes I HATE her and have a bad relationship with her.

To give you a bit of background: me (F; 20) and my little sister (19), soon to be 20 in June (we're not twins: me - 2005; her - 2006). As kids, we were super close, really like best friends: we cooked together, played games, watched movies... But that all changed when she went back to high school and got a phone and maybe forty at the Covid. I live with my relatively toxic mother (another story), my half-sister (whom I don't like, but another story), and my sister. My father died in 2022, but I never really appreciated him. Basically, my relationship with my family is complex, but that's not the topic for today 😊

Here's a list of behavior in my sister that I find problematic or even concerning:

•	⁠She's locked in her room all day talking with her friends or being on tik tok. 


•	⁠She doesn't take care of her hygiene: no shower, doesn't take off her make-up, doesn't brush her teeth, keeps her work uniform that smells of restaurant grease. But her hygiene problem goes back a long way (when she was 7-8 years old). 


•	⁠She doesn't clean her room: her study desk is full with make-up products, there are cups of bubble tea and starbucks that are several days or even months old, there are dirty plates everywhere, clothes on the floor, a very strong smell from the perfume and her uniform. 


•	⁠She doesn't understand sharing a common space: the shower is overrun with her products BUT SHE DOESN'T TAKE A SHOWER. I just have three bottles (soap, shampoo, conditioner). •	⁠She doesn't help with the household chores even if I'm at college and I don't have the time, and my mother is permanently injured (work accident). 


•	⁠She gets angry for no reason: my mother or I ask her to clean her room or do the housework (I tell her nicely too), when we encourage her to study (she's in an adult school because she failed high school), when we tell her to come home early or not to go out with her friends from Monday to Sunday, or when we leave her door ajar just to ventilate her room because it stinks. 


•	⁠She's disorganized: when I ask her to pick me up after school or work, she's either an hour late or she's COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN. 


•	⁠She doesn't do her laundry, she's either locked in her room or out with friends. 


•	⁠In connection with these outings, she's bought herself a used car: my family and I don't know where she's going, with whom, and we don't know when she'll be back, which is worrying. She gets off work or school (3:30 or 4:30 pm) and comes home at 1 or 2 am. Then, she has the AUDACITY to be angry under the pretext of “wanting to live her life”. LIKE GURL STF (Sorry). 


•	⁠As for her car, she doesn't take care of it. It's dirty, it stinks, she drives it constantly as if it were new, she doesn't want to look to see if everything's OK (oil, wiper fluid, listen to weird noises, etc). 


•	⁠She refuses to make a doctor's appointment. She says she doesn't know what to do. I didn't know at first either, I just googled it. She doesn't take care of herself, and yet she's anemic but refuses to take a blood test. 


•	⁠I have to wait until she gets home before going to sleep (1am-2am). 


•	⁠I have to call her to tell her to come home, which is clearly not my role. 


•	⁠She doesn't understand that there are reasonable times to come home. 


•	⁠She can be mean and cold to me, whereas I'm nice to her, and I'm constantly defending her in arguments with our mother. 


•	⁠Sometimes she suffers but refuses to talk about it. 


•	⁠She can be manipulative, and it's me who comes across as the “victim” or “slave” of the house because I do everything for her and defend her all the time during arguments with the family. 


•	⁠She only eats junk food. 


•	⁠Before she destroyed my mother's car, which was the ONLY CAR in the house (an accident, but nothing serious, just the bumper, which insurance companies say can't be repaired), she refused to share it with me. For example, when she asks me to drop her off at work or school, or when I pick her up, she wants to drive like I'M THE DRIVER. I've since stopped because it's not fair yk. I understand that she wants to practice but my sister ALWAYS has the car. I only touched that car 10 times before the accident. 


•	⁠Her driving terrifies me: she plays the music so loudly that I can hear it through my sony earbuds wireless WHICH IS NOT NORMAL. She drives super-fast and zig-zags on the freeway because cars drive slowly. What's more, her seat is positioned at a 120-degree angle. HOW DO YOU DO YOUR BLIND SPOTS ???? 

•	⁠It takes her forever to pay me back. 


•	⁠Sometimes she forgets to pay her share of the phone bill (we share a family plan together because it's cheaper). 


•	⁠She's ignorant: she knows nothing about basic history or general knowledge of our world. I tell her “James Crow laws” she doesn't know LIKE GIRL YOU ARE BLACK HOW ???? She doesn't know the dates of the first and second world wars LIKE HOW ???? I know she skipped a lot of classes but this is abusive!!!!

Just to let you know, I ABSOLUTELY don't understand who my sister is. I don't know if this is normal for a little sister or not. She can be nice and all, but I think she abuses my kindness, patience and generosity. Sometimes I wonder if I should cut off all connection with her before I drown and she learns to be an adult (I help her but I can't ALWAYS help her. Like she has to be independent).

I know that everything may seem contradictory but this is my situation🫤

I just want to know if there are people who are going through something similar, or would have any advice.

Thanks so much for reading, and feel free to ask any questions 😊

My father slapped me 5 times on my face not only me but he also slapped my sister and my mother for stopping him . The reason why he slapped me was because I was crying!!!! I hope you all understand academic pressure that we all suffer from,during my class 12 final board exams i couldn't even study properly because of background noise there was constructions going in our neighborhood so because of that I couldn't even study and also was not even able to revise what I have studied ..like there was so much happening in my life I was depressed for the past few months and I have computer class in the evening and distance of my home and coaching is too far most of the time I miss my bus and so I have to walk for like 2 hours to get home and when I reach its already 7pm or 7:30pm , I obviously get tired from all those walking but still I try to complete some of the topics taught in the class but can't like I really can't study in noisy background whenever I asked my family to don't make noise they get hyper especially my father he keeps saying ""can't we even watch tv or talk because you're studying "" I mean they can na but can't they just watch tv or talk without shouting and without making unnecessary noise .. I get home all tired but still I get scold for not doing house chores it's not like I don't work I do as much as I can but I also have my own personal things to get done like studying, homework, assignment and many more 😫 . My father also get hyper whenever I asked him to do anything like he only help in the kitchen twice maybe during my exams and he keep saying like he did every house chores he only help in the kitchen twice only !!! Now in this time of technology we do use phones for notes and study purposes during exams right but even though he knew all of this he still took my charger with him and my phone was dead for 4,5 days straight .. neither was I able to study nor was able to revise what I have studied ... In the examination Hall the questions paper has most of the questions that I have studied earlier but couldn't recall anything due to no revision I could only attempt 2,3 questions properly 💔 . I get frustrated whenever someone asks how my exams was even though they have seen what I was going through they think passing class xii is as easy as passing class x but it's not !! I have decided to repeat my class xii since my examination didn't go well and even inform this to my parents they were like ok do whatever you want but my father keep asking me about my results and keep asking if I have fillup any forms for college 😫 I told him many times that I didn't even do well in my exams I'll fail for sure but again he keeps asking the same thing .. whenever someone reminds me of my exams and results I get depressed and really sad . So today in the morning me and my mother were sitting with my little brother and that's when my father came to me and said did you fill up forms for college I got frustrated there and said why would you keep asking the same thing again and again like I told you already before and so my mother also told  my father that she's not even sure whether she will pass or not atleast wait till the results come out after that father was in the bathroom and mother was just sitting in the living room I went straight to my room and sat silently I felt so sad and miserable 😖 I couldn't hold my tears so I cried cuz I was sad na , I was crying in my room and my mother's phone was in my room she was asking for it so I took the phone and kept there one the sofa where my father was sitting and after he saw my teary face and asked why I was crying so I sad cuz I'm sad , he asked again ""why are you even crying can't I even asked whether if you applied for college or not "" so I said I'm not crying because of what you said I'm crying cuz I'm sad because I couldn't even study and after hearing what I have said he came straight to my room and throw the glass mug and pushed me in my bed slapped me 5,6 times cuz I was crying and said that I was sad 🫠 my mother and sister came straight to my room trying to stop my father but he even slapped my sister and mother.... Aah I can't even explain properly 😖 .... I feel like dying ",0,12,1746335040.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kec1qq/my_father_slapped_me_5_times_on_my_face/
1keafn3,I’m done.,Ill-Divide7525,"I have been the work horse of my family for 10+ years and I’m done. I have always viewed myself as the one who fights for the family and makes sure we are safe. I have helped all family members move on multiple occasions, helped my sister start a business, helped my other sister raise her kids when she had seizures, moved my grandmother single handed from Colorado to Kansas and then my parents as well. I am the steadfast, happy go lucky guy that just makes sure things are taken care of. But today something snapped inside me. Some information about my niece that was R rated in nature was told to me and it was pretty serious, so I asked my niece before going to the police what she would like me to do (she is 18f) and she begged and cried not to because she was embarrassed. Understandable, I let her calm down on my drive home from work and then went and sat in her room. I asked her if there was any truth to this and she started bawling. My sister proceeded to walk in and asked what was going on and I explained the situation and that legal action needed to be taken. My sister started to scream and berate me saying I had no business asking about any of it, that her and her father should’ve taken care of it and that I was way over the Line. I snapped. Something broke. I lost every ounce of respect for my family. Mind you when I graduated highschool my parents split almost immediately.. like next 12 hours for the next 8 years I was on my own. No help, no guidance, just good luck. Nothing has changed since. I have moved myself because my family won’t help me, I am remodeling my home by myself and nobody has bothered to offer to help and with working full time and trying to be active in their lives only to be treated in such a way? I lost it. I calmly walked out, called an attorney and asked for a no contact order to be filed immediately for my sisters family’s. I then called the sheriff and had him trespass my family from my home. I am so sick of making sure everyone in my family is on two feet when I’m crawling on my hands and knees and nobody cares. I changed my phone number immediately (only giving it to my father, whom I respect more than anyone with strict instructions to not pass on the number to anyone in our immediate family) 

I genuinely hope I never hear from them again. The worst, most ungrateful, most conceited people I’ve ever met. I’m ashamed to have the same bloodline. ",1,1,1746329123.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1keafn3/im_done/

She gets angry at this and partially blames me and talks shit about my boyfriend and I also. We've done nothing to my dad and sister and somehow they always find a way to talk shit about us.

1ke725o,Literally feel like an outcast,Living-Dig-1800,"I really don’t want to ramble but to understand my situation I need to start from the beginning. 

I (23 F), got divorced last year and have moved back into my mums house. My brother (24 M) and his wife (23 F) also live there, and they have a son (1 M). 
I actually wanted the divorce because I know it was for my mental betterment, anyway I came back to my family shattered, and they took me back with, what I thought were open arms. 

BTW, my dad isn’t in the picture, he’s separated from my mum but we are super close and keep contact regularly. 

My relationship with my family is fine, my brother was pretty ok with me  and I shared a lot with him, considering our ages, and I respected his wife and tried to always make her feel involved and comfortable in our family. They were there for me at the beginning of my divorce, and I genuinely saw his wife as a sister (big mistake) since I don’t have any, and really shared the pretty and ugly with her of my life. I had good thoughts of her and thought our relationship was fine.

Anywho months pass, and we’ve booked flights to my cousins wedding in the states (I’m from the UK). The first person I told was my SIL, who acted thrilled saying it was great that I’m finally going out again, (before I was hesitant to as a divorcee since I had a lot going on mentally) and that it would be a nice family holiday. 

We got there and that’s when I noticed she was acting weird af. I got ready and asked her how I looked and instead of just expecting her to be like “oh you look pretty” she make a weird comment about how I draped my shawl or whatever.  I just tried to brush it off and laugh, and the trip went on. 

Anyway she just lessened talking to me, I mean, 8/10 times I would always try to initiate conversation with her and overtime she just stopped… engaging with me? I was like what the hell. Anyway I started noticing it with my brother too, not my mum though.

After having a moment alone with my brother he ends up saying how I ruined things by getting divorced, coming back here and being a burden on their heads as if I am a literal HINDERANCE to their lives. Like, my dad financially supports me firstly. Secondly, this “house” that we’re all in is under my MUMs name. If I really wanted anything at all I would’ve appreciated maybe some company, ask how I am and how I’m feeling. Also he exposed himself about how his wife was chatting crap about me behind my back about my situation, and you can imagine how my stomach just sank hearing that. 

His wife slowly disincluded me in the things we used to do like watch movies, talking etc. She would even invite her sister round (I had no issue, but it hurt because I felt like a cold shoulder was being turned to me) and put movies on and not call me up to watch. 

Then I just thought this is literal BS. By the way, I did NOTHING, hell I even told my friends that my sibling and his wife are being so supportive during this time, so I decided to bring his wife into my room and just ASK her, why was she acting like that and why was she trash talking about me when I did nothing? 

Anyway short answer is that she doesn’t like my personality. Went on to say stuff such as “I don’t think we can have a relationship because you’re too “out there”… um ok. She also went onto admitting that she felt “disheartened” upon hearing that I was joining the fam for the US family holiday. Even though during that time I was ironing her clothes, washing her makeup brushes and just doing things literally out of the kindness of my heart. 

Honestly guys this is just an ounce of it. People whom I’ve told have said this is how brothers are after marriage and whatever but given the way they are now, they don’t even talk to me, tell me I can’t eat from their freezer and have set all these boundaries as if I am literally an imposter living among them. My mum is too old to speak up to my brother, she’s in her 60s, my brother doesn’t even care about her opinion when it comes to me anyway. Truthfully they want me gone, out of their living space, and being called a burden just sums it up really. 

To remind you, I am the DAUGHTER of that house, and I can’t live with my dad as he can only afford rent for a 1 bed, he’s not so well off anymore and supports me weekly with minimal allowance just to help me get by. I am currently job hunting but I don’t want to be forced out because I genuinely thought my mums house was a safe space. I want to take my time to heal, get back on track and then think about moving out. 

Can someone actually dissect this for me, I’m open to criticism on my end but can someone help me on what the hell is going through my bro and his wife’s head? And what would ideally be the best thing to do.

1ke6nvu,When Mother’s Day and mom’s birthday collide,Practical-Funny-5149,My birthday always falls within a few day’s of Mother’s Day (sometimes it’s actually on Mother’s Day). My family has started referring to this week as “hell week” for them. I feel like I’m a pretty low maintenance wife and mom when it comes to gifts and celebrations or anything involving me so it really hurts my feelings that they treat me like a burden every year. I put a lot of effort into their birthdays and holiday experiences. I do it because I love them and I don’t expect this to be reciprocated in the same ways but I also don’t expect to be treated like this. Am I being sensitive for taking their comments to heart?

1ke5p97,Worried about family's health...,black4lt,"I saw a similar post within this subreddit, but it was years ago so I suppose I want to open up the conversation once again,

As the title says- I am a little worried for my families health. Here is the thing... growing up amidst my family we have had a bit of an unhealthy lifestyle/diet. It was what I have known since I was born. It wasn't until the previous few years where I decided for myself that I wanted to become more healthy. Granted, it has taken me some trial, error, and experience to bring me to where I am now.

I have been living pretty much on my own for the past few years, but now I am residing with my family for a bit. Coming back I soon recognized our house's eating habits... many of the things in the house I could not or would not eat. Then on top of that, take out and eating out makes up majority of their diets.

However, it is not just their diets I am worried about. For example, my mother, in her 50's, often has a hard time getting up or sitting in chairs due to her weight. Often times me or my brother would have to help her up. We are at an age where we both are probably going to move out soon... when we aren't here I worry how it would be for her to get around when she already struggles.

People make their own choices for their lives and don't make changes unless they really want it for themselves, I get that. I have lived it. However, I also see the health problems that have arisen within my family as well. High blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, joint pain... I worry about their longevity. If I have kids one day, I would like for them to meet their grandchildren and be part of their lives. If I get married one day, I would like for them to be present for that moment. For accomplishments and opportunities, I want to be able to share those experiences with them for as much as I can. So I worry for their health and ability to get through life as we both get older. If nothing changes, then these problems are just going to become worse.

Another thing to mention... amidst my journey towards prioritizing health, I have lost a good bit of weight. I really don't want to seem like that one nagging person who loses weight and comments on other peoples lives. Like good for me- but other peoples life is their life. However, I often think about if there is a way I could bring up my concerns with my family about this. Within my journey if I had some better help, guidance, and compassion instead of all the trial and error I ran into, things would have been so much easier.

I suppose I am trying my best to lead by example as well, but I'm not really seeing any effect from that either.

Has anyone else been in this position? Could you share your experience, maybe some advice?

1ke4h0s,Does anyone else finding it difficult traveling on vacation with your parents as an adult?,Fantastic-Ad9218,"I’m a 39 year old single male and only child. And because I’m a single male, I don’t really have people to travel on vacation with. I’ve traveled solo a few times, but my parents try to stop me by telling me to travel with them as a family instead of going solo. But the last couple of times I’ve traveled with my parents, it’s frustrating and annoying. They are disorganized, they get lost easily and they are always indecisive about where to eat, and sometimes, I’m going hungry on the trip. And on top of that, they refuse to accept help from me because they feel they know it all, so I’m constantly walking with them and getting lost, and I just have to tag along with the nonsense.

As pathetic as it may seem, when I travel solo, I have an amazing time. But with my parents, it’s torture. I know I should try to appreciate my parents while they are still around, but it’s very difficult dealing with their lack of organization and them looking at me as a kid, refusing to accept help and guidance from me. And I’m sorry if my frustration makes me a bad person. I try very hard to go away with them and be as patient as possible, but it’s too hard. I’m just so used to having everything planned ahead and organized when I’m traveling solo, so I cannot tolerate the mess of a vacation that my parents put together.

Is it just me, or does anyone else have this experience when traveling on vacation with your parents as an adult? And do you think it’s better that I travel solo going forward, even tho it’s a bit pathetic to do so?

TL;DR- As a 39 year old adult male, it’s very hard traveling on vacation with my parents, as they are very disorganized and they don’t plan ahead. They get lost easily on where they are going and what to do, and they refuse to accept guidance and help from me. As a result, my vacation ends up being a disaster. When I travel solo on my own and plan ahead, I always have a good time, surprisingly.

1ke3ph3,"My brother is pressuring me and bullying me to repay a £20,000 loan I didn’t take.",ChangeConstant5649,"I’m in a really stressful situation and don’t know what to do. Over a year ago, one of my brothers asked me to ask our other brother for a £20,000 loan as they’ve always had strained relationship . I passed the request on, and my brother agreed to lend him the money he really needed it. 

Since then, the brother who borrowed the money hasn’t been able to pay it back. Now, the brother who gave the loan is pressuring me to repay it. He claims I personally promised to pay it back, which I don’t remember doing. 

I’ve already paid him £5,000 out of my own pocket just to try and ease the situation, even though I’m struggling myself. I was out of work for over a year and I’m in debt too — but my family doesn’t know because it’s a long and complicated situation, and I’ve never felt able to open up about it.

He keeps harassing me at home and saying I’m lying about my financial situation. My parents don’t get involved, and I feel completely stuck and isolated.

What makes it worse is that the brother who borrowed the money has helped the one who loaned it many times before — financially and otherwise. But the one who loaned the money seems to have forgotten that and now just wants his money back from me. And to be clear, he’s not struggling financially — he wants the money back to use for an investment.",8,5,1746307839.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ke3ph3/my_brother_is_pressuring_me_and_bullying_me_to/

1ke0s95,"The woman who suffered a broken leg during the riots at the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania store during a 1983 cabbage patch doll riot.",WaterExtension4013,"Some people may be curious about her, so I'll talk here about her, because she's literally my GREAT-AUNT.

In 1983, Dorothy J. Swainbank, 47, was injured while trying to buy a cabbage patch doll for her granddaughter, Ashlee. I'll tell you her story, so people on the internet can stop asking me.

Born, Dorothy Jane Roper on February 26, 1936, in Wilkes-Barre to George and Ethel (Fritzinger) Roper, she was one of 12 children.

During the great depression, in 1949, Dorothy lived in a small apartment with her siblings. Sharing rooms as her brother, Jonas, worked 40 hours a week as a machine operator to support the family.

Dorothy was extremely happy-go-lucky and would forgive anyone for anything. She loved kids, and weddings, and they always seemed to bring a tear to her eye.

Dorothy married a Veteran named Harry Daniel Swainbank shortly after her father's death. They had a son, John Robert, on Easter 1955, and on New Years Day, 1957, had a son, James Edward. 21 days later, as she was trying to put a new nappy on James, she noticed how James was starting to turn yellow. She awoke Harry and rushed James to the hospital. He reported to have died of Kidney Failure, but his death certificate says Bowel Obstruction. and in 1958, came a daughter Carolyn, named after her sister Caroline. She lovingly called Carolyn ""Sissy"" and the name caught on. Then in 1960 gave birth to her daughter, Nancy, who inherited her mother's caring nature. In 1962, Dorothy prematurely gave birth to a son, Lewis Edward. His cord was wrapped tightly around his neck, and his lungs quickly filled with fluid. He died, just 10 hours old.

In 1963, Dorothy had a son named Donald, and later gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Susan in 1966. Later having kids, David Thomas, in 1967. And Cherri Ann, in 1970.

Dorothy, after the broken leg, On December 30th, lost a infant granddaughter, Corrine.

After this, Dorothy lived a quiet life, working for a child service center. Her husband Harry died in 2000 at the age of 72, and Dorothy 2 years later, while in the back of a car going to Knoebels, she had a heart attack. And she passed away at 66.",3,3,1746299791.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ke0s95/the_woman_who_suffered_a_broken_leg_during_the/
1ke0j8d,SIL said yes we can bring our niece to Hawaii but has now changed her mind 3 months before our trip. Please help me convince her to allow our  niece to come with us,Alohaohana4,"Aloha Ohana! A little background, my husbands side of the family grew up never going any where except camping for vacation. I am completely the opposite, I have been many places all around the world and even before my mom remarried she took me and my sister all over Europe as a single mom. When I met my husband 15 years ago I introduced him to not only vacationing but really traveling and immersing yourself in other cultures. Anyways now that we are married and have our own little family we go on multiple trips a year. I love my nieces so much and treat them as my own, due to fertility issues, we were blessed to have one wonderful awesome kid! My husband and I love kids and wanted a big family. So maybe we are a bit much but we make the effort to go out of our way to spend time with our nieces who live 2hrs away. Especially over summer break when they don’t have school. When we host our nieces and nephews we load up on favorite snacks, make sure they have clothes at our house, tooth brush, everything! We drive to pick them up and bring them back home. We just want it to be an easy and make sure their parents know the kids are safe and loved when they spend the weekends with us. Now that they are a bit older, I invited the kids and parents to come to Hawaii with us. My SIL and BIL said they couldn’t take off work, money, etc. we offered to pay for my nieces flights and everything.  They thought about it and a month later they agreed  they were comfortable with my older niece coming with us. My MIL said she would come too. My MIL was the primary care giver before my niece started school and now does pick up and drop off to school and extra curricular stuff. So of course we are hyping our niece up, showing her pictures from prior trips, snorkeling, food etc. she is super excited and we are super excited! First part of the tip we are staying at Aulani, we are big Disney people. Second part will be in the North shore. Everything was booked about 9-10 months ago. Until we get a surprise a few days ago that my SIL is now not comfortable with her going to Hawaii with us, 3 months before our trip. My niece is heart broken and calls me crying on FaceTime. As her Auntie I really have no grounds since I’m not her mom and I would never talk down about people to their kids. We do want to have a heart to heart with our SIL and BIL privately and see if there is anyway she can still let her go. We are all disappointed, I’m sure not as much as my niece. Basically my SIL is now saying since it’s my niece’s first time on a plane, a parent should be with her, it’s not fair we aren’t taking her other little one, and just so many random excuses. She even went as far to  say she never agreed. My SIL does struggle with low self esteem and anxiety so I don’t know is that’s contributing to her change of mind. But I dunno if there anything I can try to say or do to change her mind. I’m so heartbroken for my niece and I feel bad that we got her hopes up cause we thought we were really good to go.

I’ve found this to be incredibly stressful for me as I barely have time to sit and relax with my husband. If I were to miss a weekend, she would ask if I’m stopping over during the week because “she hasn’t seen me in so long” and jokes that she doesn’t remember what my face looks like anymore. I tried to sit her down and calmly talk about my own feelings and set some boundaries, which quickly devolved into me crying and leaving as my brother (35M), screamed at me that if I didn’t want to be there then to just get out. For some background, I almost never see or talk to my mother without my brother around. He has severe, undiagnosed and untreated mental issues. He does not work, and the only reason he isn’t living with her is because she gave him my grandparents house and she supports him entirely. I’m not saying he doesn’t contribute, he visits her daily, often stays over, will cook for her and keeps up with her yard work, all of which I very much appreciate. Financially, however, he’s completely dependent on her; he does not work and only really leaves the house to go to hers, essentially a block away. I think this also skews how often they think they need to see me (my brother made it very clear that he thinks I do not visit enough either), because they always see each other and pretty much only each other. My dad passed away a few years ago, and he was the only one who would have had my back in situations like this. Then my mom retired and she really doesn’t go out either. I’ve invited her to things and she either declines right away or tells me she will and then backs out at the last minute. All she seemingly wants is for me to go over to her house and sit and stare at her and my brother for hours while we eat and play the same card game. After my attempt at setting boundaries, I blocked her for a couple of days and she eased up a bit. I now only have to see her one day every other weekend and call her a few times a week. While this is better, she’s kept with the theory that if I miss a day, I should stop by after work to make it up the following week. Which… I just don’t always have in me. Any other attempts I’ve made to revisit this topic never go well. I started therapy to try to sort out this issue along with my general mental health, but my therapist seemed to focus more on seeing things from my mom’s POV and rather how I was dealing with my brother being the way he is and refusing to seek his own mental care help. If we’re being honest, I hardly think about my brother outside of when I’m going to my mom’s. Maybe that’s terrible, maybe I’m terrible. I do love my mom, and I hate disappointing her, and she also helps me out financially whenever I’m in a pinch (like if something is wrong with my car and money is a little tight, she offers to help pay the garage fees; I don’t even have to ask). I don’t want to ruin my relationship with her, I just wish I could see her when I felt like it/ felt I had the opportunity, so it felt less like a chore. I told her I was skipping this weekend since Mother’s Day is the following, but now we’re trying to see if we can make it to my MIL’s too for that day, and I’m waiting for that to be an issue for my mother. We hardly ever see my MIL as she lives about an hour and a half away from us, whereas my mother is about a 15-20 minute drive. How can I set boundaries that feel healthy for me without crushing my mom? If I tell her the truth: I’m too stressed/ tired/ busy, she either tells me to come over during the work week then or that I need to drop one of my hobbies/ social activities.

1kdvbzv,Still no child support after 9 months?,OkCheesecake7067,"My sons father and I split up about 10 months ago and I filed for child support 9 months ago. I recently had to quit my job due to lack of childcare. The person who use to watch him had a life change where she can't watch my son anymore and government assistance for daycare never came in. I got emails of them claiming I did not call them for the interview when i DID call them. And head start is full. We live with roommates now cause we were desperate and we were homeless after the break up and government housing is full everywhere and has an overloaded waiting list. And no I can't stay with family they don't want me cause my evil mother convinced all of them that I am crazy cause she doesn't believe me about my abusive step dad. 

There is a no contact order between me and my sons father. He got bailed out after only one night. I was not on the lease which is why I could not stay at the house after the break up.

I was told by the workers at the child support office that he has been ignoring their letters. Do they eventually just take it from him even after he keeps ignoring them? We were never married but his name is on the birth certificate and I know he is the father cause I never cheated on him and our son looks a lot like him and we were already together for several months before we got pregnant. 

When I called the victims advocate to ask if he had the court date already for DV she said no. Why would it take over 9 months for a court date with a no contact order if he got bailed out after only one night? 

I don't know if he is planning on getting back together or if he wants to pay child support without the courts involved like he did with his other kids mom or what. 

I was told by the child support office that they set a court date for him for child support. I asked them what happens if he doesn't go and she said they will keep serving him and eventually might take his drivers license away. Well if they take his his license that would be bad because even though he has a good job he also uses uber eats as a side job whenever he needs extra money.

I dont know if I should just put our son up for adoption or what. Some of the workerd at the  DV shelter even told me to go back to my ex because they knew I had nowhere else to go.",2,17,1746285454.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdvbzv/still_no_child_support_after_9_months/
1kduqfq,I’m the blacksheep,ComprehensiveWall813,"I've always been at odds with my parents, from the time I'd say I was 7 or so. Always in trouble, ignored when I wasn't. My sister burst on to the scene when I was about that age. Things went downhill rather quickly. They went from ignoring me to becoming total control freaks. It was bad, but when I was 13, it just got worse. I left home at 17, two days before Christmas after a physical fight with my dad, and I didn't look back for a long time. I graduated, by couch surfing. My sister once came to me and asked me, if I would take care of her, if she could move in with me because she couldn't stand living with them anymore. I said yes, and that seemed to be the plan...till they bought her tickets to concert that year. Then all of a sudden they were okay in her book and she started having issues with me as well. 
My cousins aren't really my age, so there's not a lot of love lost there. Still though, it would be nice if I wasn't looked down on for my mental health and being on disability. Maybe had dinner with them on occasion? You know, being a family? lol.
My grandpa is my one constant support in my life, but our last few conversations have been stressful. All he wants to talk about is Afghanistan 20 years ago. He doesn't understand, that rehashing war stories isn't fun for me. Matter of fact, he brought it up two weeks ago. I was supposed to have breakfast with him today, but I bailed. I'm legitimately sick but even if I wasn't, I wasn't going to go. Who the fuck wants to talk about that stuff over pancakes? I'm good. His current wife used to like me, but she's on the bandwagon too now. 

Now some of this stuff, I have earned. For example, my brother in law and I got into it a couple days after thanksgiving this past year. I was not invited, for the 3rd year in a row. So I ask just kinda causally like ""hey bro, did you forget something?why?"". Now I didn't expect it to be that big of a deal till he started swearing at me, told me no one wants me around, that he didn't care about me one way or another etc. I took this punk ass on his first ever camping trip (seriously), bought him a pocket knife. He's always going on and on about how we're family and it's importance etc 
And that's the response I get?! Fuck that. So I went off on him and well, I definitely burned that bridge. I made sure he'd never want to talk to me again...and that one I really don't feel bad about. Fuck him and my sister 🤷‍♂️ (that imo he married for citizenship but hey ya know whatever). 

I'm just tired of it all falling apart. I don't know why my family is like this but I really wish that wasnt the case

1kdtybr,Advice on Sons Sexual Condition,,"Hey all, this is a throw away account obviously. 

Single mom of 2 teens here. I have a daughter thats 17 and a son that's 16. I would appreciate if anyone had any advice on how I could deal with this embarrassing situation with my son. I feel like I've done a good job explaining sex to my kids and would consider myself a ""sex positive"" parent. We've discussed various topics in our house for the sake of education. My kids feel comfortable and not embarrassed to express to me anything they need or have questions about. My apolgies for the long winded post but I wanted to establish as much as I could.

So recently my son told me that he has a really sore feeling in his testicles and that it has been the case for over a day. Our immediate thought was maybe he injured himself in gym class or sports since he is involved in a few. It was late at night so my instict was to rest up and see how he felt in the morning, if it continued I would take him to a doctor. 

Next morning I asked him how he was feeling and he said he was fine and that it went away. Figured it was just a sports injury and told him to be careful.

Maybe a week later, he said it was happening again, just as bad as before. He said he is been extra careful and was really sure he didnt hurt himself. I asked him to examine his test and see if he noticed anything unusual, maybe anything abnormal. Nothing other then them just being really tender. I told him same as last time to rest up and see if it helps as it seemed to work last time. Next morning he woke up and still had same issue, so I let him stay home from school and I scheduled a doctors appointment for later in the afternoon. He went back to bed, and maybe an hour later I went to check on him and he was getting changed, I asked how he felt and he said he feels OK now. He slightly embarrassed expressed to me that he had a nocturnal emission while he was having a nap. He also said it happened the last time this happened a week prior. Both times the pain went away.

So yeah turns out that pain was a pretty severe case of ""blue balls"" for lack of a better term. I asked if he's felt that pain in the past, and he said he has as of more recently. The two times he told me about were the most intense they've been and he doesnt think it should be happening so much and have that much pain. I understand it's normal for hormones to be raging at that age, but definitely seems not normal for pain and the frequency of it.

So, I took him to a physician who has worked with my kids since childhood, I figured it would be less awkward. She and I have developed a good relationship. I filled her in and she recommended that he come in for a physical and a semen sample/measurement.

I had to schedule for like 4 days later. So we go to the doctors, his physical is great. I was in the room with him throughout that. Then came time for the sample. His was given a sort of measuring cup with a lid. He had a private room that he could take care of it in. The doctor left, I stayed in the exam room, and son went into the private room. A little later, he came back with the cup and it was quite filled to say the very least. The doctor eventually returned and she was even surprised about the amount.

To make a long story short, it turns out that my son has what is called hyperspermia. Basically an excess production of seminal fluid. Essentially there are no health risks associated other than the potential for fertility issues (which is not something that is to be a concern of his any time soon). She said she is not sure if this a simply a phase or something that will be a condition of his long term, but she said she wouldn't be surprised if it was something that lasted just throughout his teens due to raging hormones. When asked about how much volume come out when he releases, he said usually anywhere from 10-15 spurts on average. Apparently he can be reset and release the same amount within half a day.

I asked what she though the best approach is in this situation and how I should handle with him. She said that she cannot advise how we handle it at home, but it was her recommendation that he releases at least twice a day for the next 2 weeks to see if it helps and to track any changes in how he feels or how much he releases. She also reccomended that I reach out to a sexual health or family specialist to see what their thoughts on the situation are.

So as awkward of a situation this is, how do I go about handling this? This was yesterday, I talked to my son and said as of now just make sure you are releasing regularly. Do I advise a routine for him? Should I be any more involved/how involved should I be? How do we deal with the hygiene and clean-up?

1kdswtp,My family still asks me for money even though I moved out—and they don’t even know I’m unemployed,FvckinWalkinParadox,"I left teaching in 2023 to get away from my emotionally draining and financially exploitative family. I moved to the city to start fresh and finally focus on building my own life. One of the biggest reasons I left was because I was constantly being asked for money—even though I was barely holding things together myself. I was the one paying the bills, buying groceries, and holding down the fort, all while my own needs were pushed to the side.

Now I’m no longer living in that house, I don’t benefit from it in any way, and I haven’t told anyone I got laid off recently. But guess what? They’re *still* asking for money. Even my uncle, who has a kid and a job, feels entitled to ask me for help. Meanwhile, my sister, who’s also working and *living* in that house, doesn’t get nearly the same pressure I do.

It’s like no one’s adjusted to the fact that I’ve left. In their minds, I’m still the one responsible for holding everything up—even when I’m crumbling and trying to quietly rebuild myself. I feel like I'm only now starting life for real because I’ve been conditioned to always put my family first. But I can't keep sacrificing my future to patch up theirs.

I don’t want to keep giving money, especially now that I'm unemployed. But I also feel guilty because I know how things are back home. I also don’t know how to set boundaries without triggering a family fallout or being called selfish.

1kds606,My mother is avoiding me when I come over and visit her.,,"Hey all,

I have recently had a falling out with my mother, and it's something that I have been very vigilant and observant about, but also bit my tongue on for quite some time. Only recently have I lost my cool with her, which led to a falling out between her and myself.

When I come over to see my Mom (she works from home in the living room) during her working hours within weekdays (we are neighbours as I live one second away from her home), even when she's not busy and free away from calls and meetings within her working hours (which most of the time that's the case for her so she's chilling anyway), she either invites me in into her house or I will ring on her door to see if she's alright and just check in really, and instead of being an active listener and showing interest in our conversation, she immediately walks away and starts cleaning, hoovering, doing something without showing her face (but of course, she continues to drag the conversation by shouting over the rooms in her house as that's her way of communicating) directly at me that she is willing to listen. She then proceeds to go into the kitchen, and I have to raise my voice so she can hear me. In all honesty, it sounds a bit daft, but it feels like I am speaking to her ghost or the wall. Not very respectful, I think. And this is something that doesn't just happen with me, but also with my grandmother (since she and I share our home), and she also deals with a similar situation.

My mother (and I can't speak on her behalf) seems to be *always* busy and always on the go, but it can get out of hand, especially when you want to chill out with her and spend some quality family time, even when it's already been planned and is happening in the moment.

My mother was also very absent when I was born, she was extremely busy and away from the country due to her work demands and responsibilities. My father got up and went to the store to get some milk (ygm), and raising me was left to my grandparents (my mother's parents). So again, my mother was out of the picture for some time. She was only there temporarily, like blips in my memory banks, and then she'd go elsewhere.

One example here is - I took my Mom out for a coffee in a nice, fancy 5-star hotel restaurant a few months back. Within about sitting for roughly 15 minutes or so, my mother goes to me ""Drink up, we have to get going."" and I look at my watch and tell her ""What's the rush? Have you got to be someplace somewhere now?"" and she reponds ""No..."" and goes silent.

I have tried to tell her she has got to switch off because it seems like she's in a constant rush, 24/7, and then struggles to deal with stress management and her stuff. I guess that's how her mind works, and each to their own, but it feels sometimes very cold to just get to know her on a deeper level and spend some time with her, mother to son.

I'm 23 and she's 45, so she's relatively a young mother, but even then, when she isn't working or doing something that's in her diary/schedule or agenda for the day, she seems to be always caught up in something, or be ""aggressively"" interested in tackling another task out of thin air which hasn't been spoken about, for instance she's extremely impulsive with decision making on the spot, and each decision is always met with this *whooosh* of aggression and **IT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW** kind of attitude, if you get me. She likes to be hard working, even when the time isn't there, but it's hard to socialize and bond with her.

My late grandfather (my mom's father), when he was alive, also had a very similar mindset and attitude as my mother, only he was more rational and sensible sometimes. I know my grandfather spent a lot of time with my mom whilst she was growing up, which might have had an impact on her personality in her later years, since he raised her more as a son than a daughter, and maybe this is my mothers' internal everlasting grievance towards him by her adapting her personality and attitude in life to him (she even tells me and my grandmother when she does things, for example ""it's what he'd do"", like trying to be a reincarnation or second version of him or something), which further escalates into situations like these where my mother isn't being very motherly, and it's very hard to bond and spend time with her.

Anyway, so a couple of days ago, I had a small ""crashout"" of sorts, by acting the same way and mirroring her behavior back towards her, when she came over to my house this time (to see my grandmother), and she then had a go at me and started asking me ""What's wrong?"", where I simply said ""I'm just acting and behaving the way you do, because I've had enough."" and I walked away. She, of course, was taken back by this and retaliated by talking to herself, and she walked off and left the house. That was the last time we spoke.

Apologies for this long-winded story, but I just don't know what I should do...

Am I being the A\*\*hole here, or is she in the wrong? Do I reach out to her first and apologize, or do I wait for her to come around and sit down with me?

1kdrjde,"I lost five of my kids. My parents, my sister, my brothers, my husband.",WaterExtension4013,"Hello. My name is Claire, and I'm 86 years old. I've been thinking a lot about my kids, and my family. So I wanna talk about my life with them

I was born May 24, 1938 in Pennsylvania, to my parents Charles and Catherine. My dad was a WWI Veteran. My parents married in 1929. I had a infant brother who died in 1930.

I had one brother and one sister growing up. Mabel and Bobby. I was closest with Mabel, but Bobby just went to work and misbehaved. My mom would cheat on my dad after I was born, so she was never home. And my dad was very, very sick. Me in my youth, I started fighting constantly with  my sister, and sneaking out of the house when dad put me to bed to drink and smoke, I was 16 at this point. My sister got married to my brother-in-law, who was my future husband's brother. I also once dated Mabel's late husband, Jonas, who was 7 years my senior. My sister Mabel once dated, diamond king, Tony Van Scoy by the way, and dated my future husband.

I snuck out of my house sometime after my 17th birthday, and met up with my future husband John, who was 22 at the time. And we did some this, and I was knocked up with my eldest son, John Jr. So my dad forced marriage on us on October 28,1955, me and John got married. My son was born on June 9, 1956. And my sister had a little girl in September, and we'd push strollers together and they thought that my niece and my son were twins. My son was very sweet, and close with my niece, even in adulthood.

My husband treated me nicely,and I was invited to come to his HUGE family reunions.

I gave birth to my son Robert Thomas, in 1958,  it was around this time, me and Mabel moved next door to each other in the County and it was the best. And after this, in 1960, I gave birth to my first baby with wings, Brian, and he had his stomach on the outside of his abdomen. He passed three days later which broke my heart badly. My niece named her son after my late son Brian. Then I gave birth to my daughter, Louise Marie in 1963.

The same year, my dad died of a heart attack as my sister's youngest daughter sat on his lap. My mom threw herself into her cooking, and she was good at it, BIG TIME. I miss it. After my dad died, my brother quit his job to live with my mom. He robbed her, kicked her, and one time shoved her down the stairs. This went on for many years afterwards. In 1964, I miscarried twin girls, and my husband John left the 109th Field Artillery after this to focus on me and his family, getting a job with his brother Jonas as a part-time police officer. And in 1965, I gave birth to my daughter Kathleen, who died the next day. She couldn't breathe, and it was hard seeing her next to me like that, and the image of her pained face haunts me 60 years later. This time, I didn't grief, I went into shock, so I decided, no more kids. My three were enough. In 1968, my sister in law, Rebecca passed away, followed by her brother Toots in 1970. they both had young kids, my husband was one of 12.

My mom died in 1977 of a heart attack. My brother refused to call an ambulance and she passed away. She was 65. My brother ran off, and I never saw him again. And I was around my sister more than ever, we had such deep conversations, and I miss her terribly. And later in 1985, my brother-in-law Jonas passed away. It broke my husband, they were close, always working together. I became a grandmother in 1978, which is something I always loved, her name is Karen. Around this time, I left my job, and John and I enjoyed retirement early. Now it's just weddings and grandchildren. And in 1995, my husband went for a surgery for a blood clot on his shoulder, and it went to his brain and quickly burst, and my husband died of a stroke. And it took me a while to get myself together, and around Christmas 1996, my eldest son called me from South Carolina, because he had taken an overdose of pills to kill himself, and wanted to call me to say goodbye. He died before getting to the hospital, and I didn't utter a word until 1997 until when my great-granddaughter Ashlya, was born. Shortly after my son died, his daughter Karen, had a baby girl. And I learned to talk again.

In 2002, I got a call that my brother had died, and wanted me to claim his remains. I told him to keep the body, so now he is in a state cemetery with his wife Mary. Although he was a terrible man, I grew up around him, and it still sucked.

My sister was diagnosed with Dementia in 2009, and passed three years later, which I couldn't take it anymore. We spent almost 70 years by each other's side. At the point I had 9 great-grandchildren, and I now have 15 or 16. While my sister had great-great-grandchildren. And i forgot to mention, my sister ran a daycare, where a disabled boy drowned in 1995, and my sister was hated by our town. And it was wrongful, it was mean because it was an accident. I had stuff thrown at me because I was her sister, and I had to do my shopping at night, and my husband had just died. So it was very hard.

And now, here. In March of 2025, my daughter Louise put me in a nursing home. I fought for a while, but I'm getting too weak to fight back. In a few years and months, I'll be with my children, because I might have Alzheimer's Disease just like my sister did. And I'm ready to go up to them. I've lived a happy and long life, and I wanted to share my story because it truly is long, and it's just very fun to live with such a good family.

1kdmvbm,I know my dad is cheating on my mom. What should I do?,StyleOk6406,"

I (19F) am currently in first year college and have either of my parents staying with me at my place here (please don't question, it's normal in our culture). Basically, I have my mom staying with me for a week, and then my dad another, week (alternating). Recently, I've been seeing my dad chatting late at night on Twitter (based on the layout) when he doesn't openly share the fact that he has a Twitter account with us (In our country, the primary messaging app is also Facebook). I've been seeing this for a few nights now, wherein I'd see him chatting with someone. Only recently did I confirm it by checking his phone when he was away (it was even a hidden app. I was only able to check it through the playstore). It was a bunch of flirty messages. Before, around the first semester of college, I also caught my dad having another phone. I don't know where it was or where it is, but since his email was signed in on my phone, I got a notification of a new device I didn't know of (same location, at a time where I was in school).

Now, my parents already had history with cheating — back in 2018, it was my mom who cheated on my dad. I was too young to realize then but I too found out when I saw my mom's open computer tab on a dating website (a few years back before 2018). After that, for a good five years, there was domestic violence in our home. I've literally seen the knife, blood, and physical assault multiple times. They're okay now though, but it still haunts me a lot of times (there are times where I wake up crying because of a dream of them fighting). My dad is also very narcissistic and ill-tempered (outside of the cheating incident), he wouldn't own up to mistakes all the time and would resort to verbally hurting us or screaming. He also only follows himself and what he wants. There were also times where he ashamed us in public. 

Also, my mom would sometimes make remarks recently, how he has a ""best friend"", in a sort of way where she probably knows about something. I don't know what she knows, or how she knew about it. I would also catch her on my dad's phone sometimes when he leaves his phone on some desk. My mom's not that good with phones, though, so I'm not sure if she knows about my dad's hidden apps.

I'm just wondering what I should do. It's been eating me up inside now whenever I have nothing to do (distracting myself still works, luckily). I'm not sure if I should tell my mom given my father's tendencies and I'm afraid everything we've experienced before will go back again. I definitely do not want to see the image of my mom being hurt by my dad again, while I stand there helpless and crying.

Also, now, my dad's insisting that my sister (16F) come with us at my place this week since she's on school vacation. My mom's gonna be with me this week, while my dad would have to stay at home (all four of us can't stay there because of our dogs back home. it's also too far for him to just go to and from my living space daily). I don't know what his plans are, but I'm scared it'll make me feel worse.

Please help me :(",5,3,1746255469.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdmvbm/i_know_my_dad_is_cheating_on_my_mom_what_should_i/
1kdmh0p,I keep getting annoyed at my brother for no reason and I know it's wrong,AdvantageAway8271,"I love my brother. My brother and I are close, I always talk and ask him for advice whenever I have problems. He does not get angry whenever I get in trouble and always tries to guide me correctly. That's what kind of a brother he is.

But lately I've been getting annoyed whenever he interacts with me, whenever he simply asks questions I get annoyed, he asks me to do something I get annoyed, etc... But I'm not outright hostile towards him, just when he approaches me I get annoyed somehow and I don't know what's causing it, I know it's wrong and I need to fix my attitude.
One of the reasons I think on why this has been happening lately is because this is the family dynamic we're used to. Ever since we were kids I've been like this to him, as I got older I realized what I was doing was wrong and I stopped the habit of getting annoyed at him. Only until now it the habit of me getting annoyed at him when he's interacting with me came back.

1kdlorn,Was having a moment and came up with a list of a few of the sucky memories my dad has given me over the years,PrestigiousAbalone63,"The numbers in parentheses are the ages I was/ was around when it happened 

Things dad has done

Wouldn’t let me have legos because he didn’t want to have to put them together with me. When my mom when did buy them for me, he threw the box at her head. (6/7)

Made me hide in the closet, tempted to call 911. Called Grandmother (his mom) she told me to instead talk to my older sister. (8)

I used to hide under my mom’s bed when I heard him coming in and knew he was in a bad mood. (6/7)

Yelled at me when I threw up in the middle of the night and we had to wake him to help me. I was having panic attacks and he was yelling and refusing to come up because he was sleeping. (6/7)

Yelled at me about math homework and that I wasn’t understanding it his way and would yell at me and give up.(6-9)

During the first time trying to teach me ice skating, he got mad I was using the walker, threw it into the wall, and grabs my arm to prevent me from using it. Also threatened me to go home if I choose to use the walker (7)

Yelled when I cut my foot open by dropping a knife on it. I was worried about getting stitches but was relatively calm, just a bit anxious. He can up, looked at the cut and yelled “She’s gonna need fucking stitches!” And I immediately started hysterically crying. 
I didn’t end up needing stitches. (10)

Told me to go back to sleep on Christmas morning when I woke him up at the time we agreed on, 7:00am (5)

Has never truly said he loves me 

When I was potty training, he used to throw me on my bed when i wasn’t doing it right because I was a bit behind (2/3)

Used to punch the steering wheel or the dashboard of the car and I would get anxious that he would crash the car out of anger. (5/6-now)

1kdkr6r,I’m not sure my family would be my family if I could choose…,Conspiracy_Raven,"I’m just really tired of not feeling supported. It’s little things like cousins saying I’m not their real cousin because I’m their 2nd cousin….or family members taking offence at misconstrued words but not willing to listen when you try to explain. I have apologized for so many things that I shouldn’t have had to. I have tolerated so many controlling family members for so long. Any issues ( that a normal person would never remember or even care about) from the past are brought up and thrown in your face when you ask for help.  I’m supposed to attend everyone else’s life changing events but no one thinks mine are important. Graduation? Nope my grandparents attended my cousins not mine. College graduation….nope my cousin was getting married in a few days in the same  city (the city where all my family also lives) so nope no one came except my parents. My cousins got the expensive gifts I would get something cheap IF i got something. I’ve bought my cousins soooo many things I never get anything in return. 

I have fought battles for some of these people, protected some of these people, I have loved and cared for so many of them and I would still do and feel those things. But no recognition or reciprocation ever comes my way I feel taken advantage of. This is not something I can talk about with my family….anytime I try I’m “too emotional” “overreacting” “ so dramatic” etc. basically gaslit to the moon and back. 

Nothing outright horrible is said so no one outside of the family would believe what I’m saying, my family is good at appearances. No one outright hates me. It’s just treatment that feels like a scab being picked at and never allowed to heal. Yeah you can look past it and even forget it for a bit until your sweater catches it and tears it open again. 

Anyway I’m not sure what I was expecting to gain from this post but if you made it this far thanks for reading. 

I just don’t get it. I give and give and no one cares. I feel so invisible. My self esteem is so trashed and I know I just need to love myself but how in the world do I do that at this point. It’s really difficult to feel like you don’t belong but even more so when it’s your own family.

1kdk7fi,Literally Scared,No-Instruction_239,"My ex broke up with me at the end of last September.  He not only told me that he was breaking up with me; he told me that I need to move out of our house.  The worst part of all of it is/was that it's not only me, but my daughter as well.  
He broke up with me, told me that he doesn't love me anymore, and that we needed to find some other place to live.   
We were together nearly three years.  He promised me forever.  I truly believed it.  
He is not the father of my child, but he has a child of his own that my daughter and I now live without as well.  
At the end of last September, my daughter's life as well as my life changed forever.

A hurricane hit our area on 9/27.  I came home to find my belongings on our porch, where my ex had put them.  
We didn't have an argument.  We weren't on the outs.  We laughed together, ate together, slept together, lived together, etc.  My daughter's bedroom was exactly how she had always wanted it.  I had a safe home and \[thought\] I could find peace in my partner.

We had absolutely nowhere of our own to go, so we moved in with family in a neighboring town that was hit even harder by the hurricane.  
Luckily, my daughter was able to stay in the same school, and keep most of her hobbies/extra curricular stuff.  She kept her friends as well.

I on the other hand, am at a total loss.  I have no one.  I've pushed my friends away, and most of my family lives far away.  We live with two family members whom I love dearly, but have pushed them away as well.  
I'm depressed, anxious, and lost.  I suffer with (but am currently treated for) complex-PTSD and the depression and anxiety.   
Now that we are living with some family, I'm literally terrified of living alone.  Before my ex and I got together, I could live alone happily.  When I had my daughter and after her father left, she and I lived comfortably and happily too.  
I cannot bare the thought of finding a place of our own, and starting over.  It stops me in my tracks to even think about.

Has anyone else ever dealt with anything similar?  The family that we live with left for the weekend, and it's just my kiddo and I in the house.  It's storming right now, midnight, and I'm nearly shaking I'm so nervous.  Nervous from the storm, as well as just being the only adult here.  My sweet girl is asleep, so it's just my cat and I pretty much jumping from the thunder, and I'm wondering how on Earth I'm ever going to survive another forty years.",1,3,1746245177.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdk7fi/literally_scared/
1kdjwin,My family is falling apart and idk what to do,I_know_anymore_420,"(My condolences this is really long and ranty I’m so sorry in advance) I (16f) live with my family of 4; my brother (19m), father (50m) and mother (48f). Growing up I always thought we were that picture perfect family, my parents were highschool sweethearts who had the “perfect” child ratio, one boy and one girl who were what my mother would call “the perfect age apart” (4 years), and I thought my childhood was pretty good that my parents were happy and there was just nothing wrong that we in most of the sense were “perfect”. But now looking back especially after the last few years I’m starting to question if it was all just a facade. Long story short I’ve found in recent years my family is being held together by a piece of dental floss that’s been slowly breaking for who knows how long. As of the last maybe 3 years it’s like I’m living in an active war zone. My brother has let’s just say major anger issues and can often snap at something as little as him not getting the right fork for dinner, and a lot of his anger for a long time was directed towards me but as of recent years it’s only gotten worse and he’s fighting everyone. My brothers constantly having screaming matches with my mom and they often can go weeks without talking even though they live under the same roof. This is where the big problem comes in. my dad is a big believer of not getting involved and it’s leading to a lot of arguments between my mom and dad were she wants him to speak or do something about my brother and he’d prefer to ignore the situation entirely. This dynamic has basically caused my household to be a walking minefield. If my bother and my mom are fighting that means my mom and dad are going to start fighting and if my mom and dad are fighting then my mom and brother are going to start fighting. At this point I feel scared to breath the wrong way incase I set someone off. This past year it’s only gotten worse though. It’s like they can’t stand eachother, everyday there’s a new fight that has them all in a bad mood 24/7. I’ve taken to spending most of my time in my room, I eat dinner alone and often times only come out when it’s absolutely necessary and this is because they will often snap or take their anger out on me. I’ve been trying to keep our family together throughout all of this, I’ve organized family game nights that no one shows up for, I clear the table to have dinner together like we used to and it ends in a screaming match and door slamming, I make dinner for everyone and get told “they’ve already ate” and so on and so forth. This past week has probably been the worse though, my mom and brother are at it again and have been going back and forth for 5 days now and tonight my dad decided to get into it, however instead of trying to diffuse the situation he asked my mom “why she needed to be so difficult and have an attitude with everyone” as expected this didn’t go well and I came home to her downstairs away from everyone and having made the decision that if she’s the one who’s causing the problems then she’ll remove herself from the equation she also alluded to the idea that this will be permanent. She’s told me about her thinking about divorcing my dad for awhile now but they’ve been together almost 30 years and I personally don’t think she could they have a lot of history and for a long time I couldn’t see her walking away. But now, idk if I hold that belief anymore. I can’t help but feel like I’ve failed in some way, like i haven’t tried hard enough to keep my family happy and together. I understand logically it’s not my responsibility but I have this awful feeling in my chest. These past few years I’ve really started re-evaluating my childhood and it’s been tainted with the question of “what did I miss” I’m constantly wondering if my family was always this dysfunctional or if this is recent and the more I think about it the more I remember moments that I think I’ve blocked out to keep me sane. Idk I feel like I’m in an active war zone every time I wake up and I’m scared to set off the next chain reaction, a worry that has started plaguing me recently is what if I set it off and that’s what ends my family, it would be fitting really the one trying to keep everything from falling apart is the reason everything came smashing down. Im sorry this was so long and truly this isn’t even the half of it but i was having a really big moment where i needed someone to talk to and I don’t really have that irl. 
TL;DR:
I (16F) used to think my family was perfect, but in the past few years everything has unraveled—my brother (19M) has major anger issues and constantly fights with my mom, who in turn fights with my dad because he refuses to step in. The house feels like a war zone, and I’ve become isolated, trying (and failing) to keep the peace. My mom is now seriously considering leaving, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve somehow failed or that I might be the one to finally trigger the collapse.",3,2,1746244165.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdjwin/my_family_is_falling_apart_and_idk_what_to_do/

1kdjdd4,My family makes me feel incredibly conflicted,anonymou793584,"In all my years of life, I have been painted as the issue in my family. According to my mother, i've had behavioral issues and been emotionally unregulated since the age of 2. She put me in therapy at 3 and i was diagnosed with a behavioral disorder (it was later ruled out to be autism at 12yrs), and at 4 i was diagnosed with cancer and needed an organ transplant that had only heighten my mental health issues. I have been on anti depressants, and antipsychotic, since I was 7, and have been put through intensive and vast methods of therapy to ""fix me "". Later on in my adolescence, I was put in a mental facility because of my depression and suicidal thoughts, and to this day, I have had extreme depression and sadness due to my family. I have always been told that I am the issue in the house. My brother and sister function normally., my mother and father function, normally, and naturally it has made sense to me that because of my outburst and differing behavior from my family that I am the issue. I had extreme outbursts from 11-14 and while they have gotten better, I am pretty frequently arguing and yelling with my parents. Many of these outburst stem from how my parents treat me though. I feel like I am treated differently compared to my siblings, and it especially has increased over the past couple years. My mother especially treats me in a way that is hard to describe in words, but I'd like to compare it to living in the Truman show. It feels like one day she loves me more than anything in the world and the next day she wants me to disappear. My father is the same, but on a more extreme scale, he sometimes just gets incredibly angry with me and it genuinely is scary. often times I will get in arguments with my parents that end in my mom, dad brother, and sister going into a bedroom and locking the door and acting as if nothing happened, laughing and giggling and joking about how ""crazy"" I am. when I get in these arguments, my parents tell me really conflicting things. my mom, no matter her feelings about the situation will always remind me how much of a good person I am, but my dad likes to emphasize how much of a horrible person I am. 
The most conflicting thing about our issues is every time we end an argument, I always feel like I am not the issue. I will constantly gaslight myself that I'm overreacting and everything is fine, but I always come to the same conclusion that there is something wrong and it is not me. My mother had me insisted that i was tested for narcissism, borderline personality disorder, sociopathy, psychopathy, and any other mental disorder that falls under that umbrella and I never qualified for anything except ADHD, anxiety, depression, and autism. my question is, what the fuck is wrong with me and my family. I feel like I just don't fit with them. I don't think my family, specifically my mom and dad are bad people, but I think they are bad people to me. I don't understand why I get the treatment that I do. I know I have mental health issues, I know I have a lot of issues, but I don't think that's the answer as to why I have so many issues with my family. Can I really be the only person who's in the 'right'when I have four other people against me?

1kdjcon,I never wanted much. Just peace. But peace was never in the plan for me.,Common_Obligation982,"*(20M) | Fighting for my future and breaking the chains of my past*

I’m 20 years old, and I’ve been through hell, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that no matter how much the world tries to break me, I’m still standing. I’ve been through more than most people will in their entire lives by my age. Growing up, everything was a battle. I wasn’t the golden child in my family—I was the one always misunderstood, the one pushed aside, the one whose dreams were crushed by the very people who were supposed to support me. If you’ve ever felt like your family just doesn’t get you, doesn’t see your worth, or worse, actively works against you, then you’ll understand where I’m coming from.

Here’s the thing—I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. In fact, if anything, I was born into a toxic cycle. My family never believed in me, at least not in the way they should have. Instead, I was constantly met with disdain, harsh words, and a level of manipulation I didn’t fully understand until I was older. I thought that because they were my family, they would be there to guide me. But they weren’t guiding me—they were holding me back.

**The Toxicity of My Family: A Never-Ending Cycle**

There’s a quote that goes, “Family is everything.” But sometimes, family is the very thing that holds you down. And in my case, they were the chains that kept me from flying. It was always my sister who was the favorite—always praised, always pampered. She could do no wrong. Me? I was always the one who had to fight for approval. It didn’t matter how hard I worked, how much I pushed myself, or how much I tried to be the best version of myself—nothing was ever good enough.

When I was 14, I started working night shifts, all while trying to juggle school. I was trying to make money for something I was passionate about—gaming and esports. It was my dream. But that dream was shattered the moment my dad lost money to a scam. Instead of understanding that I was trying to build something for myself, my family took away my phone, my access to my games, and everything that kept me sane. They didn’t even try to understand why I needed it. Instead, they saw it as a luxury, something that should be taken away for the sake of “discipline.” Two years of this. Two years of my dreams being locked away.

I was 16 when I realized that everything I had worked for had been taken from me. I watched as my family destroyed what was left of my dreams. And for what? So they could “teach me a lesson”? The betrayal stung so much, but instead of giving in, I pushed back. But the damage was done. I stopped trusting them. And deep down, I knew they didn’t understand me, and they never would.

  
**The Toxic Sister and the Unfair Treatment**

Let me talk about my sister for a second. It’s not like I don’t care for her, but damn, the way she was used to manipulate everything in the house was something else. She’s 14 now, and honestly, it’s like I’ve watched this whole thing unfold for years, and nothing ever changes.

Here’s the deal—she was the *favorite*. Even when she wasn’t doing well in school (and let me tell you, she’s weak in studies), she’d still get more attention and forgiveness for everything she did. She would throw tantrums, act out, break things, say whatever the hell she wanted to say, and it was like nobody noticed. On the other hand, I could barely breathe without getting reprimanded or treated like I was some sort of failure. No matter how hard I worked, no matter what I did, I was always the one left carrying the weight of this invisible burden that nobody else had to deal with.

I remember every time I tried to stand up for myself, I’d be told I wasn’t ""respectful"" enough. Meanwhile, my sister? She would do whatever she wanted, and it was like everyone thought she was untouchable. I’d get blamed for things I didn’t do, my efforts were ignored, and I was the one punished for everything. And no one ever questioned it.

But there was a moment, one moment that changed everything for me.

It happened after one of those classic family blow-ups. My dad was once again talking about how I didn’t respect my sister, and how she was just like my mom, while I was somehow this different, “difficult” person. He looked at me and said, “Your sister is just like your mom, but you—you’re nothing like me.”

That line hit me like a slap in the face. For a second, I thought I’d lost it. But I didn’t let it go. I snapped back, “So if she’s like mom, does that mean I’m supposed to be like you? Am I just supposed to be the one who always gets blamed while she does whatever she wants? Is that how this works?”

There was a moment of silence, and I swear, it felt like time stopped. My dad didn’t have a response. He couldn’t. I was calling out the hypocrisy, the double standards, and for once, he had no comeback. I’d hit him with the truth, and he couldn’t handle it.

But that silence didn’t change anything. It didn’t stop the way my sister was treated like royalty while I was the one constantly undermined. It didn’t make my dad change his ways. And it certainly didn’t make my mom stand up for me. It was like everything I said, everything I felt, didn’t matter. I was just the “difficult one,” and she was always the “innocent, misunderstood” one, no matter what.

**The Betrayal of Relationships**

But it wasn’t just my family that hurt me—it was the people I trusted the most. The people I loved. I’ve had 3 girlfriends, and out of those, 1 were complete disasters. she cheated. she lied. They betrayed me. But I’m not here to talk about her. I’m here to talk about the two relationships that *could have* worked.

I wasn’t perfect. I had anger issues, and I wasn’t always the best partner. But when I loved, I loved *hard*. I gave everything I had. And I always thought that love was about loyalty and understanding. But the two relationships I thought would work out ended because of something simple—miscommunication. They didn’t understand me, and I didn’t understand them. They wanted me to be calm, to be someone I wasn’t. They wanted me to be perfect. But perfection doesn’t exist. What they didn’t get was that I wasn’t a villain. I was just a person who loved deeply and needed time to grow.

Even though they broke up with me, I understand now that it wasn’t about me being “too much.” It was about us not being able to communicate effectively. I’ll never forget what one of them said to me—*“I left him because of his anger. He would do anything for me, but if he was calm, maybe we could have fixed things.”* That hit hard because it made me realize that the only thing standing between me and the kind of love I wanted was my inability to understand and control my own emotions.

I don’t hold grudges against them. I don’t hate them. But I learned something important in those relationships: **if someone can’t love you for who you are—flaws, anger, and all—they weren’t meant for you.**



**The Isolation at School**

There was a time when I was just 11 years old, sitting in the middle of a classroom full of kids who didn’t care about what was going on in my world. The room was full of noise, chatter, and the clattering of pens and books, but I felt like I was in a completely different place—a silent island surrounded by people who were worlds apart from me.

And then, it happened.

It started slowly, little by little—at first, it was just a whisper in the halls. But one day, my parents decided to come to my school. They didn’t just come to visit, no. They came to *make a scene*—to remind me, and everyone else, of their version of ""discipline.""

They marched right into that classroom, and without a word to anyone, they told my teacher to move me—*separate me* from the one person who I thought might be the only friend I had. My desk mate—someone who, at that moment, felt like the only human bridge to normalcy—was torn away from me. And just like that, I was left sitting alone, in the middle of a room where the laughter of my classmates echoed off the walls, but none of it was aimed at me. It wasn’t just about physical distance. It was about the *message* they sent me that day.

They looked at me like I was a problem to be fixed, a nuisance to be ignored. They made sure I knew that I wasn’t allowed to be like the other kids, that I was different—not in a good way. The worst part? They didn't even need to say a word. Everyone knew. Everyone saw.

From that day on, I wasn’t just the kid who was different. I was the one who didn’t belong. The kid whose parents could show up anytime, unannounced, to make sure the world knew that I wasn’t good enough to be just another student. Every glance, every whisper in that classroom after that day felt like a dagger. I was isolated—not just from my friends but from my own hope.

And even though it may have seemed like a small thing to them, to me, it was a world-shattering moment. The thing about being isolated in school by the people who should have protected you is that it doesn’t just stop in the classroom. It follows you. It buries itself deep inside you and tells you every day that you’re not worth the effort, that you don’t deserve to belong.

That was my reality for a long time—being the outsider, the kid who never truly fit in. And yet, even through the humiliation and rejection, something deep inside me pushed back. Because when you're alone like that, you either let it break you, or you learn to *own* your space in the world.*ge: 20 | Fighting for my future and breaking the chains of my past*

I’m 20 years old, and I’ve been through hell, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that no matter how much the world tries to break me, I’m still standing. I’ve been through more than most people will in their entire lives by my age. Growing up, everything was a battle. I wasn’t the golden child in my family—I was the one always misunderstood, the one pushed aside, the one whose dreams were crushed by the very people who were supposed to support me. If you’ve ever felt like your family just doesn’t get you, doesn’t see your worth, or worse, actively works against you, then you’ll understand where I’m coming from.

Here’s the thing—I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. In fact, if anything, I was born into a toxic cycle. My family never believed in me, at least not in the way they should have. Instead, I was constantly met with disdain, harsh words, and a level of manipulation I didn’t fully understand until I was older. I thought that because they were my family, they would be there to guide me. But they weren’t guiding me—they were holding me back.'

**Expected to Be Perfect. Allowed To be Nothing:**

I wasn’t allowed to make mistakes. Every time I failed, it was like I was being punished. My dad, instead of being supportive, acted like I owed him something—like I was the one who was responsible for all the mistakes he made. They never tried to help me achieve my goals. They tried to mold me into what they wanted me to be, but never once asked me what *I* wanted. It was always about what was easiest for them. What worked for them.

When I was trying to break into the gaming world, they never supported me. It didn’t matter that I was working night shifts or doing everything I could to make a name for myself. They only saw the end result—the games, the hours I spent playing, and the passion I had for esports. They didn’t see the work behind it. Instead, they saw an “addiction,” something that was taking me away from what they thought I *should* be doing. I wasn’t allowed to make a single decision without being scrutinized. It didn’t matter if it was about my future, my friends, or my passions. I was always the one who was wrong.

And yet, despite all of this, I still tried to make things work. I worked even harder. I tried harder to prove myself, to show them that I could be the person they wanted me to be. But it was never enough. I wasn’t allowed to make mistakes, and when I did, they would hold it over my head like some kind of weapon.

**Then came the final punch in the gut.**

After I graduated with a [B.Com](http://B.Com) at the age of 19—way ahead of many—I was promised something. A chance to chase my dream: animation. I held on to that promise like a child gripping the last thread of hope. I had waited two years for that moment, grinding in silence, dreaming in color. And then, just like that, on a random night... it was gone.

I was learning digital art, building my skills, and finally feeling like I was on the path I had always dreamed of. But then, my father called me. He told me to talk with my sister—see how I was doing, check in with her. So I did.

A call. From someone I never expected to break me—my big cousin sister. The one I used to look up to. The one I used to say was like the big sister I never had. I loved her. Respected her. Trusted her.

But that night, she shattered me.

""Listen,"" she said, casually, like it was just another conversation. ""Animation? It’s good, but compared to IT companies... it’s not stable. It’s a waste of time. Why not learn coding? There’s a future in that. You’ll get a job. It’s better.""

Better for who, though?

I paused. I was confused at first. Then angry. Then hollow. Before I spoke, I was already feeling the weight of the conversation that had been brewing inside me.

""I waited two damn years to do this one thing,"" I whispered, trying to stay calm, trying to hold myself together. ""I did everything they asked. I passed every test. I gave up everything I loved. I kept my head down and waited. And now… just like that? It’s gone?""

She sighed, as if I was overreacting. ""You’re just emotional right now. Be practical. This is what’s good for you.""

Good for me? No one even asked what I wanted. Not once. Not even her.

And then came the words that hit hardest of all.

""Think about your family,"" she said. ""Look how poor they are. You’re the one who should look out for them. You need to think about the future.""

It wasn’t about whether coding was bad. It was about being told again that my dreams didn’t matter. That my choices were disposable. That I was a puppet—only allowed to move the way they wanted.

I broke down after that call. Not with rage. But with heartbreak. It hurt more coming from her. She was supposed to be different. But she chose their side. She tried to convince me like I was stupid. Like I didn’t know what I was capable of. Like my passion was just a phase.

But the worst part? It wasn’t just that call. It was the broken promises. For years, they promised me a laptop—an actual laptop—so I could study animation, create, and bring my vision to life. They knew how much it meant to me. Ever since I was a child, I had a love for drawing. That passion never left me. Even in college, I stood out. I received a gold medal and multiple certificates for my artistic talent. My professors supported me. My teachers knew my potential. Yet, when the time came to support me, they didn’t.

That night, I sat alone, staring at nothing, eyes burning, soul numb. And it hit me:

No one in this family wanted me to live my life. They just wanted me to live theirs.

**Three Months Later**

It had been three months since that call, since the night my dreams were shattered by the cold reality of my family's expectations. A lot had happened in that time, and yet, nothing had changed. I was still stuck in the same rut. But now, the anger inside me wasn’t so fresh. It had turned into something darker. Resentment. And I had learned something I wasn’t ready to face: I hated everything I had to learn, everything I had done for them.

I remember that day clearly—the day I finally got the laptop. The one they promised me would be for animation, for my art. I had dreamed about it for so long, picturing the screen lighting up with possibilities, my creative mind coming to life. But no. When the laptop finally arrived, it wasn’t for animation. It was for coding.

And I hated it.

I hated how I had to pretend to care about something I had no passion for, just to please them. Coding wasn’t me. It wasn’t what I dreamed of. But they didn’t care. They didn’t ask. They just handed it to me like a consolation prize for all the times I had to put aside my desires for theirs. The truth hit me harder than anything: they didn’t care about my dreams. They didn’t care about me.

The promise of animation seemed like a joke now. A lie. I didn’t get the laptop for animation. I got it to follow their path, to do something that *they* thought was better for me. To follow their ideal of stability.

I spent countless nights sitting in front of that laptop, staring at lines of code I could barely understand, feeling my soul drain with each keystroke. The passion I once had for art, for animation, was slipping through my fingers like sand. Every time I tried to draw, every time I tried to focus on what I truly wanted to do, the weight of their expectations bore down on me. It was suffocating.

At first, I tried to make it work. I pushed myself, tried to convince myself that maybe coding wasn’t so bad. Maybe I could just learn it, get the job, and maybe, just maybe, I’d be able to live out my dream of animation once I had the stability they kept talking about. But the more I tried, the more hollow I felt. Coding wasn’t my dream. Animation was. And I hated myself for pretending to be someone I wasn’t, for learning something I didn’t care about, all for the sake of family.

Three months had passed, and I was more lost than ever. I kept thinking about all the times I sacrificed for them—the nights I stayed up studying things I didn’t want to learn, the hours spent doing what they thought was best for me. I wanted to scream. I wanted to break free. But every time I tried, the fear of disappointing them held me back.

**A Family Crisis You’d Never Expect**

So here's the situation that still haunts me—this whole 9k fiasco that ended up being more of a nightmare than it should have ever been. It’s not just about money—it’s about how everything gets twisted, manipulated, and how I’m left holding the blame for things that aren't even my fault.

I was about 19 years old at the time, still trying to make sense of everything going on in my life. I was away at a distant village, attending a birthday party I didn’t even want to go to. It was a place I didn’t care about, with relatives I barely knew, but I went because family, right? The whole 9-hour train ride to get there was a drag, but I made the trip. I was talking with some distant relatives I hadn’t seen since before Corona hit.

That’s when it happened. My phone buzzed, and I saw my mom calling. I thought it was a routine check-in, but no—this was the start of something I couldn’t have expected. She sounded off, panicking even, and she goes, ""Where did you put the 9k? I need to know right now.""

At first, I thought maybe something went wrong, and the money had been misplaced. But then I realized what she was talking about: the 9k from the 24k total amount that had been used to pay off some family debt.

Here’s the twist—I didn’t even touch the damn 9k. It was money that had been repaid at the gold debt office after we'd settled that issue. My mom had forgotten that we had paid that debt off and received the gold back. Yet, now I was being dragged into this mess as if I had stolen the 9k or wasted it on gambling.

It gets worse.

While I’m trying to understand what the hell she’s talking about, my grandma, who was with me at the time, takes the phone. She talks with my mom for a minute, and that’s when the story starts to get out of control.

Now, as the minutes tick by, I’m still sitting there at the party, trying to keep my cool and handle whatever chaos is happening on the other side of the phone. Suddenly, my mom says—out of nowhere—""I know he used that 9k for games or gambling, didn’t he? He probably lost it all already.""

I was stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I had never used that money for anything other than what we agreed on. It was all for the debt. But here she was, accusing me of gambling it away, as if I had no sense of responsibility or self-control.

She didn’t even stop to think about the fact that she had given me that money to handle in the first place. The money she had entrusted me with while my dad was off doing whatever he was doing—drinking, being reckless, not paying attention to the family. She told me to handle that 24k, knowing that I was the one who had to deal with all of it while everything else in our family was falling apart.

But that didn’t matter, right? No, in her mind, I was the one who screwed up. I was the one who used that 9k to waste on something as stupid as games or gambling. And when my grandma handed the phone back to me, my mom wasn’t backing down. The damage was already done.

I asked her again, ""Mom, why are you doing this? I didn’t touch that money. It was already repaid at the gold office. We got the gold back. It’s not what you're saying.""

But instead of listening, she just kept going. She kept pushing the same narrative that I was a screw-up, that I couldn’t handle money, that I was just like every other disappointment. It was like she didn’t even care about the truth anymore, only about blaming me for something I didn’t do.

And here’s where it really hit me. I had been the one trying to keep the family afloat, trying to manage everything the best I could, while dealing with their drama and poor decisions. But all I ever got was accusations, blame, and guilt.

No one ever took a step back to realize how much I was handling. No one cared to acknowledge that I was trying to make things work. Instead, they just kept dumping more on me, hoping I’d fail so they could say, “See? We were right all along.”

And in the end, I was just left standing there, trying to process everything. I was supposed to be the one who held it all together, but I was constantly being torn down, accused of things I didn’t do, blamed for failures I had no part in. It’s like they could never see me for what I was doing or how hard I was trying.

**The Next Day:**

The following day was just as messed up as the day before. I was still feeling the weight of everything that had gone down with the 9k, and to be honest, I just wanted to forget the whole thing. But the chaos wasn’t over.

Out of nowhere, my grandma calls again. I knew something was up, but I didn’t expect it to be this bad. She was on the phone with my uncle—my mom’s big brother—and started explaining the whole situation to him. Apparently, grandma knew the truth from the start, and she was defending me, saying I hadn’t done anything wrong. She even told my uncle that I was innocent, that I didn’t touch the money. I couldn’t help but feel a tiny sense of relief hearing that someone in the family was standing up for me, but at the same time, it felt like too little, too late.

My uncle, always the more reasonable one in the family, backed me up without hesitation. He knew my character, and he’d seen me growing up. From the moment I was a kid, he knew I wasn’t the type to mess up like this. He defended me like a lion, telling grandma that he was 100% sure I hadn’t touched the money or used it for gambling or games. He had always seen me as the responsible one, even when my own parents didn't.

But of course, when the truth finally came to light, my mom wasn’t having any of it. She called me soon after, and her tone was anything but apologetic. “Yeah, we paid the debt,” she said, almost like it was a confession. “But I’m still confused why I didn’t remember. If your uncle had said something first, why wouldn’t I remember?”

I was stunned. There she was, still trying to twist things, still trying to make it seem like I was the one who had done something wrong. She couldn't even bring herself to admit her mistake without trying to justify it. It was infuriating.

The weight of everything finally hit me in that moment. Here I was, fighting to keep everything together, doing my best to manage the responsibilities the family placed on me, and yet it felt like I was never going to get out of the shadows of their accusations. I had become so used to this toxic environment that it was starting to feel like I would never escape. I wasn’t even allowed to have a single win without it being undermined, twisted, or dismissed.

And honestly? It broke me.

I remember walking away from the phone call, tears filling my eyes, my chest heavy with emotions I couldn’t even process. The exhaustion of constantly fighting to prove myself. The betrayal. The guilt. The hopelessness. I hated my life. I hated the family I had been born into. I hated feeling like nothing I did was ever good enough.

But there was more to it than just anger. There was a sense of deep sadness, a hollow ache in my chest that only came from trying so hard and still being treated like the villain. My mom had no idea how much damage she’d caused by blaming me for something that wasn’t my fault. And my dad? He was nowhere to be found, probably drunk somewhere, oblivious to the chaos that had unfolded in his absence.

I was left in a space of deep isolation, a place where I couldn’t even trust the people I’d once called family. No one understood me. No one saw me for what I truly was—a person who had been carrying too much weight for too long. And the worst part? They didn’t even care enough to make things right.

I spent the rest of that day alone, battling with myself. My mind was spinning with thoughts of everything I had lost, everything I had sacrificed. But there was also a flicker of something else—something that refused to die, something that kept pushing me forward.

That something was me.

Even though I hated the situation, even though I wanted to give up on everything, there was still a part of me that couldn’t quit. I was tired, broken, misunderstood—but I wasn’t done. I knew I had to keep moving forward, even if it meant facing this nightmare alone.

So yeah, my family didn’t save me. They couldn’t. The only person who could get me out of this hole, the only one who would be there to help me rise above it all, was me. I knew that. And no matter how much I wanted to give in, to let the guilt and shame consume me, there was a fire inside that wouldn’t let me quit.

I was the only one who truly understood what I was capable of. And that’s why, even though my family didn’t get it, even though they blamed me and twisted the truth, I kept pushing forward. Because in the end, the only person whose opinion mattered was mine.

And with that, I knew I would rise above it all. I wouldn’t let their mistakes, their misunderstandings, or their toxic ways define me. I would build myself back up, and maybe—just maybe—I’d find peace in knowing that I was stronger than any of them ever realized.

  
**The Spark That Wasn’t Meant to Burn**

After all the silence, all the pain, something inside me began to stir again.

It wasn’t animation—at least, not yet. But it was something. I started to get curious about AI and data science. Maybe it was the logic. Maybe it was the idea of building something intelligent. Maybe I just wanted to find meaning in this mess I had been forced into. But this time, I was the one who chose it. Not them.

I didn’t jump into it blindly. I took two months off before touching it. Two months where I felt… half-baked. Incomplete. I had learned Python, sure, but just enough to know how far I still had to go. I wasn’t ready back then. My mind was still recovering from everything I lost. From everything they crushed. But when I *was* ready, I thought: maybe if I studied this on my own terms, it’d be different.

So I did the one thing they always asked for. I *asked* them.

I told them, “I want to study. Help me. I need some money to enroll in the course.”

At first? They agreed. They said, “Yeah, sure.”

And for a brief moment—I believed them.

But life with them always has a twist, right?

A few days later, they hit me with it:  
**“Don’t you have money from your part-time job? Pay from that. We don’t have money now.”**

I froze.

The money they were talking about? That was *my* money. The little I had scraped together working nights, saving every rupee with one dream in mind: to finally buy my animation tools. A pen tablet. Better RAM. Maybe a second screen someday. They knew that. They *knew*. They told me themselves: “We’ll help you buy your animation gear.” Another promise.

Another lie.

And now? That savings, that tiny island of hope I’d built in secret—was being dragged away too.

They didn’t care that I’d been through hell and still tried. They didn’t care that this wasn’t just “some course” for me. That I was trying to rise from the wreck they left me in.

I wasn’t asking for luxuries. I wasn’t wasting their money on games or gadgets. I was fighting for a chance. For growth. For independence. And even that was too much for them.

They turned my dreams into a currency they never planned to pay.

**The Fight for Success**

At 16, when my dreams of gaming and esports were destroyed, I had to pick up the pieces of my shattered future. I tried to go back to school, tried to act like everything was fine, but it wasn’t. My family didn’t get it. They didn’t see that my drive, my passion, was what kept me alive. Without it, I felt like I was dying on the inside.

But I never gave up. I worked harder. I started learning about data science, AI, and improving my FPS skills. In just four months, I went from being a complete beginner to understanding the ins and outs of the game. I’ve always had this fire inside me that refuses to die. Sure, I’m still learning, and I’m not perfect. But I’m moving forward.

I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. My biggest vice is masturbation, and even then, I don’t let it control me and eventually i dropped that habit. I stay focused. I push myself. But more than anything, I keep my eyes on the prize: building something for myself. Something that will eventually make everything worth it.

**The Truth About Who I Am**

I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve had my fair share of downfalls. But here’s the thing—I’m still fighting. I’m still pushing forward. I’m not letting my past define me. I’m not letting anyone dictate who I am or who I will become.

If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt like life is working against you, like you’ve been stuck in a cycle of disappointment and heartache, know this: You’re not alone. And you’re not weak. You’re stronger than you realize. You just have to keep going. You just have to keep fighting.

Because in the end, **you are the one who writes your story.** And no matter how many times life knocks you down, you get back up. Every. Single. Time.

**The Final Decision: Between Love and Escape**

So here I am now—20 years old, standing at the edge of a cliff that’s more emotional than physical. After everything I’ve been through, every lie tossed at me, every blame thrown, every time I stood alone while they all pointed fingers... I’ve hit a wall. A point where I’m finally asking:

**What now?**

On one hand, there's this fire in me. This voice screaming, *“Run. Cut the cord. Burn the bridge. You don’t owe them anything.”* Just vanish. Build a life so far from this mess, they'll need a telescope to even guess what I became. Fly high, disappear, ghost the bloodline like I was never born into it. Start fresh, where I don’t carry the burden of their mistakes, where I’m not the emotional punching bag. Live not as their son, but as my own creation. My own man.

But on the other hand… they’re my parents.

Yeah, they hurt me. They broke things in me that I’m still trying to fix. They turned love into guilt and trust into chains. But I also remember that look in their eyes—the one that says *they’re lost too.* That they're drowning in their own wounds, repeating the same broken cycles because no one ever showed them another way.

I remember that I once gave them hope. I was the one who promised, “I’ll make your wishes come true.” That’s the messed-up part. I still want to. Deep inside, there’s a piece of me that wants to give them the life they never had. I want to become someone so great that even my father, drunk and defeated, will one day sit down and say, *“That’s my son.”*

And my mom... as toxic as her words get, I know she’s been broken for years. I know she’s just passing on the pain she never got to heal from. I get it. I do. But just because I understand them doesn’t mean I should have to suffer for them.

I’m stuck between being the **son who saves them** and the **man who saves himself.**

It hurts. Every day. Because whichever road I choose, I lose something.

If I stay and fulfill their dreams, I might never have the chance to chase my own. I’ll be a puppet in their tragedy, slowly turning into someone I swore I’d never be.

If I leave… I might live with the guilt that I abandoned the very people who gave me life. That I let them crumble when they had no one else. That I became the villain in a story where all I ever wanted was to be the hero.

and 

Right now I’m torn between cutting ties and staying for their sake. What do you think is the right thing to do? or am I overreacting, or does this hurt the way I think it does?  

So what do I want?

Peace. Real peace. A life where love isn’t a weapon, where I’m not questioned every time I speak truth, where I can laugh without wondering who’s going to twist it tomorrow. I want to wake up without a weight in my chest. I want to live—not just survive.

I want someone to say, *“You don’t have to fight today, it’s okay to rest. I’ve got you.”*

I want a home where I’m not walking on eggshells, where I’m not blamed for ghosts I never summoned. I want a family one day, one I build from scratch, where my kids never have to cry alone like I did.

And until then? I want space. Time. Healing.

Not revenge. Not hatred. Just... a clean break. A fresh start. Even if it means being misunderstood forever. Even if they call me ungrateful or heartless.

Because I’m not heartless.

That’s the real curse.

I care too damn much.

And maybe that’s why I need to go.

Not to run—but to finally breathe.  \~peace off your friendly spidy

1kdhwwk,I feel like my mom is Infantalizing me and I don't know what to do,Mean_Release_143,"I am 22 years old, and I am currently in my last year of college, and I am also autistic, and I feel like my mom doesn't trust me to be independant.



For example, I am 22 years old and I still don't even have a driver's license, and a few months ago I finaly got my permit. When I was a teenager in high school I would try and get my mom to let me learn how to drive but she wouldn't let me or take me to driver's ed, and wouldn't want to have any discussion about me learning how to drive. The reason why is because I am autisitc, and she thinks that I would have a hard time paying attention. This is a common thing in autistic people, but, at the same time there are plently of autsitic people or other people with conditions like ADHD who can drive perfectly fine. Her and I have aruged about this, and I've brought this point up to her and she's mentioned that she knows this.  I think it's unfair of her to just shoot down any possibility of me learning how to drive in the past when she wouldn't even at least give me a chance to see if I could actually handle driving or not. I also don't have any extended family who could help me since, they don't live in the same state and my father is out of the picture. She was basically the only person who could have helped learn how to drive during this time.



In the past few years whenever I have mentioned to her learning how to drive, she alsways uses some excuse to get out of the discussion. She'll say things like ""we're trying to pay for college right now,"" or ""You're a not a teenager, you should learn how to pay for things on your own, I want to see you get a job first."" I have a job when I am on break from college, but it's a job that is walking distance from where I live. I feel like it's going to be a lot harder for me to get a job at other places if I don't drive. Sometimes uses my autism as an excuse. However, if I don't drive than I can't take driving lessons, so I would need somebody to take me. She gets annoyed when I would ask her about drivers ed over the past couple of years, but, I feel like she doesn't have the right to be annoyed with me about this, because I feel like if she had just let me learn how to drive in high school like I was supposed to, than I wouldn't be bringing it up to her now. So if she gets annoyed with me about this, than I feel like that's her fault, and it's unfair for her to get annoyed with me about asking how to learn how to drive. It also bothers me how my mom is telling me how I need to be more independant, but, how does she expect me to be independent if she doesn't let me do things that are going to actually allow me be independant?



Over the couple of years my mom got a new boyriend who I really get a long with, and he agrees with me that I need to learn how to drive, and so does my older brother. After a while of convincing her, a few months ago I finally got my permit for driving, and she didn't even seem happy about it when I passed the test. She looked more concerned than anything, which really bothered me. Later when, we talked about me taking drivers ed courses to get my license during the summer, she makes ""jokes"" like, ""When you drive, we're probabaly going to have to have helmets on."" This comment really bothered me, because how does she know, that I would be a bad driver, if she's never given me a chance to drive. She is saying this too because I am autistic.



I also feel like my mom is criticizing me about everything that I do, it could be anything from the way my hair looks, to the way I am dressed, to something I decide to buy for myself. Over the past six months i've lost some weight too, because i've been trying to get more serious about the gym and my diet. Since I've lost weight she has been calling me ""skinny boy"" to tease me, but I hate it when she calls me that. What really stuck out to me however, was that one time she was on the phone with somebody, and she said that she doesn't want me to lose anymore weight. I haven't lost an amount of weight that would even be considered concerning. I feel fine and healthy, and I've actaully been in the best shape that I've been in in a long time.  I feel like she is undermining any sort of independant choice that I make for myself.



Recently I made some irresponsible financial decisions regarding a short film that I want to make (I am a film major) and wasn't happy with me. I don't work when I am at college and work when I am on my winter and summer break, and she sends me money if I ever need it. The thing is that she insists that I shouldn't work when I am in college (I live on campus) because she thinks that school should be my main priority. When I made the financial decisions for my short film, she told me that ""I am acting like I am an adolescence, and not like a responsible adult."" I agree with her to some extent, that I still feel like a teenager, but, I feel like my mom hasn't really given a lot of guidance on how to be an adult. I am concerned for my future because, I don't know anything about taxes, what it's going to take to get my own place, etc. because I feel like I don't know anything about being an adult. 



When we've talked about living on my own, she suggested building a guest house for me or something (which I doubt will happen), but I feel like I want my own place. I feel like she is only thinking about what she thinks is ""best"" for me, and not taking my feelings into account. I basically feel like my mom doens't trust me to be independant because I have autism. 



TL;DR: I have autism and I feel like my mom uses this as a reason to infintalize me. I need advice on what to do. I've been feeling this way for a long time. ",2,2,1746237457.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdhwwk/i_feel_like_my_mom_is_infantalizing_me_and_i_dont/
1kdhiea,Living with 88 yr old grandmother,Valuable-One-4341,"Hi reddit world. First time poster here. My husband, children, and I have moved in with my 88 year old grandmother because she no longer is able to maintain the upkeep of the home. The home is being left to us when she passes away but that is not the point of this post. Before we could move ourselves in we had to take care of a mold issue, mouse infestation, and slight hoarding. My grandmother is from the Philippines and we've noticed as she gets older she is going back to many of the cultural norms from in the Philippines but we cannot for the life of us figure out why/how she is able to do this one thing.... She constantly is leaving uncooked and/or cooked meat out for days. It smells awful. Currently she made sardines a few days ago and they're still sitting in the pan on the stove. She also put the fish blood in jars (with no lids) and told me not to dispose of them because she's going to use it as fertilizer for plants. The house smells since these things have been left out. She is very capable of taking care of these things and is a very strong willed woman. I've learned I cannot clean up after her without being met with hostility. She does not recognize how awful and disgusting it is and when people walk into the home that's the first thing they are seeing/smelling. 

How do I even approach this with her? My husband says I need to just tell her she cannot be cooking like this and it's affecting the children (it's not. They haven't even said anything about it and we do not allow them to eat her cooking ever). His stance is basically tell her she no longer can do the things she is accustomed to. I want to respect her cultural norms, but also would love a clean and sanitary kitchen. 

Side note...she also has a habit of cooking food, leaving it in the pots/pans/dishes, and then placing in the garage somewhere where it will sit for months .... 

Living with family is hard.

1kdgvt4,I cannot stand my brother and i do not know how to bring this to my family,ArabMclovin19,"Im in a family of 3 siblings and a married couple obviously, due to work reasons my dad is not always living with us. But besides that were a functional family, and me and my brothers are in the early puberty, to late teenage years (wont be going into more detail as to not dox myself)

My youngest brother is a pain in the ass, so me and to my parents and to my other brother. He is a struggle in academics and goes thru plenty of tutoring yet his grades are horrible, he is constantly getting into detention at school, hes  a big attention seeker to his friends, and is somewhat a bully. At home he leaves a meds in whatever place he can and has to mark his presence by being the most unorganized human ever(plates and tissue paper and day old food everywhere). He rage quits like his life depends on the gamed he play, breaking multiple controllers and causing great damage to whatever devices he uses out of anger and not carelessness or a simple accident. His hygiene is horrible and getting him to shower is like asking for a million bucks. 

I just cant stand him because every interaction i have with him is negative, and the few times i interact with him im just too done with him.

Now i do undrthat him being a kid going thru puberty hes going thru things and more importantly, i cent blame him as much as i can blame my mom (dad isnt living with us so not much he can do). My mom allows this by constantly allowing all this tomfoolery and letting everything slide, by simply giving him a pat on the hand without any actual consequences to his actions.

Ive had hella fights with my mom over my brother because there were so many things i felt my mom was doing wrong but eventually chose to just not interfere because it was affecting my mental health and at the end of the day hes not my child. But even after not interfering it is still affecting me.",1,2,1746234119.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdgvt4/i_cannot_stand_my_brother_and_i_do_not_know_how/
1kdgfbq,Am I in the wrong for not wanting to do the Sunday washing up every week?,therealsheldon79,"So a couple things to start of with: I have a brother in his 20's who lives at home but never does any chores (my mum still does his laundry and everything), I don't live at home anymore but when I did I did 80% of the chores in the house and my mum also has a partner who lives there. 

  
My mum does have some health issues and does most of the cooking so I completely understand why she shouldn't have to do the washing up on Sundays (we have a big roast dinner), and currently her partner is ill so for this week I wouldn't mind helping.

  
However she gets angry if I don't come on Sundays for the sole reason that I won't be there to wash up and she knows my brother absolutely won't do it. 

I've thought about trying to discuss this with her, but we have a difficult relationship and my brother is the favorite child (said by my mum). I would like a system where he either helps me with the large amount of washing or we alternate weeks. I'm seriously considering not going anymore because I assumed my brother would step up to help more when I left but that definitely hasn't happened. 

I still go round to help with all sorts, so it's not just about the washing up, but it is feeling like nothing has changed. 

I'm sorry if this seems really petty, I just want to know if I'm overreacting. Thanks :)",1,1,1746232718.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kdgfbq/am_i_in_the_wrong_for_not_wanting_to_do_the/

1kda4se,Is it normal I am discouraged and worried about my dad?,Sea_Sapphire_2168,"Hello Reddit,

So, I(24F), currently living with the parents; studying and recently got a job (Im ashamed at my age), have a question.

My father travelled a couple days ago, and I knew about it only around a week before (I say this because I have a SAHM mom (with emotional issues, elder and else) and a severe autistic brother. While my mom should be able to handle herself and my brother, Im worried about them at a certain point). So, coordination is key, and with me starting a new job/new semester this kinda took me by surprise. But I know my dad has all the rights to leave for a vacation and such.

The thing is, he's travelling to resolve legal issues, literally booked his hotel the night before travelling for 10 days, I had to help him organize a couple stuff, booked his flight 6 days prior, etc.

Am I wrong about feeling discouraged/disappointed on him? My father has always been like this, disorganized, unpredictable (yeah, shitty dad) but its my dad and helped me troughout my depressive times and while job seeking in the last years. But, aa a daughter, is it normal for me to feel a bit disappointed? Or are my boundaries wrongly set? How would you feel if your father did this?",2,13,1746215568.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kda4se/is_it_normal_i_am_discouraged_and_worried_about/

Each year she would say how tired she is of spain and that she doesn't want to spend any more time there, but she still ended up staying there (because of my step dads work). 
They have a child together (9M) and i love him a lot because he's my brother but at the same time i am so jealous of him because he is growing with both parents in a happy marriage while im stuck with my grandma and my older brother (19M).

1kd8y44,It’s hard having no village. I’m a new mom,StatGoddess,"
First baby and he’s about 8 weeks. My husband is great. Very helpful and supportive. I’m struggling with PPD ( have been seen by a mental health professional). Both our parents live in our city but they’re not really “available” if you know what I mean. My parents have issues with themselves. There’s a lot of abuse there. And sadness. My dad is abusive  to my mom and she stays around.  They are also dealing with a separate issue with one of my siblings. I often feel like they dump on me, especially my mother. About her issues with my father, the issues with my sibling, etc. she’s not really emotionally available to help me occasionally. Not with tasks around my home or to watch my son for a few hours. When she’s over, she seems distracted , rattled, and unable to be attentive. My father doesn’t even come over. I don’t go to their house because I don’t want my son around potential abusive convos or fights. Plus the sadness and pain lingers like a cloud. My mother asks how I am but I give superficial answers cuz I know she doesn’t have the capacity to actually know that I’m struggling. I actually feel like I’m her village: hearing her out, offering advice/support, etc. I’m obviously worried about the issue with my sibling which I won’t go into detail. But it’s pretty serious and I wish I could snap my fingers and make it better. I’m also struggling with my body image. Struggling to lose more weight and just generally unhappy with how I look. 

My in laws are very hands off and seem not to take an interest very much. They are dealing with financial hardship and my MIL is often annoyed that my FIL drinks so much and is so negative about life in general. Mainly because of his job, lack of sufficient income. The few times she’s over, she makes rude comments about my choice to combo feed and often criticizes really small things about my home, what’s in my fridge, etc. she’s not exactly supportive or encouraging. Kinda makes me feel like I should be doing a better job at being a mother. 

I don’t know why I wrote this. Probs to vent and just say it’s hard when you don’t have anyone outside your partner to rely on- emotionally or physically. Because even my husband needs breaks too, you know? ",3,5,1746212532.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kd8y44/its_hard_having_no_village_im_a_new_mom/

They have an immature, toxic relationship with most if not all of the negativity coming from his end. He does not respect her, speaks badly about her, and is downright disrespectful behind her back and even to her face. He acts like he’s gods gift to her. I want to disclose some information to help paint the picture of what’s going on, not as an excuse for his shitty behavior but simply for context: we were raised by a single mom with no money. There was a lot of addicts in our family as well so we did not have good male role models. He was/is babied a lot by members of our family that he lives with. Here’s the straw that broke the camels back: This past weekend I invited my brother and his gf over for drinks. Her mom has recently passed away from cancer so I thought it’d be nice to help her get her mind off things. One thing leads to another and my brother is calling her a f****** b****, calling her fat, and basically berating her for most of the night. I told him to be respectful to her and stop telling her bad things as the vibe was getting awkward. He became hostile and began deflecting. I’m disgusted, especially considering the traumatic event she is going through. I don’t even know where to go from here because the thought of being around him is repulsive. It’s a shitty situation because he’s my brother and we’ve been through a lot but I just don’t want anything to do with this vile side of him.

1kd3zht,"Question About Attending a Family Member's Frequent Marriages, from an Example Taken from Diary of a Wimpy Kid",squirrelzone8564,"TL;DR: What would you do if you were asked to attend a family member's frequent remarriage weddings?

So here's some background: In Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth, Greg Heffley and his dad Frank's side of the family attend his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. (Gary is Frank's brother.) Gary's marriages don't last long because Gary hasn't matured over the years: he isn't that bright, doesn't want to settle down, acts like a child, and has little money. Indeed, when Gary appears in The Third Wheel, set a few months later, he is single again. Gary's been married so many times that Greg's mother Susan uses photos of Greg and Rodrick from each wedding to act as growth charts. The first wedding shows Greg and Rodrick to be under 12 years old. The second shows them a little older and Manny as a baby. The third shows Greg and Rodrick as teens and Manny as a toddler.

Greg doesn't want to attend the wedding because one of his classmates is having a party the same weekend. He promises to attend Gary's fifth wedding next time, but Susan makes him go to the fourth wedding anyway. (I got the feeling her husband Frank, Rodrick, and Manny don't want to attend either.) She feels it's important to support family. Throughout the series, Susan tends to be family centric, and she often makes ridiculous demands on her family using the arguments of ""family bonding time"" or ""family members must support each other."" She uses these in The Third Wheel to pressure Frank to allow Gary to move in temporarily until Gary can find a job.

Obviously, this is a fictional example, in a children's book series notorious for funny outrageous situations. But families in real life can have all sorts of ridiculous demands, especially when it comes to weddings. If you had a family member whose marriages didn't last long because of personal flaws and they kept remarrying, what would you do? What would you do if other family members pressured you to attend the one family member's numerous weddings?",1,1,1746200152.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kd3zht/question_about_attending_a_family_members/

When I was 6-7 my dad fell in love with my then best friends mom while he still is married and has a relationship with my mom, wich I found out a few years ago and I got so disgusted. 

Five years ago my dad accidentally sent me a message that said, “ But you were very beautiful on Thursday and your perfume was like a wonderful summer meadow, you smelled so wonderful! I want to wish you a wonderful Midsummer weekend, and a nice continuation of the summer. Take care of yourself, and have a great time!” While he still is married and has a relationship with my mom.
I got confused and didn’t understand much except I got confused. 

A few years ago he also told me he thinks it’s okay to cheat in a relationship if the relationship is bad or unhealthy, beacuse that’s what my moms and his relationship is.
I said I didn’t agree and we just had arguments until I left,  I might have said that it’s disgusting. 
Also, one time my old best friend (who’s mom my dad had romantic feelings for ) asked me if I could ask my dad to loan her a car ride to pick up something but I said no because my dad did have feeling for her and I got disgusted obv of the thought of them meeting agin and tearing down my whole world and destroying my family more then it already is. She then said that he apparently has tried to contact her mom after the time they meet even tho my dad was married at the time and still is. 

The recent year he has been talking and texting with a female staff at his jobb. She lives in a different city and he said that he wants to go there and visit some old family friends but he dosent have contact with them and my gut is telling me there is a connection and that something isn’t good. It makes me feel disgusted too.

was getting much more tired but at least she was happy because of working

hard(sometimes because of that I get angry with dad because if he let her
work she wouldn't have to suffer this much for years) but after 2 years or a

I use disposable cups and popsicle sticks for mixing resin and paint. And also using carboard boxes as mats for my resin works and scratch paper as masking for my paint jobs.

It wasn't always like this. We used to play together. I used to protect him but after some time we tured against each other. I told him and my parents he shouldn't hang out with certain people because they weren't good people but he refused and my parents ignored me. I think they raped him. He never said anything to me about that. It's been a few years since then and he doesn't eat well, sleeps all day and doesn't attend his classes. I tried to protect him but he didn't listen and my parents were ignorant of the fact. Even in this last few years I told my parents and grandparents to send him to therapy but they just said it'll pass! I can't tell them about the rape thung because it would destroy thrm. Whenever i think about him i think it's all my fault. I could have done more. I was a teen myself back them but maybe i should have known better. I feel guilty.

1kcv8oa,How do I raise my siblings?,Fantastic-Ask-3041,"Hi all, just need some advice on this. 

I have 2 younger siblings that are 8 years under me, I'm 21M. My parents are much much older than they were when they had me. Not to say they're incapable of parenting anymore but I have stepped up a bit more. 

My siblings (M and F) are still early teens and they're spending all their time on their phones. I've been trying to get them to study more, or other stuff but my issue is, this has gotten to a point where I don't know how to make them listen to me anymore. I take away their phones, they ignore me for the rest of the day, I say go to sleep at 11,they're up till 1am watching stuff. I'll admit I've gotten very physical at times. Not to say my parents raised me purely with threats or all that, cause they didn't. But I have no idea how to handle my siblings other than take away their phones, shout at them and at the worst times, manhandled them. 

I want to guide them to do better but I think I don't know how to. Does anyone have any advice on getting kids to actually listen to you? And other ways to punish them, other than getting physical?

1kcu4cl,Why don't I feel any love for my family,BeneficialContest616,"I know I should probably see proper medical attention on this one, but I'm really afraid and I want to ask other people before I do anything rash.

**tldr:** I feel disconnected from entire family and i don't feel love for them, despite still having love for other things. Pretty normal and comfortable and loving childhood, yet  I don't feel love for them. Why? I feel really guilty for all the hard work and effort they put in for me and my siblings. what do i do? am i just abnormal?

Sorry for the huge wall of text, but please bear with me.  
I'm currently 16, and I am born into a middle-classed asian family with two other siblings, with me being the oldest.

My mom is very caring although very short tempered and has violent (not physically violent) outbursts sometimes and has arguments with my dad from time to time. She does a lot for the family and I really do appreciate for her hard work and all, as she wakes up early at 6 every morning to make food for the family, prepares all the meals and laundry and just about all the household chores. However, I don't feel a conscious thread of ""love"" towards her, more of just ""appreciation"" and a little bit of ""pity"" because I personally would crack if I was in her situation. I don't think i can truly say i love her with familial intent.

My father works hard everyday at home to earn for the family and he is very calm and matured, though I genuinely can't say I love him either because there are no stereotypical ""fondful memories"" that I can remember with him. He is more of just a ""really chill and helpful guy"" who I can rely on from time to time. In this sense, I don't really feel any emotion connections with him (maybe a little) and none of the familial love.

Both of my parents try to give us what we want to the best of their abilities and really tries to drill education into us for us to fulfill the asian prophecy (high grades and top academics). I feel guilty that I don't feel love for them despite all that they do. I know I still feel love for other people and other things like cats and my crush, though i haven't felt anything like that for my family.  The most interaction i have with them is my mom driving me to school in a car, us eating at the family table and for the rest of the day after i get home from school i lock myself in my room and do homework/play games/talk with other people.

Even when I was younger my mom and dad would just take me (my siblings were born much later) on trips and treated me very well in a safe and nice environment. in theory this should mean I should love them, right? i remember my environment being so nice that i'm not surprised if someone said i was spoiled.

As for my two siblings, my 7 year old sister and 9 year old brother, I don't and have never felt a shred of love for them since they were born as far as I can remember. They've always just been around me but I've never done or interacted with them and I remember yelling at them a lot because they really are really annoying (especially my sister) and I would love to be left alone (or be a single child). I feel guilty after every time I get mad at them because I think of the model brothers often seen on media and tv and I feel bad about how I treat my siblings, though it always ends up me being annoyed by them and never interacting with them. Honestly, I wouldn't mind living alone without any of these family members but I feel extremely guilty that I don't think I ""love"" them.

I'm not sure why and I know very well I'm not normal after seeing my other friends' relationships with their families and siblings. I also have suspicion that I am suffering from covert narcissism disorder, and I am trying my best to change recently. What can  I do? What should I do? I just feel really guilty.

1kcq4bl,"As a father, I’m heartbroken over my child’s relationship dynamic and don’t know how to talk about it without making things worse.",Cultural_World992,"My wife and I promised each of our children the same amount of money toward their weddings. Four are now married, and in each of those cases, their partners - or their partners’ families—contributed financially, which felt appropriate and appreciated.

Of our two remaining kids, one is a successful, confirmed bachelor who’s not interested in marriage or in taking anything from us. The other is engaged to someone who, unfortunately, has quit every job they’ve had. I doubt they have any savings, and it seems unlikely there will be financial support from their family. Meanwhile, our child is hardworking and career-focused.

As far as I know, their partner hasn’t contributed anything to the wedding and relies heavily on our child for financial support.

Over the years, I helped each of our children save money for their future; something to give them a bit of long-term stability. For this child, that savings has mostly been spent on rent and everyday expenses with their partner. Watching that nest egg disappear has been incredibly difficult—especially knowing that some of that money came from extended family members who genuinely wanted to support their future as well.

We’re still following through with our commitment and giving the same wedding contribution we gave the others. But I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t feel like we’re being taken advantage of. It seems like we’re funding someone else’s wedding and lifestyle, someone who hasn’t made much of an effort to contribute, build stability, or form a connection with our family.

I’ve tried to talk with our child about this. They were sad and remorseful at the time, but nothing really changed. They always defend their partner. I get it, loyalty matters. But it’s hard to feel like there’s any room left for honest feedback or concern from our side.

What makes this even more painful is how defensive our child has become - especially toward me. I’ve kept most of these feelings to myself out of fear of pushing them away. I’ve mentioned, gently, that I think their partner should contribute more, but I haven’t pushed it. The truth is, I don’t know if there’s any way to talk about this without hurting them, and that thought breaks my heart.

They spend far more time with their partner’s family than they do with us now. And it’s starting to feel like we’ve been quietly replaced. We used to be so close. I worry that we’ve lost that, and I don’t know how to get it back.

I’m not trying to buy their loyalty or control their life. I respect each of our kids for the choices they make and the people they’ve become. This isn’t about control, it’s about trying to preserve a relationship that means everything to me, without surrendering every healthy boundary to do it.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? How do you bring up these kinds of concerns, with honesty and care, without driving your child further away? I feel stuck. And honestly, I’m heartbroken.

As a side note...I keep asking myself: Do I hold back some of the money? Would that be fair? Would that be wrong? I'm truly not trying to punish anyone.  I just don’t know what the right thing is anymore.",21,14,1746152212.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kcq4bl/as_a_father_im_heartbroken_over_my_childs/

1kcp66x,Tired of my fucking sister,Lumpy-Fisherman9513,"Today I (m20) was at my father's birthday lunch, where my sister, my parents and I were there. My sister (f23) has always had serious problems (like arguments and even sometimes fighting) with my parents and since she was a teenager none of them have gotten along. 

My relationship with my sister has always been strange. She has a very strong personality that for some reason has never been compatible with mine. Without her realizing it, she often puts me down emotionally and treats me badly for simply not agreeing with her on certain mundane aspects of life. The problem is that since I was little I have always been a bit sensitive to teasing and often, especially from people like her, I get hurt by the things she says to me, which made me, right from the start, a bit of an insecure kid. She always calls herself a good sister, but I genuinely think I couldn't have gotten a worse sister who treats me like I'm trash, just because we don't have the same views on life or the same social contexts (she was always the popular one at school and I was always a normal guy you see around). She always thinks she has the right to call me out on the most unnecessary shit that shouldn't stress me out but ends up ruining my vibe. She thinks I should follow her example, even though she's the last person anyone should look up to. She has a fucking ego that makes me genuinely want to tell her to go fuck herself. 

Back to the original topic, and as I was saying before, my family went to restaurant to have lunch. As expected, my sister and my parents ended up fighting which made me extremely embarassed since everyone could hear it. After 30 minutes of arguing over some futile shit, I forgot to share the rest of a fucking drink with her cuz I forgot for some reason. Simple as that. Somehow she got extremely angry, saying that I dont value her as a sister, that I did that on purpose and that I was stupid. I didnt even answer cuz Im genuinely so tired of her that I dont even have the energy to fight back.

People usualy see me as a chill dude whos playfull and stuff but for some reason, whenever she is around my vibe just fucking dies and I lose all my social skills. I dont know what to do cuz im tired of my family in general, but specially my sister

And im sorry if my explanation or my english werent clear enough cuz its not my first language.",3,4,1746149224.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kcp66x/tired_of_my_fucking_sister/

As we normally talk u casually as how my brother is during in basketball and just in general.Keep in mind my brother birthday is coming up in July. So I ask him what are we doing for his birthday. And he tells me we’re going to California. Which makes NO sense to me because every time I ask to go somewhere for my birthday it’s always “we can’t do it” or a “mb son”. And that totally fine because me and my brother typically don’t have big party’s.But the think that blows me is the way I wanted to go to a trampoline park for my birthday which is like a hour and a half away from the hotel we were staying at. And when I asked to go it was a no.which makes no sense because he’d rather take a 3 hour flight spending at least 400$.But he can’t take me a hour and a half to where I wanted to go. And it not like it’s the first time b/c last year I wanted to go Wisconsin Dells which was a no but head go head and take his girlfriend’s daughter (my brothers mom).And I want to text and confront him about it but it always the same damn dumb explanation about how “money tight” and I how he treats all his kids fairly.But at this point I don’t even want to go on this trip anymore ,3,3,1746148485.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kcoxny/im_upset_and_confused/

About six months ago my biological mother, unfortunately passed away. It was very traumatic and cost my fiancé and I almost all the money we had in our bank accounts. This past weekend, my stepmother made a comment only to my fiancé that a memorial set up for my mom should be a photo of her instead. On top of other disrespectful things that happened this past week I decided to confront her.
I am a non-confrontational guy, I try to diffuse situations. When I approached her with these grievances, she denied all of them. I said my fiancé would not lie, but at that point, it’s just he said she said. I aired everything I wanted to say the conversation was basically pointless. Now I feel sick to my stomach over what happened. But there is no way for it to have gone better if the other person is just going to keep denying it.

I have some neurogical disease from lead poisoning from my childhood and I have a hard time explaining stuff to people, so in general, I had a hard time getting friends, but he had patience and he accepted me. I noticed early on that he has some crazy stories, but as a kid I didn't really care about it/haven't paid too much attention to it, so we got along. Now more then a decade later I am stuck. I already had my doubts about him but last month I asked him to be my best man at my wedding which will take part next year. Before I asked him, I already talked with my fiancèe that I have doubts about him, because he's constantly lying and my fiancèe noticed it too through the years. I said to my fiancèe that since I already promised him that he'll be my best man over one drunk night out, that I'm gonna be true to my word and ask him. Well he came for a visit after a long time we haven't met, and in a little ceremony I asked him to be the best man. He of course accepted, and we celebrated, but during the evening after, he started saying the crazyest stuff I ever heard one after another. Literally he was telling lies anytime he opened his mouth. Just to mention some: he said that he did his C1 language exam in Japanese, but when I said a very general Anime line to him on Japanese, he couldn't translate it. He said he's taking riding lessons for motocycles because he's been drivin 10 years without license, but when I wanted him to drive my motocycle he couldn't even turn it on and he quit saying he doesn't want to break my bike, he said that he drove a plane from London to Athens once because noone else was on plane except he and the pilot, and the pilot felt bored and showed him how to drive, and that he started his own business in buying and selling cars for profit, but when asked to show me some photos of the cars he bought, he showed me some cars that have been put on website by other people and thought that I won't notice it. These are just a very few things he said, but believe me, by the end of the night, my fiancèe and I were going crazy. At the end I started calling him out on his BS and he noticed himself. We ended the night, and I haven't really heard from him since, we just exchange memes. Other thing that's annoying about him is that any crazy story we tell him that actually happened to us, he shakes them off and tells us an even crazyer story (lie) that happened to him, all in the same context, but he adds stuff to it. He makes you feel that he's life is so special like a movie, and we are just shits compared to him.

1kckhmx,My younger sister is so annoying.,bootyinjector69420,"I know this doesn't really seem like a problem to most people based off of the title, which is kind of why im here in the first place. I wanted to know if this kind of behavior i talk about is an actual problem or just her being her age? (i have no other younger siblings or let alone any other sisters)

  
She is 13, and her attitude/behavior has gotten worse and worse over the years.

Her behavior isn't just like mood swings like girls usually get during puberty, but her attitude and behavior is constant and practically non-stop whenever she comes out of her room.

  
The main thing she does that just annoys me and makes me angry is having an attitude ALL. THE. TIME. 

Earlier today i asked her to stop leaving water bottles everywhere, i said word for word ""hey, when you're done with your water bottles can you either dump them out in the sink or in the cats water dish?"" and while i said that she just said ""shut up, shut up, shut up."" note that i didnt have a forceful or bossy tone, i tried to say it as calm as i possibly could. 

  
that wasnt just one instance which wouldnt be the the sole reason im writing this anyway, she does that shit all the time, almost everytime she comes out of her room. and, she complains whenever i eat some of her snacks or food even when she eats all of my food and drinks and i dont complain about it?

  
she leaves messes everywhere, NEVER and i mean this as strong as can be, she NEVER cleans up after her self. her room is an absolute disaster and rancid... she leaves food and drinks left over from weeks upon weeks just rotting in her room and when either me or one of my parents finally brings them out cause she cant herself, the food is rotten and stains the plate/bowl/cup.

for instance: a couple days ago she had some cereal, which when i came out of my room, there was cereal all over the counter, i asked my parents to tell her to clean it up since if i told her then my parents would yell at me. but, my parents just said ""well if it bothers you then you clean it up"", like it isnt my mess to clean up?

  
the only times shes ever had a clean room is when my mom cleans it cause theyre sick of the stench. and even like only a week after her room being cleaned, its a complete disaster and stinks again.

  
to me personally, this does not seem like ""her being just her age"" this seems like an actual problem. my parents say they ""try to help"" and are ""really trying to make her better"" but honestly to me... i can only believe that a little but, they say how hard theyre trying but they just arent, at least from my point of view.

1kcj9w7,Am I too soft on the kids?,Ok_Reserve1611,"Hi all, just looking to see if anyone has dealt with conflicting issues with their partner over decisions with the kids.
My partner who I have been with for 10 years and  we have 2 young girls age 7 and 8 has said that he feels he is invisible and that I don’t ever listen to him when it comes to things with the kids.
He feels that I am far too soft with them and do too much for them and with them.  There are things that I take on board and I for sure probably do need to be a bit more strict with them either things like picking up after themselves or fetching things for themselves rather than asking me and they are definitely at an age they can manage that.  
I hate arguing with him but I do feel that I spend so much time with them because he gives them very little time. He does work hard and is often busy so I don’t expect loads from him but I sometimes feel he has no time for them at all so I think I overcompensate …. They often ask me to play with them just after dinner but they have to wait until I’ve cleaned up the kitchen…. They do go and amuse themselves until I am free but once I join them and play or we go a walk, bed time slips and I’ll get comments about how they should be in bed and he gets annoyed that it takes me a while to get them settled as I read them a story. He would like us to have more time in the evening. Tonight I suggested that if he helped in the evenings I would have them to bed earlier but he just goes on his PlayStation. He says that because I don’t listen to him about being more firm is why I have problems. His words were “it’s your bed you lie in it” or “made a rod for your back”
I do agree that we’ve become distant because we don’t spend a lot of time together and often once the kids are asleep I will spend time on my own sometimes just scrolling or catching up on work. He goes from his game to the bed and gets upset that I don’t come to bed early. I do need to try and get a better routine with the kids but I just feel a bit stuck. I don’t really know if I’m looking for advice or just other opinions. Ps my kids aren’t terribly behaved they are sweet little girls they are a bit lazy and I do back down and run after them too much.

He’s known for being a bit mysoginistic and homophobic, so this surprised me as I was expecting dads to be standing up for their kids or something but instead the account is just full of extremely mysoginistic shit. Just completely woman-hating, calling them lazy, saying it’s their fault they get objectified, calling feminism a scam, etc etc. I know he’s family and I should look past that kind of stuff but it just makes me angry and sad and if this is the kind of stuff he’s looking at and agreeing with I find it a bit hard to associate with him. 
There’s another account he follows of these only fans girls with suggestive reels and they’re putting on the childish act and they genuinely look like kids. I have a 15 year old stepsister who wears the same clothes. I know I’m probably thinking into it too much but just knowing he probably derives some sick pleasure from this stuff just makes me feel a little ill. And there are a bunch of other sex accounts he follows too of course. 
I wish I’d never looked 😭 don’t know what I was expecting. The comments he makes in public are sometimes really disgusting but his girlfriend is just as bad. It’s really hard to hang out with them without wanting to actually jump off a bridge because they always find a way to make me and my sister uncomfortable. Sometimes I notice them influencing how my sister speaks; she starts making horrible comments about random people in public because they do. They also find ways to bring sex into every conversation and I find it really weird. When they do I normally just don’t answer or I take Cleo away from the table. Do I stand up to them? Do I just avoid my Taid from now on? I want to protect my sister too but we don’t live together so it’s her dad’s decision to keep them in her life. All the men from that side of the family who have like 3 kids are also following a bunch of weird porn on their social media. So hard to even have faith in my own family sometimes. It’s shit.

1kchzpf,I hate my life,Hefty-Item4902,"I am a 27F. I had an abortion roughly 4 years ago and I regretted it so much. Weeks would go by, and I maybe had roughly 30 hours of sleep. I pleaded to God for his forgiveness. I felt so guilty and I decided I was against abortion. 

I recently got caught up with the wrong guy 32M who masked as someone he wasn’t. Once the mask was lifted, I realized he is a horrible human being who is financially/emotionally unstable, a drug addict, and is also obsessed with his ex. He got me pregnant while I was trying to dig deep into my spirituality and my opinions on abortion were even stronger. We had discussions about what would happen if I got pregnant because he came in me every time we had sex. We had unprotected sex a lot. He claimed that we would figure it out. Based upon his actions I’m assuming that he was avidly trying to get me pregnant. I guess I was too, because of the guilt I experienced from my previous abortion. To make it even worse, we never had a romantic, playful relationship and are the furthest thing away from being in love. Come to find out, he was having sex with 5 other girls and his ex regularly during this time. It disgusted me so much. Someone cannot give a fuck about you so much that they are cumming inside you while increasing the risk of you getting an STD or maybe getting more than one girl pregnant at one time? It blows my mind how horrible people can be. 

A little more background information: at the beginning of my pregnancy, my hormones were raging and I did not cope with it well. I was making irrational decisions. I moved out of the town we were both living in to move in with my mom. During this time he was accusing me of lying about being pregnant and treated me so badly, something I will NEVER forget. Claiming he wants to be with someone who cares about their appearance, while he has a horrible reputation from being a junky. When he found out that I moved, he moved locations too, but soon got evicted. Which makes me wonder if he couldn’t pay rent at his place before moving. He had to move in with his mom. He then ended up losing his job because of his coke addiction.

At this time he was pretty down bad. He used me and the baby to convince his mom to help him financially to provide stable living quarters for me and my child. When I visited him for a weekend to move some of my things in and prepare for our child, he stayed out all night and did coke until around 4-5 am. (My baby is in NICU) One night my baby’s doctor called me claiming he needed emergency surgery, which he didn’t end up needing. He seemed as though he didn’t care and just wanted to me to stay there. I couldn’t understand why he didn’t care as much as I did. I decided to not move in with him because I don’t want my kid around drugs and we didn’t connect in a relationship kind of way. It was honestly weird being there. I can’t be vulnerable with people who are weird acting. 

I ended up moving my stuff out of his place. He was so upset about it and didn’t speak to me the entire time. He didn’t even help me bring my things to the car after I just had a c-section. I had forgotten the parking pass I was using when I stayed there. He claims he was upset over that. He probably needed it for the girls that he sleeps with. To make matters worse, I noticed he didn’t have on his bracelet (what is required to see our baby in NICU that has my name printed on it). He said he woke up one morning and it was off, he ripped it off in his sleep. While he wasn’t there I looked through his stuff to find it, especially in his night stand, and could never find it. He definitely lied about that. 

He recently visited the town that we lived in together for a wedding, yet he can’t take off of work or borrow his family’s car to come see his kid. At the end of his trip he informed me he was on his way to the hospital to see our son. I accused him of using our son so that he could borrow his mom’s car to whore around (his ex that he was booking up with was at the wedding). He needed me to get into the hospital. Considered everything I wrote before, I didn’t go to the hospital to let him in. He texted me and said “fuck you, we’re done.” 

During my pregnancy I worked two jobs and ended up having to have an emergency c-section at 30 weeks due to developing HEELP syndrome. Not one time did he come and visit me, or want to help me. He and his mother just accused me of lying and created so much drama in my life that I cried almost every day. Now I am stuck in this charity house while my baby is in NICU, rotting away. I’m so depressed and I wish I could visit my friends and experience life and be happy again, but I know that’s over with bc I don’t have anyone to watch my son. Everyone’s thinks that since I had a kid so irresponsibly that I shouldn’t be able to enjoy life anymore. 

Meanwhile all of this is happening, he tried to love bomb me, use me to pay his utilities, and dog me every chance he got bc he isn’t happy with who he is. He’s so insecure that he tries to bring me down every chance he gets. I have experience so much trauma from this experience, I do not want any more kids. I just don’t know how to get over this 😭😭. I’m also obsessed with stalking his ex on social media because she looks better than me. 

I don’t know what to do, who I am, or what I want. I’ve been contemplating giving my kid up for adoption, something I’ve been thinking about since pregnancy. 

Oh and by the way, we had sex when I visited him that weekend and I am now pregnant again!!!!!!! I am so disappointed in myself. I guess from where I have zero fun or interests or hobbies, I result to risky behavior for a dopamine rush. I have an appointment scheduled with planned parenthood for an abortion. I keep telling myself that I should’ve aborted the kid I have now. He was born premature because the dude got me pregnant before him, had an unknown miscarriage (didn’t know I was pregnant at the time) and immediately got pregnant again. 

I just blame him for ruining my life. He lives in a fantasy world and somehow I got lost in it as well. I wish I could just rewind the last two years of my life and do everything differently. At least whenever I hold my baby now all of my problems seem to go away. I think I’m having second thoughts about keeping my baby because of my hormone spike and feeling so down.

1kcgmdx,Need advice : My mum entertained a relative’s wife despite serious past abuse in the family,BB-8-quester,"
When my sister was a child, a cousin of ours seriously misbehaved with her. It was a traumatic experience for her and our family. Ever since..we have kept a deliberate distance from that side of the family.

We are not sure if his wife is aware of what her husband did, but recently she showed up at our house completely uninvited while other guests were also present.

My mom, being a chronic people-pleaser, dint say anything. Instead, she entertained the cousin’s wife and her kids with tea and snacks, acting like everything was normal. This really upset me. It felt like our family’s pain was being brushed aside just to avoid awkwardness.

Am struggling with how to process this. I want to be respectful to my mom, but I also feel we have a responsibility to uphold boundaries, especially when it involves protecting a survivor in our own family.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation where family prioritizes social niceties over emotional safety?",5,6,1746125872.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kcgmdx/need_advice_my_mum_entertained_a_relatives_wife/
1kcfkhh,My mom doesn’t approve my relationship because my bf is from another city,Equivalent_Rip9356,"So I 19/F started uni on october 2024 , and theres a coffe shop near my dormitory where my now bf works 18/M .For the first month we only made eye contact and small talk but then i decided to leave a small note for him and since then we have been talking non stop. He even introduced me to his mom and relatives so i thought its the best decision to tell my mom . I know its a bit early but my mom always said to tell her if i ever start talking to a boy and for religious purposes. It was all great and stuff she asked first if i was talking to someone and it was going all great until i told her hes from another city. She just started yelling at me saying bad stuff to me saying what will your uncle think that your dating out of my city. She made everyone in my family against me and told everyone a different story to me she said its bad because hes from another city, to my nephew she said she needs to finish university first , to my dad she said she wants do drop out of uni to be with him. Also she made my brother call me and say to me that she locked herself in her room and has been crying for hours but i called her literally 2 min after and she was all okay and she just said i dont want him hes from another city and people there are bad. She didn’t even give him a chance for him to show himself and how he is. I said to her im taking him for me not for you and she just went crazy after that. Then my dad made me choose either university and leaving him or leaving him and university too . The week this happened i was in university and when it came time to go back home ( i go home every weekend) i got so scared so did my bf , he got so stressed that he suffered high blood pressure for like 2 weeks. He got really scared that my family wont let me continue university anymore, and i felt so bad , he would get sick every night and i would send him to the hospital. I was so scared i would loose him. We want to continue our relationship but i dont know how if my family finds out i will never see him again. I just don’t understand why my mom doesn’t approve him. She only wants me to date someone from my city or arrange a marriage for me since she said im in med school and everyone will want me for their son , but she doesn’t realise that they want me for their son but their son will not want me. So we made a plan to try again after a while and if they still don’t approve i will just leave my family because im tired of my manipulative mom. So would i be wrong if i just left? My mom has always been manipulative and self centred like this her whole life she wants her to be happy and no one else. If u guys have any advice or other ideas what i can do please tell me cuz im stressing a lot .

1kcdz5n,Looking for advice/encouragement.,Aware-Passenger1022,"I am 30f. My father died when I was 12. I have a sister 3 years younger to me. My father was a hiv/aids patient and my mom is hiv patient too which we didn't know till my father died as he didn't disclose it to anyone in the family. After my father died my mom wasn't able to do anything and my mom's brother looked after us. He got married the year my father died and they both looked after us. I don't want to disrespect them but I always felt that they looked after us just to look good for outsiders not because they loved us or anything. My aunty is the type to have control over everything and we let her have that till now because of my mother as my uncle brings all my mom's medicines . Me and my sister were both sexually assaulted by my aunt's father but no one knows about it. My aunt did so many disrespectful things to us but we never told our uncle because of fear. Coming to present because of all of these me and my sister developed so many health issues. And in the middle of all of this I was forced to get married for which I paid all the money. My sister wasn't able to attend my marriage because of all of their plans.But my aunt portrayed to everyone that she put all her money into my marriage, they didn't even pay a single rupee. My mom is a government pensioner and all the access to money lies with my uncle. Me and my sister are both employed, we studied hard and got jobs. Last month my sister tried to come home to us without our uncle and aunt not knowing but some stupid relative of ours saw my sister and let our uncle know about it for which they stopped talking to us.
I just wanted to rant because every one says to just reconcile with them, but we know how hard it is. I just wish they never took us in. It's really hard to live under someone like them. I don't even enjoy my marriage life.

They made my sister work like a maid for them and their children and now they say they looked after her like their own daughter and that we didn't do anything for them. We did so many things for them and their family. They didn't even care about my sister's health.",2,1,1746119314.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1kcdz5n/looking_for_adviceencouragement/

1kccjuk,Help! Is my 14-yo daughter brainwashed by my ex?,hugegoldiefan13,"I divorced my vebally abusive husband, let's call him Dick, 13 years ago, when my daughter, Sara, was 17 months old. He immediately found a partner, called Katie. I quite like and trust her. My ex has since taken me to court twice to get full custody, bc he doesn't want to pay support, and has been laughed out of court every time. (I'm a successful professional with no record of mental health or drug abuse.) We have 50/50, and he pays a fraction of what the law would mandate bc I took pity on him.

They have two other kids, 10 and 12, and have recently announced they are getting a divorce, something that has been brewing over the course of the time period I'm about to get into.

Over the past two years, strange things have been happening with my daughter. First, she started seeing a therapist after asking me to get her one without her dad knowing. (She said she wanted this bc she wanted to live with me full time). I said no bc it's wrong to do that behind his back, and bc I don't hold her insurance. I told her I'd talk to him about getting her one and he did. That therapist ended up being extremely young, allowed him to sit in on sessions, also took on Sara's younger half sister as a client, and never asked to meet me (or for me to sign off on her treatment) until a year into therapy when I was called into a session and was told by Sara she wanted to live with her dad, who was, strangely lurking in the waiting room during our session. Things went south fast and Sara couldn't seem to go through with it when I started asking questions about when these feelings started and stormed out. The therapist did not know 1. whether I had other children or 2. that I lived in another town 20 mins away.

A week later, I asked my therapist to facilitate a conversation with my husband, who has been in the picture for 12 years, Sara, and I. Sara pretty much just dug in and wouldn't really open up about why she suddenly wanted to live w her dad. When my ex caught wind of that conversation, he dragged my daughter into a deposition to try to get my therapist's license revoked. This is who we're dealing with.

Last summer, he took her on a two-week vacation, the longest he's ever had her at one go. Because he refused to let me know his plans until the last minute, the only week left in the summer for my vacation time with her had to start on the day they got back. Sara was in good spirits and texting and calling regularly thru her dad's vacation until about halfway through. Then, a few days before she was meant to return, she called me and absolutely tore into me as a parent and as a person. She accused me of trying to drive a wedge between her and her other household for years — this is not true. I am a product of divorce and while my father was a deadbeat, my mother's constant diminishment of him behind his back made him more lovable/pitiable in my eyes my entire childhood, so I don't play that game.

We went on our vacation in August and I thought we were better. Then one day in October, I wake up to a text that her father committed her to a mental hospital bc she was threatening self-harm. This came out of absolute left field for me - easily the scariest most traumatic thing I ever experienced.

We had to meet with her care team that first day and she refused to let my new husband into the meeting bc she ""doesn't see him as a parent, but as a big brother."" I was furious that Dick would go so far as to commit her without speaking to me first, but I went into emergency mode and let that slide, as the only thing that mattered was Sara's well-being. Her week in the hospital was strange, and she kept saying how good it was for her to be there, and vaguely stating a fight with her stepmom is what prompted the trip to the er, but she would not give any more details.

We've been working with a family therapist ever since, and I suppose it's helped me tolerate being in the same room as my ex, and her work with my kiddo has been better than that other one (who we fired), but otherwise I haven't seen much improvement. Sara typically goes with the flow, and continues to come to our house 50 percent of the time, but over the last couple of weeks, Sara has been blowing up at me when I try to talk to her about why she dislikes my husband/our household.

She is back to saying that she does not want to spend time at our house, and I cannot get a straight answer from her other than that my husband and I are not parents to her in her eyes. I told her I disagree, and she gets incredibly hostile but cannot back her claim. Last night, she tells me that when she was 9, she and her step mom had a terrible relationship and that she, Sara, hated her. She says she wanted to come live with us back then. Now, she says she sees the error of her ways and realizes she was ""being a brat."" I drew a parallel between how she's now feeling that way toward my husband and she got super angry and said it was not the same thing. After rounds and rounds of me trying to draw out of her what she needs from us (aside from my husband to stop harping on her about her excessive phone use), she began to scream and cry and went to her room.

When I followed her up, about 45 seconds later, she was on the phone with her dad, but pretended she wasn't. I assume she hung up on him, but for all I know, he was still on for the rest of our conversation. First, she said she was going to have him pick her up. I asked her not to, we had a very calm conversation, and she started to relax and return to normal. We didn't discuss much, I just explained to her how much I love her and how much I want her to be with us. Things calmed down, and then I suggested she get her shower and we'd watch a movie before bed. Next thing you know, I hear something on top of the sound of running water in the bathroom, and she's on the phone w her father SOBBING, and relaying the story to him. And while, on one hand, she was being fair in her retelling (tho I only caught about 3/4 of the about 5-minute conversation) what I did *not* hear were, again, any substantive complaints about what we're doing wrong and what she needs from us, NOR did hear from *him* anything like desescalation or, god forbid, defense of me.

Here are her complaints:

 \-She told me that she can't talk to me about anything, even though she said in family therapy only days earlier that she could tell me anything. 

\-She also said I was not a good mom and that she believes I shit talk about her behind her back — again contradicting what she said in therapy about how she wasn't worried about me talking negatively about anyone anymore. (I shouldn't have to say this, but there was nothing to be worried about to begin with.)

\-She keeps saying she's going to give me ""one last chance"" — to do what, I do not know— and then she's writing me off. Also, when I prod too deeply about when and why she had this revelation about me (aka after two weeks on vacation with her dad a year ago), she says she has a strong mental wall around this topic, and, if it breaks, then she's going to be back in the mental hospital again. 

\-Every time I try to tease out clarification to a contradictory statement or something that doesn't ring true to me, she claims I'm manipulating her. (Ex: When she called me from her dad's vacation — to ream me out for being a terrible mother — she also tried to get out of going on vacation with me when she returned. I told her that was not an option, that we had plans with my family, and that she had four little cousins dying to see her. She now claims I was manipulating her by using her cousins against her, even though she will happily agree that she and her cousins had a great time that week.)  

The things she's saying to me are breaking my heart and make me feel so completely untethered from my own experience. She keeps saying that her father and Katie helped her so much by putting her in the mental hospital because she was struggling so much with this, and she's using it as proof of my failures. But of course, I didn't know that her dissatisfaction with my household was this pointed — only that she had some kind of meltdown on vacation, but I thought we'd mended that. (Let's not forget that Sara herself cited a fight with Katie as the reason she had a mental health breakdown when we met with her social worker at the hospital.)

But this rift was being continually discussed behind my back with Dick, someone whose only goal since we split was to gain full custody — a goal that is likely more pronounced now that he's facing down another divorce.

One last crucial point: The only other times I have found myself so pointedly questioning my own reality was during my marriage to Dick. This feels exactly like the trauma of gaslighting and invalidation I experienced in that marriage on a regular basis. And yes, some will point out she's been unhappy with me for a while. But my point is that when I try to work on things with her and tell her I'll pursue any solution she'd like (including leaving my husband with whom I have a great marriage), she cannot say what it is she wants or needs.

Has anyone ever experienced this? I'm feeling awful about myself, heartbroken, and I feel certain that I don't deserve this.

1kcayrh,"Son Upsetting His Father, What's the Best Way to Respond?",,"So a little bit of past context if this helps for understanding the situation, my father lost his father when he was in his early teenage years and was depressed for years and clearly missed that fatherhood connection and learned things on his own instead but broke out of that.

Fast forward he's in his 50s and he does care for me (Im in my early 20s) and my family, he works so much, and constantly lives in a sort of fight or flight mode where even the smallest no updates leaves him panicked and worried that something's gone wrong because he's lived in a tough world. For instance today I was texting my father while on the train (he knew I was on my usual commuting train) then he didn't reply for a few minutes and I didn't get the seen message so I decided to quick study for 5 minutes, next thing I know, he texts me like 5 times asking hello where am I etcetera, then I texted ""Sorry dad I was studying"" and he said ""You're such an idiot I was worried. I will talk to you later."" The last bit means he's REALLY mad and I'm about to get a whole lecture that ends up pointing all the little mistakes I make.

What do I do in this situation? I know my father loves and cares for me and my family, so I don't want to say something anymore stupid, but I'm also panicking that he's super mad and upset. I'm not looking for a get back at him type of thing God no, but I'm just conflicted on what am I even supposed to do in this situation.

1. Doesn't brush his teeth, even on days he ate garlic and makes the whole house smell like rotten cabbage
2. Says offensive stuff on the daily basis (ex; racial slurs, mocking autism and down syndrome, says he would have offed me if I happened to be born with autism or down syndrome, homophobic slurs, misogynistic slurs/remarks)
3. The other day he asked if all women are ""this oblivious"" because my mom and I didn't see my older brother's car after they moved it, and said ""ooh a feminist"" in a mocking tone when I called him out.
4. Sexualizes my cat(ex; calls her a bitch, whore or slut because she goes out sometimes and interacts with other cats. She's spayed. Says he'll molest her/make out with her. Points out her genitalia and butt whenever it's visible)
5. Told me to go sleep outside if I'm so disgusted with him because I sprayed perfume on my bed(we sleep in the same room due to our housing situation) of course I am. He gets so offended and can't even handle it when I sleep in the kitchen, why is my only options suffer all night or suffer all night.
6. Leaves out dishes, wet laundry, mess on the counter, leftover food in the pot for days. and tells me no man will ever marry because I don't clean up his mess. Kind of ironic.
7. Blows in my face and has no oral hygiene at all
8. Describes ways he would murder me, can we not normalize this? Your brother talking about how easily their air punch could have killed you or how easily they can overpower you is not okay. They're thinking about violence and specifically violence against you, when did we stop taking people who have messed up thoughts seriously?

That's all and no I don't care if he has some undiagnosed mental illness, I don't care about anything to do with him unless it's affecting me. He never was and never will be my sibling, I refuse it.

TLDR: he's unhygienic and has very problematic views(racist, homophobic, misogynistic, ableist ect.) that he often voices only when he's at home or talking to strangers on his pc.
