Stop listening to her health issues and ask her to call a health hotline, or her doctor? If she's worried about falling, you can get her one of those health alerts in a lanyard.

1kvnhp5,mub0ykz,Playful_Leading_2601,"Sorry you’re going through all that OP. It sounds like you’re always trying to earn their love and prove to yourself that you’re deserving of their approval and love. I can relate. I am the second oldest of 5 and the youngest two always got preferential treatment. It’s tough. I struggled for a long time to feel like I was enough and still fall into old habits. 

You sound like a hard worker. Tenacity counts for a lot more in success and independence than talent or intelligence (although it sounds like you have those too) which means you can find your way in the world and build the life you want. 

I highly recommend that you do therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy was an absolute game changer for me in the best way possible. I’ve done therapy but also read books about it. Both help. (Also, Rising Strong and The Gifts of Imperfection by Brene Brown are amazing.)

Also, I moved away and specifically made an effort to be around people I wanted to be more like. Volunteering, church communities, dance communities, etc. gave me a place to get to know wonderful people who I became friends with and I was able to see other ways to resolve conflict and manage family relationships. I then would take those lessons into therapy and see what I could sort of… try on? Like I would talk to my therapist and say “I saw someone handle something this way and I want to be able to do that” and she would give me tools that I could practice which changed how I’d talk to family. 

Reactions to my changed behavior have been mixed over the years but it’s gotten easier as people have gotten used to the new me. (And sometimes I’d have to say something like “I’ve been thinking about how I have always done that and it hurts me in this way so I’m trying something different” and then I’d thank them for their patience and support or say “I know this is hard for you but our relationship is important to me and I’m hoping this will help when conflict like this comes up.” Or something to that effect. Again, I’d practice with my therapist beforehand. And oftentimes, people still needed time and space to process those changes before they could accept them. But it let me be proud of who I was in handling it and the kindness and calmness of how I handled things gave us space to be healthier when we they were ready.

That being said, it’s not easy to make those changes. I remember one fight with my mom that was especially painful as I started the process of changing my responses. She blew up at me for something my sister had done but my sister was gone so she decided to yell at me about it. I politely and calmly explained that I thought my sister was doing the best she could and that my mom should ask her about it. My mom continued to escalate things so I excused myself to walk away. She followed me into the bedroom and cornered me, blocking the door, hands on her hips, just tearing into me (verbally.) I was intimated, frustrated, and going through some big hard stuff she knew about so I was angry. Our previous pattern was to blow up, have a heated and emotionally exhausting shouting match, and then reconcile (usually with my mom being “right”) and act like that was healthy. Except it was pushing us apart. So I tried to change things in this fight and used the tools my therapist gave me to diffuse things. It would have worked except that my mom was looking for a fight. She just kept coming at me (verbally.) So I finally shouted at her and called her out on how she was badgering me to get a response. I don’t remember everything I shouted but I remember saying “is this what you want? You want me to shout? Okay, I’m shouting!” I reminded her of what I was going through and told her I had tried to diffuse it but she was so mean. I was so emotional by then. She broke down crying and started to literally say “oh my baby” and tried to give me a hug but I refused. I should have left (we were at my grandparents for Thanksgiving) but I didn’t have my own car at that point. 

The reason I share all that is to say this: it’s a (worthwhile) process to change. That fight was so hard. I used new tools, I tried so hard, and it ended the same way as always. BUT. I didn’t give up. That was early in the process. I went back to therapy and explained what happened. I told my therapist I never wanted to go through that again. She gave me new, additional tools that have helped in similar situations. (Gaining my independence and taking room where needed has helped a lot too.) Things are much better. I have healthy boundaries with my mom and others that now allow me to maintain the healthy parts of our relationship so I don’t have to completely cut them off because of bad behavior. And things are not perfect. But they’re so much better.

In fact, I saw some family tonight and had to use some of those tools and hold healthy boundaries and it worked. My husband even commented on how well I managed it, and… while I wish I didn’t have to do that… it did allow us to have some nice time and make good memories tonight too. To me, that’s worth it and I’m really proud of that progress.

I know this is long but I hope that helps. You can change your responses and dynamics. Therapy is so helpful (especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and you’re absolutely worthy of love, respect, and belonging just as you are.",1,1748244478.0

I later found out that it was because her mother didn’t want to believe her when she told her that her grandfather had molested her. Because of that, nobody said nothing. The day of that grandfather’s funeral, almost all of his granddaughters came out with the same thing. He had molested almost all of his granddaughters. 

I knew this to be true because of an incident with one of those granddaughters when I was very young. He had been calling her while she ignored him. After I told her that she has to respect her elders. She shoved her shoulder against mine. I decided to wait for her. After a couple of minutes (because I started watching a movie) I was thinking to myself that she was taking too long to return. I was going to go up the stairs to make sure she was ok, but instead I feel her shove me again and I stood in front of her grandfather fixing the top of his pants with a smirk on his face.

In those years, my mom got sick and big pharma kinda got her hooked onto pain pills, bad. Since she’s sick, no one else sees her as an addict, but she abuses the pills along with alcohol and in those years where my sister was moved out, I saw my mom change and turn a type of evil. She would always say the most fucked up things, and matter-of-factly she had made some messed up comments regarding my biological father as well (I never knew him). I’ve since cut my mother off bc I was just over the disrespect and abuse, but my sister still doesn’t grasp the severity of how hard it was growing up with a mom like that. She claims im too harsh on her. 
You “treating her badly,” as he put it, although I’m not sure what that entails or how old you are, isn’t really fair here - she is the parent, you are the child. We are all just products of our environment.  And it is not your job as the child to be the one that is the grown up. If we arent taught, how are we ever supposed to know any better??
As siblings, whereas you may have the same physical person as a parent, you definitely don’t always get the same version of that parent. Its sounds like you had to learn how to defend yourself whereas your brother might have learned to have less empathy for people. It’s really messed up, and you’re completely valid for feeling the way you do. I would consider just stepping back and limiting contact with them for a bit, or trying to put some boundaries down with your brother that if you guys interact, it’s best to not speak about your mother as you guys as this time will not see eye to eye.

It was speaking to them and them finally seeing what i was experiencing, one family member said ""sometimes you gotta cut loose"" so i did.
I'm 42 in July this year and had finally asked her to leave me alone in 2023, i hate that i cant share with her, but i know she's pure venom, i cried for years not understanding why she hated me so much, i let her get away with the abuse for years until i got a stomach ulcer from holding it in for so many years.

My brother is the golden boy, the one who was in rhe army amd was the angel of the family. She told so many lies that they all believed her, all but one brother (whom i am very close to) she had this habit of only abusing me when no one was looking but thru the years my friends would see and slowly so did my step father's family (whom I'd treated as my 2nd dad, never called him step, same as my brothers, we don't believe this half brother/sister shit). It was speaking to them and them finally seeing what i was experiencing, one family member said ""sometimes you gotta cut loose"" so i did.
I'm 42 in July this year and had finally asked her to leave me alone in 2023, i hate that i cant share with her, but i know she's pure venom, i cried for years not understanding why she hated me so much, i let her get away with the abuse for years until i got a stomach ulcer from holding it in for so many years. I am the eldest of 4 and all of my brothers have a different father to me (all the smae father with them)

I feel like I have gone backwards tbh, maybe i was wrong to say that she tortured me mentally and physically but its how I felt, I would question myself maybe I AM the problem but when my friends and some family members started spotting her behaviour, i realised I'm not. I wish she had an excuse (drugs/alcohol) then I could get passed it but she won't even accept any acknowledgement of what she did and just says ""I don't remember that"" but yet I was the child with behavioural issues at 2years old! 😳

I feel so shit, i wished I had never said anything to my brother at all, but he'd asked me do i speak to mum n dad, and i answered honestly...maybe that's my mistake. Maybe I am the problem...",1,1748097455.0

Her dogs have been aggressive towards my kids or anyone who tries to come over. And my mom said if her dogs did anything again that could hurt one of the kids or anyone, it would be the last thing they did on her property. So because my mom “threatened” her dogs, my sister blew up and said that she was leaving with her son and dogs, even though she has nowhere else to go really, saying that we’ve lost all right to see her son, my nephew, and she hated us, she hated my kids and that my mom was picking favorites. My sister needs serious mental help, she then proceeded to attack my husband who was holding our two year old son because he told her that her dogs were trying to bite people, I pulled her off him and she got me on the ground and started beating me in the head. People like that… you can do whatever you can to please them but they’re never really satisfied and they’re always going to be hateful.

1ktmv5r,mtyoioi,FancyPantsMead,"Modern grandparents are nothing like older grandparents.  I'm 49 and my dad and his wife still work. My grandparents, they both worked, (dead) my great grandparents ( great Grandpa is dead great grandma is alive)  were home all the time. Great great Grandpa was his own boss grandma was a great grandma and great great great great grandma were homemakers. Our parents usually have both parents still working. They have little down time and deserve to enjoy it to.


 My grandma told me everytime I need. To run  an errand under two hrs to bring her great grandson over to her! She would watch him because she was dying to see him and a few days a week she had the time.   She didn't feel she could do full time sitting for him, but when she did she make him feel as loved as she made me feel.and refused payment.


My husband's parents were much older than my family. His parents were the same age as my great grandparents. They waited to have kids til later in life because they simply didn't meet until they were 35. That was old to be starting your family 46 years ago. 
His parents retired early about the age of  59 or 63 ish I think.  They still had plenty of stamina and youth and now free time so they had our son a lot. From 4 months on is when we started letting family keep him overnight. He was a bottle baby. 


In fact we had so much help from both sides of family. My dad and his wife couldn't have my son as often since they both worked but they did every chance they could. It was much easier to get your time with him before he started kindergarten at 5.   So so so many people have been in his life. I took my baby brother and sister and raised them through highschool right after my son was born. He was attached At the hip with them. 

My sister is his best friend.  My brother is also one of his greatest friends. They are so alike it's crazy! 


My mom never ever watched our son because she could never get her shit together. Didn't trust her. 


Now that it's 19 years later, my sister in law just had her first kid. He's 3. The grandparents have shed and they can't keep the new little guy on their own.. our son  got much more involved grandparents from husband's family than his cousin just 3.  It makes us sad he won't get the same experience.   My husband and i are always willing to have the littles. I don't work so I have the time.   


All that to just say generations have changed so very much. Modern grandparents are busy, or they have aged too far up and don't feel up to it anymore. Those families who want to start in their late 30's early 40s, May have parents nearing retirement but no there just yet or if they are they got a life too.

That's my 2cents. I have never charged to keep an eye on family for emergencies but if I have to have them round clock and be their primary sitter then yes I will be paid. But it's not a lot at all. Mostly just helpse buy more toys and such. They bring the food and snacks in that case.

It’s nice if grandparents chip in on caring for their grandchildren for free but that is by no means a requirement, and she is providing a service. It seems harsh with your current financial situation but as someone who was home based childcare provider 50-60 week is an extremely cheap amount to charge per week to care for someone’s child. Rather you’re paying another babysitter or paying your mom you’d be paying someone to take care of your child regardless. I’ve had to have that same conversation with relatives who thought “because we’re family” they essentially expected free childcare because “it would help them out”. When I’d insist on a minimum 50 a week they would try to pay me only part of that and would ultimately end up paying another babysitter more or having to trust their kid with someone underage who’d  charge less but were irresponsible or didn’t have the same experience for dealing with unexpected things. I can also say most of that 50 bucks went back into the kid in some way. I will also say depending on where you live and if you qualify for any benefits you might be able to apply for child care assistance so the state pays for your childcare and you’d only be responsible for the sliding fee (like 2-4 dollars a day but that info last looked into 7 years ago).

It’s so clear that you’re doing your best, and it’s just not fair how much pressure is being put on you. I know your dad is sick, and of course we want to help our parents — but being sick doesn’t give someone the right to guilt you, control you, or take advantage of you and your mom. That’s emotional and financial manipulation.

Take this from someone your age — me — you’re not selfish for wanting to save or buy things for yourself. You deserve to take care of yourself too. The guilt you’re feeling just shows how much you care. It doesn’t mean you’re wrong.

Please don’t forget: you deserve rest, respect, and peace in your own home. And if you ever get the chance to talk to a professional about this, I really hope you do. But even now — the fact that you see what’s happening and are speaking up — that’s already incredibly strong.

1ksvpci,mtoryh1,stubbornpasta,"Just reading what you wrote, it’s clear how deeply you care, how much you’re trying to protect your son without robbing him of the truth. That’s not easy. You’re walking a really delicate line, and you’re doing it with love and strength.

Your son is in pain, yes — but he’s also waking up to truths that have been sitting quietly inside him for years. That pain he’s feeling? That’s not because of you telling him — it’s because of what actually happened. And now he’s trying to reconcile what he remembers with the denials and distortions he’s getting from the other side.

You warned him with honesty and love. And now that it’s unfolding just as you said, your role isn’t to fix it — it’s to keep doing what you already are: being his anchor. He doesn’t need you to have all the answers. He needs you to keep reminding him:

	•	That what he feels is valid.
	•	That he’s not crazy or overreacting.
	•	That the truth is sometimes ugly, but it’s his right to know it.

You said it’s hard to tell him even though he wants to know — and that’s so human. You’re protecting not just him, but probably your own heart too. And still, you’re showing up. You’re holding space for his anger, confusion, grief, and even his silence. That’s not just listening — that’s parenting with deep courage.

If you ever feel like you’re not doing enough, remind yourself: he’s talking to you. He trusts you with the messy parts. That means you’re safe to him.

You might not be able to take the pain away — but you’re making sure he doesn’t go through it alone. That’s powerful.

1ksvpci,mtppstc,moeluk,"I am party to a not totally dissimilar situation. My partners ex husband was/is a controlling wife beating emotional abuser. Ground her into the dirt (weirdly we got together because she went to a friends house who said he’s talking shit that “no one else would possibly love you with that raddled fat body and 4 kids”…and put her on match.com where she found me and we already knew each other thru friends and family)

Anyhow ex husband will adamantly deny he did nothing wrong, despite all of the above, and the kids witnessing it…including him threatening to commit suicide ripping a spindle from a cot and saying he’d stab himself with it. Literal litany of abuse and he did some bad things like subjecting his 4 year old son to a full medical exam because he said that I his stepdad had beaten him with a hammer.

Anyway all 4 kids have been curious and we’ve always taken the approach that we will tell them the truth. If they want to look over the statement diaries from court they are more than welcome to…and we completely understand that for a time they are torn between that emotional love with their dad and what essentially is reality.

Out of the 4 of them, the two girls really don’t entertain him any more. The eldest he has a cordial relationship with his dad but he just wants to keep the peace across everyone…and the youngest his dad buys him sweets and shit from car boot sales…but it’ll eventually wear off.

My mom was abusive but my dad just has always said that she has her ""problems,"" and leaves it at that. I figured out from knowing her and little hints here and there that she was a drug addict and she has severe mental illness. But my dad has always been compassionate. 

So maybe lead by example and say his dad had some issues at the time, you don't know how he is now, but at the time he was very toxic. Nothing that happened had to do with your son, and his dad wasn't ready to be a father. You love him unconditionally and if he wants to talk to and get to know his dad then he has that right. But nothing in his dad's behavior in the past or present reflects on him. His dad also doesn't even really know him, so if he has feelings of worthlessness just try to find a way to acknowledge that anyone in his situation would but he is very loved, deserves to be loved, and deserves to be respected.

1kstsg3,mtochav,Redcherry_6798,"See babygirl. I am facing a similar situation as what you're facing. 
My parents are so dependent on me that I have to fetch them a glass of water if they ask me to. 

I make food three times a day and its all treated like it's my duty and i get yelled at and accused if I raise voice against it. 

Although I'm turning 20 soon. 

My advice for you will be that I'm sorry baby you have to endure it . Because you can't escape things like these. 
The only way you can escape is becoming independent. 
I know it's very hard to focus on yourself when they're all over you telling you to do this. 
But you have to be strong and stubborn and take time out for yourself. 

Also I have a baby brother too. And my mother also does this where she thinks I'm not doing her any favour by taking care of him.

So I know what that feels like. But love him as much as you can okay? It isn't his fault that you have a mother like that. 

Lead with love and resilience.  You're strong and I'm proud that you went out and asked for help. That means you're open to change and willing to fight for your dignity and I respect you for it. 

But steel your heart and endure it along with putting yourself first in your mind. 

Build yourself up and try to be financially independent so you can say that I don't need you. So they can't say shit like we feed you so you have to do stuff for us.

I'm sorry that you have a mother like that you don't deserve it. But it's not in our hands. 

You can message me anytime you need to talk. I'll be there.

1kss7hq,mudy5pm,pam4him14,"I'm so sorry for the difficult situation.  It sounds like mom has an issue with boundaries.  If I'm understanding correctly, you are still living at home while she's abroad.  And she's trying to ""mother"" you long distance.  What if you schedule for chores.  Something easy like dishes done before bed, or perhaps if there's a dishwasher, rinse and load as you go.  Then one major chore a day. For example, Monday clean the bathroom, Tuesday, dust, Wednesday sweep & mop bare floors, Thursday vacuum, Sometime Fri-Sun laundry. That may be less mentally overwhelming.  Also, it would seem some boundary setting may be necessary.  Instead of constant accessibility, set a schedule with mom for one call per week with the only exception being a true emergency.  And let her know you will only be answering that one call and she's welcome to leave a message.  Then it's up to you to only answer the one call and to check messages in case it is something important. And maybe tell the neighbors they can feel free to not check on you.

It's not your problem that your still capable mother is choosing not to work. Parents do not bring children in the world expecting to be owed for it later. Your best solution is say ""I can't do this anymore"" and don't bother arguing about it. They had time to listen in the past now you need to put your words into action. You and your bf move to a place that is within your financial means and do not arrange plans to move your mother in as well. Keep her out. She'll have to find her own way in the world, even if it's living in a car or motel until she finds a job and gets on her feet it is her life she must take care of it.

1kscecp,mtlfzcv,Chance_Potato_333,"I had a very similar scenario, not as much financially but my mother was emotionally and physically dependent on me after my dad died in 2020. I moved in with her to help financially and she took complete advantage of me being there. We moved states in 2023 and she came with us, moved into our new house, made me do everything for her and refuses to work while she’s paying no rent or utilities or anything. Pays for her part of the groceries that’s it. 

Timing was in her favor as I was getting sick of everything as my sister decided to move to where we are and my mom decided to move in with her.

I had an ongoing feeling that it was my job taking care of her and I had to be the one to house her and deal with everything she needed. Well if that’s how you’re feeling, put your foot down now before it’s too late. Just because she raised you doesn’t make it your problem. Your mom seems a lot like mine and them not wanting to work does not mean we have to break our backs to make ends meet. If you can’t bring yourself to tell her how you feel, lie. I know I have before and still do, I don’t want to hear the shit she’ll say so I tell her something to shut her up and something that she can’t question. The lease being up and you needing to move is a great way to make it be done, even if you don’t move.

Their problems, addictions, and lack of honesty truly spills into everyone’s lives. All I can offer is sit down with your partner and explain your fears: financial, emotional, etc. Make a point to lay out all your boundaries. I know this doesn’t resolve anything but it makes it known that if your partner is involved these are your limits. Otherwise her family’s issues, addictions, and debt will swallow you as well. As for the resentment are you able to speak to a therapist? I find this incredibly important. If you can also find a couples therapist this works very very well also.

Obsessing over scenarios and choosing chatbot research over actually living and interacting with the world is definitely not neuro typical.  

You need a psychiatrist and probably a few evaluations stat.  The people telling you to just get out of your parents home likely are overestimating your ability to function prior to treatment.

You can’t just keep looking for a magical clean line where all the blame falls on one party which is, I suspect, one of your goals as you refine and refine scenarios in the chat bots.

Please get a job asap (maybe at a library or community center), finish up your school, enroll in affordable therapy and go at least once a week, and then start looking for a roommate or a room to rent so you can have your own space. Also go outside and walk for 15 minutes to an hour everyday- it will drastically improve your mood and give you more energy plus you may get chances to meet people and have better communication and connection with others. Don’t live in the simulation of your computer: go outside and be in the world",3,1747854607.0

With understanding even the best of parents and teenagers that sometimes we really lose control and just overreact and lash out when we shouldn’t. If this is a regular occurrence I’m sorry. That is much harder to deal with and is verbal abuse. 

The unfortunate thing is you can not make anyone change. Also, calling someone out or trying to talk it out in a moment your mom is acting like this is not the best time. Like for little kids no one hears and reasons well when they are in overwhelm. If you think it would help talk to your mom when she is calm and it’s just the two of you.

There are no mitigating circumstances, like him not understanding the word: NO.

He agreed to a plea bargain because otherwise he would have received a longer prison sentence, so I assume he is a first offender of this crime, that's also not the same as being innocent.

It sounds like you need to evaluate your relationship with this guy on a deep level. 

You’re dating a registered sex offender and want your family to accept it and let him go on family trips? Mmmm ya im with your family on this one. Im confused what advice you’re looking for here?  They’re not going to give af what you say to make this sound “ok” because he IS a sex offender. I don’t blame them. I wouldn’t want him on the trip with my family either and quite frankly you supporting someone like that is also very odd as well. 

After reading the comments you made below it sounds like you’re in denial. Time to wake up. 
What advice do you want from this post? Are you looking for Validation, that it’s ok? Or wrong of your parents? I’m actually confused.

Ask yourself this, are you willing to disassociate from your family and friends for a guy who has been convicted of sexual crimes against women? 

Sounds like your family really care about you and want you to consider ending the relationship by making situations like this uncomfortable… by not inviting him. 

you need to talk to a professional, because it seems like no matter what anyone says in the comments you’re creating excuses for him and refuse to accept that you’re dating a sex offender lol

1kqpibz,mtjt76x,stubbornpasta,"Hey, I just want to say you’re definitely not wrong for feeling angry or hurt. What you’ve been through with your dad sounds really tough, and anyone in your shoes would feel the same way. It’s totally okay to be upset and disappointed. Don’t feel like you have to forgive or “get over it” right away — healing takes time and you have to feel all those emotions first.

Setting boundaries is really important too. You don’t owe him unlimited chances or forgiveness just because he’s family. Protect yourself by deciding how much contact you want and what kind of treatment you’re willing to accept. At the same time, focus on your own growth and goals — your worth isn’t tied to how much he’s there for you.

Sometimes it helps to talk to people you trust or even write down your feelings, like a letter to him that you don’t have to send. And one thing to remember about forgiveness: it doesn’t mean what happened was okay or that you’re forgetting it. Forgiving is more about freeing yourself from the pain and moving forward without letting those bad memories control you.

You’ve carried so much already and you deserve kindness and respect. Give it to yourself. ❤️",1,1747864064.0

1kpwphr,mt1osx6,rabidcfish32,"Op I mean this with love you are so obviously an oldest child. Being oldest you probably won’t take my advice but please know you are not responsible for your siblings or making anything better between your family members. Your job is to be a kid. Well a teen. Be a good example for your siblings but do not take on parenting them. This is a situation for Alex and your parents to deal with between them. 

Glad to hear therapy is in place. You mention a queer meet up at a bar. The bar part is very alarming for a 13 yr old. If Alex does not identify as a straight female is that an issue with your parents? Is Alex rebelling from lack of support from your parents based on their gender or sexuality? Please be supportive of Alex if that is going on. 

Alex is at a very hard age. I think many kids just sort of going a bit crazy in all kinds of ways from like 11-14. Hormones, trying to figure out who you want to be. Still being a kid but feeling more like an adult. It is just not a great time for many of us at that age. So even if it was easier for you please give Alex some empathy. 

Now my opinion your parents are not giving Alex consequences. Not knowing where they are, breaking curfew, going to a bar, stealing I would not be allowing her a screen to use for anything but homework. There would not be anytime to be gone. Grounded for months at that point. At the very least no going out. If they are allowing friends hanging out then I would make it happen at home. But you can’t do any of this. It is up to your parents. I also say all of that assuming there isn’t way more to the story.

1kpay43,msyhiz0,rabidcfish32,"My kid has inattentive type ADHD, autism, and anxiety. At 6, we started medication. My husband was very against it. She was so tiny. I took him to a parent meeting with our pediatrician because he had more trust in that doctor than in the psychiatrist that had seen our kid once. 

Our pediatrician gave him medical studies on treating adhd and addiction. I wish I kept those in a file. So unfortunately please ask your own doctor for help finding valid studies. But the gist was the drugs often used to treat ADHD do actual change the brain. Very scary. But the younger you start medication the less likelihood of needing it into adulthood. The changes in the brain help kids with their executive functioning permanently. The studies show that kids that are medicated for ADHD have lower risk of drug and alcohol addiction. That sold my husband. 

However we have spend a year of finding the right medications and combos of medications for my 6 now 7 year old. There have been many times we thought we wanted to stop and would just homeschool her. She had meds that made her like a zombie, that made her more irritable, messed with her sleep, she lost 4 pounds in 2 months then gained 8 in two months. Which is a lot when you are 6. The constipation issues were a nightmare. This was really rough. We now have finally found the right combination. In part it took so long because her psychiatrist started with tiny doses and we intentionally went slow because we are talking about a little body and brain under 50 pounds. But the difference the right medications have been on my kid is a very happy little human. Her confidence is so improved. She is back to loving school. She wants to play with other kids again. It has been magic.

as your husband thinks, yes it is correct. it becomes dangerous if it is not used correctly. instead of giving him medicine that actually turned him into a zombie, they figured out what would naturally stimulate his mind without the use of a medicine that would literally shut him down. my brother LOVED taking things apart and out it back together. they bought him old radios, old bikes, and bought him all the tools he would need to do exactly what he wanted with them. he would even combine everything together with components of each item to create something he found interesting. 

my brother is now a successful lance corporal in the marines, working as a mechanic.

i do not know you enough to know, but i believe that the reason why you struggled so much growing up is because your mother tried to protect you from the medication, but didn't know exactly how to help you without the use of it. 

i don't think that your perception of using the medication to ""help your daughter"" is worth ruining the relationship of you and your husband. if my partner gave my child something that i was uncomfortable with her using, i would feel betrayed and would no longer trust my partner. there's plenty of ways that you can stimulate her mind without the use of a medicine that will literally turn her into a person that she is not.

I would plan some time alone with your mum, at home maybe, not in a public place and make sure nobody else will be around. Maybe make some lunch for her or get some coffee & cake on the go and raise it very gently. 

I would focus on your tone and sincerity and just say “mum, this is really really hard for me to bring up and say out loud, but grandma recently divulged some information to me that I can’t move past without talking to you about it”. Ask her not to get angry or upset with you and try to speak to you about it as though you are her closest friend and not her daughter. Say you feel strong enough to know the truth and you want to support her because you now feel some shared pain over it and you feel protective and don’t want her to be alone with what’s happened. 

I would also say to her that it is entirely her choice as to whether she raises it with your grandparents, but that you will never relay to them that you have spoken about it if she wishes for you not to. 

Maybe your mum financially relying on them is her way of bleeding them dry for the damage they have done! And fair play to her if so. Give her big hugs and tell her that he will get his karma one day! 

I can’t believe your grandma is so cool about it, whatever it is. The fact she’s mentioned it to you tells me she struggles with it in some weird way too, like she needs it off her chest or she’s looking for someone stronger to resent him? 

My grandma did this after my grandad died… told me about all of his misgivings, affairs and abusive behaviour towards her when they were younger and his narcissistic control. It’s like she wanted to feel vindicated in her feelings towards him.

1. You’re 19, so consider moving out. Perhaps there are some friends you can stay with for a while. You’re an adult and should strive for independence if you can. You may need to go part time at school so you can work more to pay rent

2. Be super apologetic, and promise them you won’t do it again. And stop doing it until you move out.

4. Try to come to some kind of agreement with your parents. Something like accountability system where they are allowed to monitor you in some way. It’s not a great way to live but it’s better than alternative.

4. Be super honest with your parents about your intentions. “You can move to the country if you want, but that isn’t going to stop me smoking weed. I don’t smoke it everyday, I don’t plan to, but I also don’t plan to stop it”. Once they realize their grand plan won’t work, perhaps they won’t move.

When a parent cheats it feels wrong because even though they cheat on their partner, in my opinion they also cheat on the family. Family is trust, honesty, stability, safety and you may feel violated by your mom not respecting those values enough to put them first in the face of her marriage troubles. 

At the end of the day, your mom is just a human. She loves you very deeply. Try to think about THAT instead, when you think about what she did.

I can kinda get why you'd see a Mother not wanting a day *Being* a Mother as being confusing because it's not a ""Direct Celebration Of Her Motherhood"" - however you've gotta understand that from *Her* perspective she's being a Mother *Constantly* like 100% *All Day Every Day* and actually there *is* no ""Day Off"" she can really take from that. 

I get that you're working, a ***Lot*** , in order to bring in money and provide for the house, the bills, fun money, all that stuff, and 12 hours a day 6 days a week is a ***Lot*** of work and a lot of responsibility to bear.

So, your wife sees that, and understands that, however it means she's left with the House and the Kids, and those responsibilities, the physical and emotional burden of childrearing and household management - which are full-on, always-there responsibilities that she's always faced with. Does she do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, playtime, etc? Does she maintain your standard of living at home? Those things all take effort and are often ""Hidden"" to folks that don't want to see them.

Mate, if you're working so much, she's doing a *lot* that you're probably not appreciating or seeing. She'd probably like a ""Day Off"" from that and I am absolutely certain that she'd absolutely *Love* for you to spend a full day in *her* shoes, looking after the kids, planning a fun day with them, and then *tidying up afterwards and doing the washing up* so she can come home to a clean tidy house to happy kids and a spouse who has some more empathy for her.",2,1747339230.0

I can kinda get why you'd see a Mother not wanting a day *Being* a Mother as being confusing because it's not a ""Direct Celebration Of Her Motherhood"" - however you've gotta understand that from *Her* perspective she's being a Mother *Constantly* like 100% *All Day Every Day* and actually there *is* no ""Day Off"" she can really take from that. 

I get that you're working, a ***Lot*** , in order to bring in money and provide for the house, the bills, fun money, all that stuff, and 12 hours a day 6 days a week is a ***Lot*** of work and a lot of responsibility to bear.

So, your wife sees that, and understands that, however it means she's left with the House and the Kids, and those responsibilities, the physical and emotional burden of childrearing and household management - which are full-on, always-there responsibilities that she's always faced with. Does she do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, playtime, etc? Does she maintain your standard of living at home? Those things all take effort and are often ""Hidden"" to folks that don't want to see them.

Mate, if you're working so much, she's doing a *lot* that you're probably not appreciating or seeing. She'd probably like a ""Day Off"" from that and I am absolutely certain that she'd absolutely *Love* for you to spend a full day in *her* shoes, looking after the kids, planning a fun day with them, and then *tidying up afterwards and doing the washing up* so she can come home to a clean tidy house to happy kids and a spouse who has some more empathy for her.",2,1747339230.0

It’s not possible to not be needed to do something for the kids, around the kids. She will have to do mothering. Like someone rise mentioned.

Does she do the cooking, cleaning, laundry, playtime, etc? Does she maintain your standard of living at home? Those things all take effort and are often ""Hidden"" to folks that don't want to see them.

Mate, if you're working so much, she's doing a *lot* that you're probably not appreciating or seeing. She'd probably like a ""Day Off"" from that and I am absolutely certain that she'd absolutely *Love* for you to spend a full day in *her* shoes, looking after the kids, planning a fun day with them, and then *tidying up afterwards and doing the washing up* so she can come home to a clean tidy house to happy kids and a spouse who has some more empathy for her.",2,1747339230.0

In situations like these, it’s essential to balance love and compassion with wisdom and discernment. While it’s natural to want to help our loved ones, it’s also important to recognize when our assistance might be enabling patterns that are not beneficial in the long run.

From a spiritual perspective, we are encouraged to be supportive and kind, but also to set healthy boundaries. Encouraging your sister to seek professional help for herself and her children could be a constructive step. Therapy or counseling might provide them with the tools to heal and develop healthier family dynamics.

Additionally, maintaining open and honest communication with your sister about your concerns, while expressing your love and support, could help her understand the impact of her actions on her children and your family.

Remember to take care of your own emotional well-being as well. Supporting someone through such challenges can be draining, and it’s important to ensure you’re also receiving the support you need.",1,1747306893.0

Even though we didn’t look alike, people used to treat me and my sister with the stereotype that we were supposed to be on the same wavelength at all times. We were night and day in every regards. 

Your brother sounds more like a confident extrovert. You sound like a shy introvert. 

In this case your brother is doing typical teen boy behavior and is also distinguishing himself from you, which is also an individual thing. He has his own individuality, his own personality, and is not a mind reader. You didn’t let him know you liked a girl, and also downplayed your attraction to her. You can’t say you’re platonic friends in one breath and then retroactively switch it around saying they both betrayed you when nobody knew you liked the girl in the first place. There is no such thing as unspoken rules. You should have voiced up and chose not to, and now you’re frustrated and blaming those around you for not understanding when it was you who never informed anyone. It is your responsibility to manage your time and relationships with people and it is your responsibility to vocalize how you feel instead of leaving people to guess or assume.  Don’t blame your brother for being who he is, and dont blame your female friends (or any friends for that matter) for being closer to someone else when you’re not putting forth enough effort to be more social and bond with people.",2,1747067117.0

1kk05n4,mrqzj6d,Antique_Display282,"I’m sorry you’re going through this. It’s one thing to experience bullying; but when it’s in one’s own home it is unacceptable. There you should feel supported, loved, seen and heard by every family member. You should be incredibly proud everything you’re working towards and have already accomplished. That said, if it were me (and my school offered it) I would take college credit classes that would get me closer to an early graduation, and (yes) perhaps farther from your toxic home environment. 

I would strongly consider reaching out to your school’s guidance counselor to see if they can help you with other practical things to bridge the gap in the meantime. It would be confidential and free. The counselors are bound by a strict code of ethics, and you can speak with one without the fear of them going to your parents or anyone (unless you authorize it, or they felt you were in danger of harm, etc.) 

Because you sound very busy academically / extracurricularly it might be something you could do during lunch breaks or between classes. Just a thought. I hope it’s helpful. 

I’m much older than you but my relationship with my younger sister I’ve discovering recently has deteriorated similarly. She suffers mental illness, but like our mother has no interest in self-care, self-awareness, self-improvement or even basic kindness. She chooses to put energy (quite a lot apparently) into hating me (and my children.) I choose to put my focus squarely on my own life, and the things that I’m grateful for and the people that I love, who love me back. Not all family is related by blood. Some families are created.

First off, although I don't know your family or your mom, its concerning that she would suddenly stop caring. I think she may be showing signs of depression. when depression begins, so does the will to stop caring for those around you. and normally, those individuals are more susceptible to manipulation.

and you know what trump likes, right? being able to manipulate the population and have devoted followers. this is why many people consider the far right a cultish agenda. 

i believe your mom may have fallen into this circle, and found a place where she is comfortable after not having one. therefore, she goes around all preechy like. 

my advice? don't do anything. parents (and especially trump supports) have this severe god complex that makes them incapable of considering other peoples opinions. you'll just be wasting your time trying to explain to her how you think, when she's tuned you out. 

however, i do recommend you spend more time with your mom, even if it may be painful. clean up around the house (aka, clean the kitchen one day), or offer to take her shopping or whatever she might enjoy doing. that is, if you wish to help her.

1ki4i8f,mrc4sfj,Murderino67,"OP, I have been in your situation before, my uncle lived with us when I was your age. Only, my uncle would take about 5 Xanax at a time and pass out. Once he passed out in the bathroom floor and I couldn’t get the door open and I didn’t know if he was even alive.  It was very scary and I was alone with him while my mom was out of town working during the week!  I never had issue with doing the housework because I knew my mom worked and my uncle was just unavailable, but I got through it. My uncle got brain cancer a few years later and took his own life so he wouldn’t be a burden on his siblings, as his kids were a bit younger than I was. 
These issues of you having to clean up after him isn’t really fair to you, and it’s your moms place to talk to him about the bathroom when he uses it and if he dirties up the kitchen unless it’s a shared meal. When we all ate together I just knew the responsibility fell on my brother and me to clean up afterwards. We were kids and had chores. Hopefully you realize that these are expectations because it’s part of learning how to be independent and be able to clean your own home one day. My kids (6 girls and several foster children) aaaaaalllllll hated the chore list and didn’t think it was fair to do all the dishes ( and we were a big family who didn’t use paper plates and I cooked every meal). But, they are all very clean housekeepers and tell me how glad they are that I taught them to clean the fridge out every week and wipe everything down in there. I know it may seem overwhelming, but if it’s just the three of you, and the only complaint is dishes and bathroom, that’s pretty easy, actually. Also, dishes are much easier to stay on top of if they are done every day, at least once a day. My motto was “when I wake up to make coffee, there better not be any dishes in the sink or on the counters.”  I didn’t care if they were left until right before bedtime, but no later. Good luck, OP. Just remember that your mom needs to ask your uncle to clean up his bathroom and kitchen messes unless they are meals y’all eat together. 💜

Edit to add:  when you work the night shift, sometimes when you come home it’s hard to just go straight to bed and go to sleep. I worked nights for years and got off work and home about 11:30pm and would catch up on my missed tv shows until 1:30-2:30 am before I could keep the wheels from spinning in my brain and wind down from working 10 hours. This is normal.",1,1746748722.0
1ki4i8f,mrcwh7s,Hunny-Kace,"Thanks for taking the time to share your story—I’m really sorry for everything you went through, that sounds incredibly hard. I totally understand that everyone has different experiences and expectations when it comes to chores and family, but I think my situation is a bit different.

I don’t mind doing chores or helping around the house. I know that’s part of growing up. But what’s bothering me is that I’m the one constantly cleaning up messes I didn’t make, while my uncle—who’s a full-grown adult—doesn’t seem to clean up after himself at all. It’s not about avoiding responsibility, it’s about feeling like I’m being taken advantage of and expected to do things just because I’m “the kid.”

I’ve seen my uncle stay up gaming for hours before going to bed, so while I do understand night shift can mess with your schedule, it’s hard not to feel frustrated when he doesn’t seem too tired for that.

I’m just trying to figure out how to talk to my mom about it without upsetting her. I don’t think it’s fair that she’s the only one who can say something, and I’m stuck just dealing with it in silence.

1khk70c,mrbad98,IcyDream4100,"As someone who's grown up with a brother who was also abusive to me and is ""getting better,"" they don't actually get better. 

From the ages of 9-14 (that I remember), it was physical and intimate abuse. Now, he is a legal adult with a job. He will buy me things if I ask, try to hang out with me (too much. He gets mad if I ask for time alone, similar to your brother overstepping boundaries). 

It typically is an attempt for them to be better because they know what a dick they are, but unfortunately, if you have to TRY and be a good person, you will fail. They genuinely do not know how to be thoughtful of you. If they buy you things, they EXPECT something in return even if thats just your relationship improving. If they are suddenly shoving themselves in your life its not because they care for what you are dealing with, its because they are bored or want to know all that is happening. They don't deserve to know what is going on in your life when abusers are the main reason people develop mental problems and other issues IMPACTING your life. 

It causes stress on them because they KNOW that they have done you wrong. Instead of trying to be better to repair what was broken, they try and be better for the selfish reason of bringing them peace and allowing themselves to think, ""im a good person."" 

In the end, it is your brother. I do not know your family dynamic, and while our situations may be similar, they are not exact. If you truly feel that he is trying to fix the past and you want a better relationship with him you can try. But never think that they are owed your forgiveness for the pain they've put on you just because they do a few nice things now. Don't let family pressure you saying, ""He is different now."".

At first I thought it was a friend or partner, then thought it was your parent and was really shocked but your post says it’s your aunt? Please can you clear this up for me? 

Moving on, I can 1000% see why this would still be lingering in your head after a month. I’m really sorry you were in this situation. 

To be clear, you were calm and clear over text [can’t speak for anything else obviously] and the other person was so rude, aggressive and essentially shouting at you with their text messages. 

I can’t see what you’ve done wrong here, at all. So what if you didn’t message for 3 weeks - they didn’t either. Obviously they are the older adult here and should realistically be setting an example for you as a young adult. 

I can understand being overwhelmed and concentrating on your own life, work, school and health is a lot to balance. Please do NOT be hard on yourself about this at all. 

If it makes you feel a tad better, I recently found out about my ADHD/AU [waiting for professional diagnosis] and things with my parents became very tense. I needed time to process things, how life could have been different if I knew at 5 or 10 instead of 23. How did no one realise? All sorts of things I needed to process. But they couldn’t give me that, they pushed and hounded me to talk to them. They’d say anything they needed to guilt me into talking to them so I ignored them for 3 months nearly. All I needed was respected space without the guilt.

Speak with your mother let her know that you'd like to go and eat dinner with her. Just the two of you together 1 on 1. During the dinner you can express your feelings in regards to how you feel about the current state of the relationship. Here's the key. This conversation needs ti be an equal exchange you need to listen to understand not just respond. Moving forward you and your mother may need to make this a weekly practice to ensure the security of this relationship going forward. It's all about communication. Then you continue to build from there.",1,1746723175.0

She stole what was left of your parents, and if anyone tries to call you out ask them if they have plans to steal from family as well.

The notary deserves to lose their job if the fraud is proven, because gosh only knows how many times that person got away with doing such a thing. As far as your sister, what she did and is doing isn't uncommon. Greedy an scheming family members pull that stunt with elderly in their waning times to manipulate getting everything they can. Seriously look into the atrocities that happen in nursing homes and feuding families. If you're weak and doped up on meds or having a lapse due to Alzheimer's they can make you sign all sorts of things, or straight up forge your signature and most people have no means of fighting the expensive legal battles.

To be clear — you are not tearing the family apart. She is. [read that as many times as you need]. 

You must MUST must pursue the charge. For your parents and for yourself. What she did was wrong. So very wrong, selfish and twisted some might say. What other people think is none of your business, so do not worry about it dear. Please. 

You have the evidence you need so roll with it and whatever happens, happens. 

I have a similar situation but very different. It was between deciding to report or not to report a family member for [a-salt]. For 18 months I decided not to until I was driving and crying and before I knew it I was calling the police. It took me 18 months because I didn’t want to be the one to tear the family apart. Would you tell me that I would be tearing my family apart for reporting them? I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t. So the same applies for you OP. You did nothing wrong, you are not tearing the family apart. 

I do warn you that you may lose some family members though, because I sure as hell have. I wish you all the best with this",2,1746710290.0

For the past decade, my sister has disowned me multiple times, and both she and my brother have cut off contact ever since I began advocating for my father in the hospital and nursing home. They witnessed his decline and the neglect he suffered—and still chose to stand together in silence.

It’s painful, but not surprising. My sister has treated me with resentment since we were young. She’s made my life incredibly difficult, and this situation only revealed more of that. On the day my father passed, she didn’t show up to the nursing home. It was her day to spend the night at the nursing home—she sent a sitter instead. She even threatened to have me removed from the nursing home by calling the facility and instructing them to call PD. 

I made a promise to my parents that they would never be alone, and I kept that promise. On the day of my fathers mass and the day of his funeral neither of them showed up nor did their families. 

So, no—I don’t miss them. That may sound harsh, but I’ve accepted that I don’t need people in my life who can be so horrible in the face of such deep loss. After reading so many comments and advice, I know what to do now. Thank you for being a part of that!",1,1746820911.0

Personally in moments like that I try to rationalise as best I can, tell myself this thought is only reoccurring because of habit and just try sit with it and keep reaffirming that. I would suggest seeing a therapist as cliché as it sounds talking about it can often help because it then has more of a logical explanation, and it is no longer some deep dark secret you have to keep in your head.

I am my father’s only child. I have a sister who’s my half sister (she’s older) that my dad loved and helped raised and always swore he’d adopt. However when he met my now step mom when I was 12 all that changed. My stepmother and my dad’s mom did butt heads and never quite got along. But my dad honestly traded families. He wrote ours off. My stepmother is evil and conniving and controlling and manipulative. Which caused me to get emancipated my senior year. 

However after high school I did everything in my power to repair my relationship with my dad. I called regularly. I asked about her and her family. I sent birthday gifts and Christmas gifts and never missed a Father’s Day card. Come around to my wedding. I begged and begged him to come. He lives in California and we got married in Washington. He kept saying he couldn’t confirm because his wife’s daughter was due with her first child around the same time. My sister drove to his house and berated him saying you can’t miss your only daughter’s wedding! 

Well guess what? He came…. And immediately following the ceremony his wife rushed me making all these excuses saying it wasn’t her. She would’ve made him come regardless…. 

All this truly just to say it wasn’t worth it. They ate our food (for everyone) immediately following the ceremony and then they left. Without a word. Left me standing there for the father daughter dance searching. My uncle ran up and saved the day. That was September 10 2017. And I haven’t heard from him since. 

I only wrote all this to say “if he wanted to he would”. We can’t force them to love us. Or to want to be included and involved. I’m really sorry. I know more than anyone how painful it is. So I truly wish you the best. Put your great family and new family first. And let them go. ☮️",1,1746551916.0

""It sounds like you're in an incredibly tough situation, caught between the person you love and your difficult relationship with your mother. It's completely understandable that you're feeling sick and anxious. Let's break this down and see if we can find some paths forward.



How to Prove Yourself to Your Fiancé:
Your fiancé's request isn't unreasonable. He needs to see concrete actions that demonstrate your commitment to him and your willingness to prioritize your relationship.


 Here's what you can do:
 * Have an honest and direct conversation with him: Acknowledge his feelings of resentment and hurt. Validate his perspective and let him know you understand why he feels the way he does. Don't make excuses for your mother's behavior. Focus on how you will change moving forward.



 * Set clear boundaries with your mother and communicate them to your fiancé: This is the most crucial step. You need to clearly and firmly tell your mother that her behavior towards your fiancé and your relationship is unacceptable and will no longer be tolerated. Provide specific examples of what you won't accept (e.g., negative comments about him, attempts to control wedding plans, questioning your life choices). 


Let your fiancé know exactly what you said and what the consequences will be if she crosses those boundaries (e.g., ending a conversation, taking a break from contact).


 * Involve your fiancé in decisions about your mother: Before discussing anything significant about your relationship or wedding with your mother, talk to your fiancé first. Make decisions together about how you will handle her interference. This shows him that he is your priority and that you value his input.



 * Present a united front: When interacting with your mother, ensure your fiancé is present (if appropriate and if he's willing) and that you back each other up. If she starts making negative comments, politely but firmly shut them down together.


 * Be consistent: Setting boundaries is only effective if you consistently enforce them. If your mother crosses a line, follow through with the consequences you established. This will show your fiancé that you are serious about protecting your relationship.



 * Seek professional help (individually and/or as a couple): A therapist can provide you with tools and strategies for setting boundaries, communicating effectively, and processing the complex emotions involved in this situation. Couples counseling can help you and your fiancé navigate the challenges and strengthen your bond.



How to Stick Up to Your Mother:
This will likely be the most challenging part, especially given your history. Here are some strategies:
 * Choose your battles: You don't have to respond to every negative comment. Decide what is truly important to address and let the smaller things slide.
.

 * Use ""I"" statements: Focus on how her behavior makes you feel, rather than accusing her. For example, instead of saying ""You're always criticizing my fiancé,"" try ""I feel hurt and disrespected when you say negative things about [fiancé's name].""


 * Be direct and assertive: Clearly state your boundaries and expectations. Avoid vague language or hoping she'll ""get the hint.""



 * Stay calm: It's easy to get drawn into an emotional argument with someone who may have personality disorder traits. Try to remain calm and stick to your points. If she becomes overly aggressive or abusive, end the conversation.
.

 * Don't JADE (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain): You don't need to justify your choices or defend your fiancé. Simply state your position and leave it at that. Engaging in lengthy explanations often gives her more ammunition to argue.


 * Accept that you can't control her reactions: You can only control your own behavior. She may still be angry or upset, and that's okay. Your priority is protecting yourself and your relationship.



 * Consider limiting contact: If her behavior continues to be toxic and damaging to your well-being and your relationship, you may need to consider reducing the frequency or nature of your contact with her. This is a difficult decision, but sometimes necessary for self-preservation.



How to Put Your Relationship First While Still Keeping a Relationship with Her:
This is the tightrope walk you're on. It's important to understand that you may not be able to have the kind of relationship with your mother that you might have hoped for. 



Here's how to prioritize your fiancé while still attempting a connection with your mom:
 * Your fiancé is your primary family now: Recognize that your commitment is now to your fiancé and your future together. His needs and feelings should take precedence over your mother's desires and criticisms.



 * Compartmentalize: Try to keep interactions with your mother focused on neutral topics when possible. Avoid discussing your fiancé or wedding plans in detail if you know it will lead to conflict.


 * Involve your fiancé in decisions about your mother (as mentioned before): This reinforces that you are a team.
 * Seek support from your in-laws: Lean on your fiancé's family for emotional support and understanding. Your MIL seems like a wonderful ally.



 * Be realistic about expectations: Your mother may never fully approve of your fiancé or your choices. Accept this possibility and focus on building a strong and happy life with him regardless.



Can You Salvage a Relationship with Both of Them?
It's possible, but it will depend heavily on your mother's willingness to respect your boundaries and your relationship. If she continues to be critical and controlling, maintaining a close and healthy relationship with both may be impossible. 


You may need to accept a more distant relationship with your mother for the sake of your own well-being and the health of your marriage.


Regarding Your Mother's Sacrifices:
It's important to acknowledge the sacrifices your mother made!


Especially after your father left. However (!) those sacrifices do not give her the right to control your life or treat your partner with disrespect. You can be grateful for what she did while still setting boundaries and prioritizing your own happiness!



This is a painful situation, and it's okay to feel the emotions you're experiencing. Remember that you deserve to be in a loving and supportive relationship, and you have the right to protect that relationship. 


Take things one step at a time, focus on clear communication and consistent boundaries, and don't hesitate to seek professional support. 


You and your fiancé deserve happiness.""",6,1746540472.0

1kfy4kd,mr4z8uc,Top-End-6710,"You love your fiancé, right?! Better yet do you love yourself? If you do then, give yourself this gift of happiness. Be there for your fiancé. He’s your ride or die. Do you plan on building a life with your fiancé or your mother? I definitely think you need to put your wedding on pause until your 

Yes she’s done a lot for you throughout your life. Unfortunately for you, I guarantee she’s weaponized all that she’s done for you throughout your life. Whether you realize it or not. I bet she constantly brings up what she’s done for you and how you’re so ungrateful. 

Sadly every single thing she ever did for you or bought you; now comes with a price tag. Remind her, that’s the responsibility she took on once you came into the world. Let your mom know that she no longer gets a say in your life or its direction. 

It’s time to establish some serious boundaries and hold firm to them. 

I would suggest that you and your fiancé need to read up on how to handle a narcissistic MIL. Just by what you’ve described, it definitely sounds as if your mom is undiagnosed with comorbid disorders. 

Also you should read up on DARVO tactics, gaslighting, psychological projection, manipulation and emotional exploitation. I would recommend reading up on how to properly communicate with your mother and not allow her to activate you both by provoking a fight. That’s what narcissist have a tendency to try and trigger you. That way, once you begin getting heated and argue back. Then she feels justified in how she responds to you. 

Remember respond decisively to narcissistic accusations by asserting your truth with clarity and conviction. Use concise, direct language to refute false claims, leaving no room for misinterpretation. For example, if accused of dishonesty, state unequivocally “That statement is incorrect.”

Good luck and remember, you are not responsible for your mother’s happiness, behavior and you most certainly are not her retirement. If you’re a parent and you have children and view them as such, don’t be surprised when you end up in a home. As a parent, the only expectation you should have your children is that they have a happy life. If you give your kids the best life possible, make silent sacrifices for them. Put their wants/ needs first and make them your top priority. That way if you need help later on in life, they’ll wanna take care of you. They won’t feel obligated.",1,1746653077.0

Does this mean is he a drunk, is he sleazy, , does he treat people with respect, is he faithful to you, is he a lawbreaker, does he have a job?

1kfbfse,mqtfgzd,Amie-Grace7,"I'll be honest - based on what you have said here, it does sound like your mom is being a little extra, but it is really hard to say without hearing the other side of the story. I know I wasn't a perfect mom either, and my daughter could have written something very similar from her perspective when she and I were in a rough patch in our relationship. I know I wasn't trying to be a hag, but looking back, I definitely had my moments. 

Since you are 17, what occurs to me is that you and your mom may just be in that tenuous timeframe where she and you are trying to realign your relationship from parent-child to parent-peer. That is a hard adjustment for both of you! It can cause some strain as you test your boundaries and she gets used to the idea that you are becoming independent. You are going to be 18 within a year, which means legally you can start making some of your own decisions. Keep in mind that unless you can fully support yourself financially though, you are still bound to your parent's rules, so don't try brandishing that as a weapon, because it could backfire on you pretty quickly! 

It also sounds like there could be some miscommunication or misunderstanding between you two. It is ok to clarify that you thought you were helping by cleaning up, and that it hurt your feelings when she said you ruined their progress. When my daughter got to the point where she felt I was giving her whiplash, she finally let me know. Have you tried being honest with your mom about exactly how you feel? I don't know your mom well enough to know how well that would go over, but when my daughter told me I took the fun out of everything, deep down in my heart I knew she was right. I was moody and could go from happy to angry in a millisecond if something went wrong. It wasn't the person I wanted to be, it was just all I knew at that time. Her pointing out to me that it was damaging our relationship was the motivation I needed to work on myself to try and stop being so reactive. 

As you get more independent, you are going to have a choice about how much time you spend with your mom, depending on how you feel when you are with her. Do what you need to do to be mentally healthy, but if you think she has the capacity to consider how she is impacting others, give her a chance to know what she can work on within herself to make your relationship mutually enjoyable.

1kf03b8,mqpbajw,Far_Promise_9903,"Man. It’s tough. Im not going to pretend like im a parent or have dealt with that situation before. So my points may not be as backed up. 

Have you tried having a conversation with her about how you felt? How frustrated you are and thinking about sending her back because of all of that? 

In addition to how she is doing? Personally as a human? 

I think at 18 (yes, as an adult we see her as someone who needs to get a life and contribute to society, as all adults do) it’s really hard for them especially since she probably hasnt found her place as a older teen/young adult in canada yet and her identity and it can be very hard on her, which ultimately makes it extremely hard on you and the people around you. 

If she can engage in things she enjoys such as sports, social time, games, etc  it may help her engage her more and over better her mental and physical wellness. Which will make it more possible for her to see and reflect on her own shortcoming and want to better herself. Its tough to motivate a 18 year old if they havent been engage themselves in any particular thing. 

In a way i came from Vietnamese immigrant and parenting was very straight and brute-like and chaotic. It took me awhile to learn to grow up and not be as co-dependent on parents or siblings and learning more about who i was, the trauma, my identity, what i like or dislike and being aware of learning to cop better and reconditioning my habits and understanding of the world really made me engage more with life to try better my circumstances. 

What also helped was that my older sister, at times would give me “lectures” or tell me stories of the challenges that my parents and my older siblings faced and share wisdom with me. Obviously at the time i hated it. But when i was left alone or quiet, and older experiencing the same challenges, it really made me think about it and sit and mature on it more. 


Regardless, i know its hard work parenting, nonetheless babysitting your sibling cause you care. Its even harder to be patient and have foresight about their own lives and having to be responsible for them is quite frustrating. Itll take work and sometimes things may turn out worse or better and maybe she will have to go back home. But as long as she has the opportunity to learn. Even if its hard reality, its sometimes needed to wake them up. Maybe starting the conversation about your frustration and your thoughts about sending her back and having a heart to heart. Can start a conversation about both of your lives individually and together. 

But i wish you good luck and i hope everything turns out better for you and your family. It’s not easy as newcomers to a new country. Just think of it more as a selfless act of love. Love is the hardest thing when youre angry or frustrated. 


What helped me personally was learning to meditate and work on compassion. As woowoo as that sounds it helps. Not saying i dont get angry or feel emotions but it helps reduce the impulsiveness to attach to negative emotions and you become bit more aware of everything. 

I recommend taking time for yourself and getting mindful about your own stresses and becoming aware of it. And letting it pass without holding onto any particular feelings about it. Noticing it. 


Highly recommend Mindfulness practice (only thing you can control is your own awareness and presence)",3,1746451282.0

Why didn’t the 3 of you discuss rules and expectations for her to be able to live with you in advance? Hopefully you realize that is where you messed up in this equation. Everything should’ve been conveyed to and understood by your sister and her mom, long before she showed up. 

Along with any consequences/repercussions for disrespecting and ignoring what was expected. I would’ve had her sign some type of agreement, a lease if you will. She might’ve been pissed about it, but that’s how adulthood works. 

What gets me is her mom’s response when you came to her for advice. It is very telling and a big red flag about her parenting style. It sounds as if your sister had no structure back home and was allowed too much freedom. Her mom seemed to have too much of a laissez-faire parenting style. This is where mom let the side down, for everyone! 

You definitely need to have a zoom call with the 3 of you. To finally hash out all your grievances and what must happen if you decide to let her stay. If you can have another person present, possibly record what is said, so no one can play victim. That way mom and sis can’t try to rewrite history and paint you as the villain to others. 

I would try not to be so hard on your sister and give her grace where you can. Just a thought, has anyone ever considered she might be having some type of undiagnosed mental health challenges, possibly seasonal depression? Trust me, depression can ruin lives and make everything feel impossible to do.

Has your sister ever lived outside of your home country before, away from your parents?! Maybe take into consideration that adjusting to a new environment also involves a psychological adaptation. Since you have to learn the routines, social norms, and cultural nuances of your new location. Think back to when you came to Canada and all the challenges that you faced. It probably would’ve been nice to have someone helping you find your way. 

Suddenly going from the D.R. to Canada, holy crumbs that had to be an extreme culture shock. Have you ever considered asking your sister how she’s doing or what she’s struggling with. I’m not asking you to parent her, I am asking you to have a sincere conversation and relate to her. 

Let her know what it was like for you stepping out on your own and how you were able to navigate pre-adulthood. Don’t put the stress of feeling/thinking you have to parent your sister. Instead think of it as if you’re a teacher in “her village” that can pass down your own experiences and lessons to help her throughout life. 

Remember, parenting encompasses the broader, holistic care and development of a child, including emotional, social, and practical skills, within the family context. 

Teaching, on the other hand, focuses on the systematic imparting of knowledge and skills in a structured environment. Maybe you could be that structure that could make a difference where others have failed your sister.",1,1746484891.0

You wash your own clothes or you do not have clean clothes would work unless they are ok being stinky. Do they do any after school activities? Too bad you can’t go to dance you didn’t wash your clothes. 

Trash hasn’t been taken out. Too bad no WiFi. Didn’t clean up your room, no iPad or video games. 

Now I was never taught to do any chores as a kid. My mom assumed it was all common sense and I should just know it at a certain point. Laundry I picked up on well enough but not to her standard. Her clothes sorting is beyond just colors. So keep the chores simple. 

My 7 yr old has adhd. She can handle small tasks but needs me to be in the room with her to do them. Annoying. But it is where we are at. Laundry all goes on cold and I do not have her sort colors out for her clothes. She can put it in the wash and then the dryer by herself now. No where close for her learning hanging and folding. But to clean up her room and toys it is me telling her just do this small section. Then another. I stay in the room or go in and out with lots of reminders. Annoying but it is where she is at learning executive functioning. 

Little kids might get excited about being helpers but it does not last. I do not know anyone that happily does chores. I complain about laundry and dishes. So I recommend for your sanity let them complain. Ignore it. But hold to the consequences. 

I also try myself really hard to not complain in front of my kid about my chores. She is little so if your kids are older I am not suggesting this. But I don’t complain because I don’t want her to see it as something dreadful. I want her to see it is apart of how we live daily. Music on when I do dishes. I recommend she plays her favorite song when she cleans her room. Or Hersheys kiss after her laundry is in the wash. Something to make it more treat than torture. 

Your husband needs to step up and take over with getting the kids to help around the house. He needs therapy for his addictions. Or family therapy for all of you.

A temporary ex parte can be issued without notice to the other party if there is an immediate threat of violence. Likewise an order of protection typically when law enforcement is involved and victims need immediate protection. So your best bet is contacting authorities to check the validity of her claims. It could be a manipulative tactic. And sometimes courts fudge things up. It sounds way worse if she vaguely says “OP didn’t return the child and got arrested” vs “it was a past due traffic ticket”.

I’m so sorry for that,  childhoods should not look like yours. It only gets harder, 

My advice, stop helping mom. Ignore her. Do your school work. Get into college and escape all  this. 

I know college  isn’t for all. At least finish HS and get a job and get the hell out. Open a bank account so mom can’t get to $ and never give her a dime. 

Grandma is a bit harder but yes she’s enabling your mom too. It doesn’t matter how mom wants things to go, she needs help. But you’re right, she has to want it. And as far as I know, methadone is a DAILY thing. 

Mom could try Suboxone if it’s opiates she’s on.

Part-time, in a grocery store? Part-time like, I don't know, Day Care for babies, something like that so she can get out into the workforce and that, gives her some self-confidence.

My feeling is that your mother, now, at home with your father's daily drunken anger, has made her self-confidence sink deep deep down.

Hopefully, after getting a job and more self-confidence she might leave your father.

The therapy is definitely important, but what I want to ask is how much effort have you and your husband put into “dating” each other? Some couples stop romancing each other once they get married/have kids/other life events, and it hurts the relationship. Have you both tried to reignite what first drew you to each other?

Your husband does sound like he has an empathy problem, and that’s not good for you or the kids. And your combined family is a big one. Do you have any sitters? Do you have good friends you can count on to talk to or help?

It’s not great for the kids to be around parents that are constantly fighting, and your ex has already made things hard for you. The kids need love, calm and stability. As parents, whether you stay together or not, you need to be on the same page and act as a team here. 

Tell your husband that if you’re going to have a discussion, you need to both speak like calm, reasonable and respectful adults. Yelling doesn’t solve anything and makes you shut down. He needs to make the effort to cool down if he’s going to talk try communicating his frustrations.

I encourage you both to individually write down a list of the things you want and need from each other in your relationship. Then come together and talk about it. Are you on the same page? Are you both willing to work together as a team? Can this be salvaged?

Here’s the biggest thing - you both have the responsibility to not unload these pains on the kids. We’re not perfect, but the hardest thing for kids seeing parents fight is they often think it’s their fault.

I realized at a young age that my sexual history had nothing to do with how much I love myself, or how much God loves me. I still existed, so why not choose to exist joyfully and with gratitude that I could live another day to experience all of life’s bounty? I had to choose that I was worth at least that much.

Your sister has no teeth, and may not be able to afford new dentures, however, this can be easily solved by her buying a white mouthguard, like they have in various sports, she can wear a so-called denture gel in these, it is usually available in regular medical stores, so she can at least smile, and look as if she has teeth.

Secondly, you are not responsible for your sister's life or all her children, she can give her child up for adoption if she is not able to raise it.

1k7nio1,mp5y6mw,TheOnlyKirby90210,"My mom (69), my second mom (71), stepdad (deceased) and eldest sister (50) all hoard/hoarded. I’m 35 and vividly remember when I was very young our house was full of large black garbage bags if everything Mom refused to part with because it was attached to some sentimental memory, even if those things were broken and beyond repair. Second mom is your typical pack rat that rationalizes needed things, never using it, and stuff accumulates. Stepdad was a mechanic/handyman and never threw anything away he figured may be useful some day. Mom’s mess was indoors mostly, so stepdad’s hoard of cars, tools, parts and odds n ends took up the backyard. My sister is a mix between food hoarder, impulse spender, and wannabe pack rat. I say wannabe because I won’t enable her wastefulness every time she demands things she doesn’t need. There are some things she’s crammed into a closet to the point she can’t budge the sliding door with an out of sight out of mind mentality. It’s the same with the deep freezer. Lots of food she bought but for reasons won’t use unless she’s forced to. With the exception of junk food she stashed and eats in the regular. There have been pest problems with all of them periodically. 

What I can tell you from being exposed to hoarding most of my life (35f btw) is not to expect changes any time soon. They won’t make changes in what they’re doing unless forced and it’s not a permanent fix to just gut their stuff out. They’ll eventually find a reason to accumulate more. Afterwards there may be resentments because they’ve been forced to part with stuff they’ve become attached to.

Im not use to that. My family was always very private and mindful about changing diapers. Its not an experience we feel comfortable sharing in a public and communal space. To us, its like shitting in front of people. Also, its a vulnerable situation. My partner thinks like me and would rather it be done privately especially in a smaller home where smells travel quick.

So, im not confident in responding without overreaction.

After assessing and open communication. My partner and I decided to private message her. We gave her an option and guideline of when she visits theres a place she can go thats set up for diaper and dispose of diapers.

Not saying docs are always right, they are not. I once went in with what I thought was ringworm. I had been gardening a lot. It took me going to see another doc when I went to visit my mom , 5 states away. He knew it was ringworm on my knee (kneeling in dirt and mulch) immediately. Doctors in my state put me on a steroid cream that made it worse!!!! 

But I still think nearly any doc would be happy to bill your insurance and run the test. I didn’t have insurance for my ringworm so it was $400 total and that was prob 18 years ago.",2,1745323526.0

1k4xvn2,moizaj7,TheOnlyKirby90210,"After reading this post and skimming some of the comments I can point out a few areas where you are a detriment to yourself with trying to get a diagnosis: 

  
1) I'm not saying this is right by any means BUT going in to see a doctor and telling them what you think you have is a quick way to get your concerns dismissed. I don't know why, but there is a underlying arrogance with doctors. It is all too common when patients do their own research and approach doctors saying 'this is what i think I have' that they often find the door shut in their face for some reason (\*points to the case of the girl who had cancer and doctors turned her away for a year leading up to her death because she kept telling the doctors she was sure it was cancer\*) Basically fake ignorance. Stop mentioning you think it's scabies. Let them figure it out on their own with their testing. Again I'm not saying its right, I'm not saying it should be like this, but the people who know knows exactly what I'm talking about. Doctors don't like being told what it is that's wrong with you, and I can see why that is because there are a lot of frauds, hypochondriacs and addicts out there. But for your own piece of mind and getting a proper diagnosis avoid telling them  what you think it is. 

2) You're not being flexible enough. Being more comfortable doing this or that a certain way is not working in your favor...at the moment. If you're saying you're 100% sure it's scabies and that your family is infected, do a walk in or go an ER. Disease doesn't work on a schedule. Your scabies isn't going to say it'll cooperate on the day of your appointment. It's going to help with you documenting your symptoms when they're active, but how you're going about trying to be seen is not working. You have to look try other channels to get seen by a dermatologist.",1,1745367930.0

They have told me how it’s not possible because I don’t work in healthcare or do other stereotypical things where one could catch scabies. Well, it can happen to ANYONE. I never broke out in the all-consuming rash most patients get. Instead, my burrows on my hand and ankle vanished after like 4 months and ever since Feb ‘25, I’ve been getting roving hives that have been getting worse & worse. It feels like bad mosquito bites that show up in clusters. I got fed up, so I went back to the doctor again thinking they’d for sure examine those. After a few glances with magnifying glasses and me explaining the pics of burrows, I’m told the same stuff about dermatitis & dishydrotic eczema and that I should just live on Zyrtec every day for the “random” hives.

Especially since he has only known her for for 2 months now I honestly think the current amount of interaction you two have had would be perfectly normal.

The main reason you may not feel ready atm to connect with this woman is because you feel uncomfortable with the fact that this woman has so recently become a part of your dads life and now he's trying to make her a part of yours. I could understand that because of how short she has been in his life and with her age difference to yours you may not feel comfortable interacting with her as someone who you due to their age difference feel that they may not end up long term and so you do not want to make close or further connections?

I guess that gender and other things of the situation can kind of come in as a key part of this too.

\-----  
I, a 16M can kind of understand where you are coming from because my 40 year old (definitely not wealthy) dad has been married to a 23F for the last 3 years, but because I'd actually never seen my dad since I was 7 and hadn't ever met this very kind woman till this last year it was a different situation for me to get to know them. 

This is because of family issues, though it's been funny since after being around my dad for a week it felt like I'd lived with his for my whole life considering all the habits, tics, personality traits, and reactions we'd share that I'd noticed from the beginning (even though he'd barely been in my life since I was 5). It was also nice that his wife didn't try to force her role in as my mother, but instead tried to be a parent. Kinda sucks that I have all this family drama myself with my step mother being a better to me then my Biological, It was also nice finally living with a good male role model for once to (considering all my moms boyfriends)

Sorry if I included to much about myself I'm kinda tired (2am), and need to emotionally dump (so I do it on random people that probably don't want it, since I cant do it to my own immediate family unless its my bio dad that I am currently not allowed to talk to. WHoo)   Sorry",1,1745140784.0

1k2yk2i,mo2ijz5,Automatic_Ability_63,"Hope you know that your not crazy, especially since I can relate to the feelings you are describing. I don't know if it is cause I am a teen or haven't talked about the problem you mentioned that I can relate to in the same terms you have with my therapist so there more willing to discuss it with me being a 16M, but If you feel like talking more about this I'd be happy to trama dump on you myself.

From What I have understood myself is that due to me being extremely emotionally intelligent and being extremely Empathetic, as well as a few other things. I found myself as I grew up with my bio mom attending to her and other peoples emotions, through this I learned to see them and there emotions as worth more then myself and began to basically live for them. It got to a point that everything I would do and how I would react and such around everyone was to make those around me that I cared for even the slightest amount happy, and would beat myself with blunt force for when I made them upset (which I did a lot cause my moms BF doesn't like me).

But getting to the point. I found that to make people happy and act like I wasn't mad or upset at myself and my reality/live with my trama my reaction to any negative emotion was to blank/ disassociate, now this was different then most cause it would still allow me to function but not easily, I could get distracted easily and it gives me terrible headaches since it won't allow me to passively cope with my emotions so I am constantly blank and unstable. I have had this problem with my hedaches and such since before I was 11 but wasn't able to process it since I don't allow myself passively to cry or breakdown ( it literally hurts, even now as I write this (f###king headaches)) I gave my self till I was 21 to find my purpose to live or be happy in any sort living otherwise I'd kill myself because of how I felt when I was 8. didn't tell anyone this till this year.

I got so good at passively controlling my emotions and making myself think I was the problem even after my moms BF tried to kill me that for years I convinced my old therapist that all I had was some minor PTSD and depression with anxiety, even if inside I was constantly telling myself that it would be better if I just killed myself.

Last year when I was 15 it got to the point I was so exhausted constantly not just because of the insane amount of physical activities that I did and what not that I'd convinced myself that it wasn't worth it to live and I'd kill myself that summer after I'd made my piece with myself and spent some time with my dad and his wife who lived in another state, This would be the second time I'd see my dad since I was 7 that year.

The only reason that I'm here is because for some reason being with my dad who I relate to almost as if I grew up with him in my life (which I didn't) in another state made me feel free enough to break down to him, and he didn't judge me. It was like a flip was switched when I told texted my mom that I wouldn't be coming home, my headaches hadn't left me but I'd felt in that moment that I actually had the chance to live a different life to what I had been living in. I could try to be something new. But now I'm currently living with my mom again till the court date (and probably going to stay because of my education here is better then there.).

Even now actually talking to my therapist and promising him that I wouldn't take my own life or hurt myself like I used to it hurts and my headaches get worse cause I'm avoiding allowing myself to think about ending my life. But it's hard not to cause what do I have to live for other then other peoples approval.

Sorry this is so long but I ended up trauma dumping on you. I hope my relation to how you feel helps if any :(       If you need to talk more I'd be happy to, even call. It's 3am so I get needing to cry yourself to sleep since I have my own trauma that doesn't allow me to sleep or fell safe sleeping. I would hate for you to end your life without at least hopefully giving you someone to lend a shoulder even if I'm a 16 year old.",1,1745144357.0

Secondly, it’s unfair this is on you, you’re very young and shouldn’t have to feel accountable for your parents feelings. 

Third, is there come context we are missing? You are in therapy and cutting which means you must be going through something. Perhaps you should start there. Don’t worry about them, focus on what is causing you to feel the need to self-harm. I know it’s non-lethal but it’s still an indicator of some kind of emotional/psychological pain.

 I know you’re only 14, and when your that age, your emotions and moods tend to be a little stronger and exaggerated. But, there are somethings you can do to help manage your feelings:
- Exercise. You don’t have to be The Rock or Arnold Schwarzenegger, just some exercise that makes you feel good and takes the edge off
- Get a hobby, preferably something other than gaming. Could be martial arts, swimming, acting class. 
- A good community. This could be done with getting a hobby if you wanted. A class or church (I’m an agnostic so I would only encourage church for community purposes, not spiritual).
- Stay on top of school work.
-  NO DRUGS OF BOOZE, especially when you are feeling depressed
-Meditafion/Prayer. It can have calming effects (again, not for spiritual purposes, only psychological).

1k11qfx,mnj2y1f,TheOnlyKirby90210,"Ma'am what you are describing is financial abuse. And your husband is a narcissist and misogynist. He doesn't want you having financial freedom or any form of stability without being in control of it. If he wants to lower your current salary as is assistant then quit as his assistant and seek full time employment.

Men who preach about wanting the traditional wife looove to forget there were roles the traditional husbands did for their wives in the good ol' days. If he doesn't want you pursuing other work he should either let your pay reflect your contributions or like the 'traditional husband' should be doing as the sole breadwinner in the household he should be giving you a weekly allowance amount that is strictly for you and your upkeep and is not factored into what you're getting paid for working in the house. Any other money for the home or children or his own upkeep is an entirely separate thing that should have nothing to do with your allowance.

Look at the math: for what is essentially working 2 jobs (as a wife/mother and his home-based assistant) you're only earning $350 dollars PER WEEK between those --> two jobs <--. If you're using the USA current minimum wage you're only getting paid for working 48 hours out of 112 hour week for two jobs. For two simultaneous jobs.

How I did that math: 

168 hours in a week subtracting 56 hours minimum for sleeping (max estimate 8 hours a day). He's claiming being at home as a wife, mother and assistant is your full time job, so from the time you wake up you're on the clock until you fall asleep, so estimated to be 112 hours of awake time minimum.

Divide $1401 by 4 weeks in a month = $350 per week. Divide that by 7.25 current minimal wage, you get 48 hours of your total weeks pay. You are getting paid for less than half of what you should be earning on the grounds that he's the man and you're the woman. This is literally 2 days out of every single week of the year you're only getting paid for.

Realistically if you're getting paid for both jobs - I don't care what nobody say, making babies and keeping the house in order and acting as a personal assistant to support their business are two very different jobs! - at minimum wage rates: 14.50/hr multiplied by 112 hours each week = $1624 pay PER WEEK multiplied by 4 weeks a month you should be making roughly 6.5K rounded up per month, depending on where you live etc. Even if it was half of that you'd still be getting $3248 per month that would still have you earning 38.9K a year which is more than your current 16.8K yearly <- which by the way poverty status.  Putting that in perspective 1200 or less per month qualifies you for food stamps in some states.

Someone can correct the math if I'm wrong. I never claim to be a math genius but....the math isn't math'ing on his end. Even if he was only giving you 3K a month in allowance that 36K a year wouldn't even put a dent in his own finances.",3,1744862329.0

And I don't know you, but I am PROUD of you for the scores you have received and how hard you are working to making your life better. Your concerns need to be reported to a trustable adult, student counselor/school nurse/teacher someone who is able to see how much money you are bringing to school. Start documenting the day you get money and the amount, which parent. What you eat when you go home. Depending on where you are, you could also work at Publix and some grocery stores. Babysitting. Dog walking. See if you can find a trusted adult to help you get a prepaid card to add money too instead of having cash and see if they can keep it for you when you do have to go home. Also, see if one of the following options is in your country ModakMakers, Greenlight, Copper Banking, Acorns Early, Busy Kid and GoHenry, some of them have a monthly fee but it's not large. These are all kid friendly debit cards and your parents can ""monitor"" them. Tell them you want to start saving your money, if they start taking your money from the account you can always alert a teacher and have them help prove they don't give you any money and only take. But this will also help you get everything started to have your own account that eventually can be turned into an adult account once you are the legal age. Also, if you need to talk to an adult who has been in this situation please message me. I did not know how to help myself over 15 years ago and I don't mind giving you guidance.",4,1744868803.0

I highly recommend speaking to a school counselor. Reach out to any and all social workers you can. This is abuse and it only gets worse. Trust me, i have seen it happen with my own eyes.
He ended up in the foster care program which ended up being almost as terrible. He dropped out of high school and joined the trades. The future may look bleak, but what you are suffering now will only get worse if you stay. I recommend you use that money to find a way out of your situation and go through the system if you must, but get out once you can.

It sounds like your mom is sticking strictly to the boundaries she set years ago when you were in a less than ideal situation, it can be incredibly difficult for family members of people with addiction issues and sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself and your mental health is to keep the person in your life with a history of addiction at arms length as a form of self preservation. I don’t think you mom doesn’t care about you, I think your mom cares too much about the long term relationship between the two of you and most likely isn’t going to take into consideration how concerned you are about needing this short term help.

1k0qzg5,mng6jov,GarageIndependent114,"Maybe she actually does have autism. I imagine she has other issues as well though. But also that your reactions to her and those of your parents and other family members are making things worse.

Your sister might be a lovely person, she might be a terrible person, or anything in between - unfortunately, all I have to go on is your subjective answer, which could range anywhere from a legitimately insane person to a kindly victim of an abusive family with a disability to a deeply entitled machiavellian person who blames everyone else for her own problems.

She should also be treated for dyspraxia. 


Here's what I think she might be dealing with:

""tantrums over her socks being uncomfortable""

Many autistic and dyspraxic people have something called sensory issues. This means that they are a lot more sensitive to things they can touch than regular people are. What to you feels like a minor sock problem, to her probably feels like wearing a really itchy jumper all day (as in, a regular day and a shop bought jumper) whilst being told off for complaining about it.

""people looking at her""

It's true that some mentally ill people are unreasonably paranoid, but if she's not particularly crazy, but her own family members think she's insane and complete strangers look at her like she's got two heads because she's mildly disabled - can you blame her?

""not liking her dinner""

Imagine you're really hangry and you have to eat something you hate or are fine with but literally cannot eat (sensory issues again) , and if you refuse, your family won't give you anything else and will get annoyed with you....

""and ANYTHING I did""

You're sisters and you've just written a long diatribe about how awful you think she is. The feeling between the two of you is very likely mutual.

""Now, she's fine in public but only like this around family""

And gee, I hear her sister tolerates her presence and then gossips about her on reddit.

Seriously though, how do the rest of your family behave around her? Are they the same towards her?

""meanwhile she would...""

This might be a sign that you or your parents aren't as kind as you think, and being somewhat unkind or abusive, not likely on purpose but because they don't realise it. 

It might also be that she's struggling to find an outlet for her undiagnosed disabilities, or she may indeed be mentally unwell.

However, it doesn't necessarily mean she's mentally ill. A lot of autistic people experience moments called meltdowns, where everything gets too much for them and they either go mute, panic or explode. If your sister panics and freaks out or throws a tantrum, it might be that she's had a really stressful time and has suddenly snapped after trying to keep it under wraps.

""She's a very polite/shy girl""

If she's genuinely autistic, she probably struggles a lot with social situations. Being polite is a way to mask any social difficulties she's had and being quiet means she's not busy doing anything that might embarrass anyone or cause conflict.

She's probably also going to be kinder to strangers and acquaintances who like her and enjoy her company than to parents who punish her or a sister who is sick of her, and might be sick of you and them in the regular sense too, especially if she's experienced jealousy.

However, IF she's *not* autistic or dyspraxic or otherwise disabled, and neither are you or your family (objectively rather than according to you or them), and you and they don't behave differently in private to in public, she's either a mean person or potentially kind but objectively mentally ill, this might be a tactic of hers
to avoid taking accountability for her actions (if mean) or to hide her illness (if ill) because it might make you seem less reliable.

- The dog is her ""friend"" and her support animal. She's closer to it than other people because she's a dog and doesn't judge her or challenge her.

She's wary of others around her dog either because even as a dog, she's another ""person"" to consider and doesn't want her dog to lose her loyalty, or because the dog is in a sense both her property as a pet and her carer as a disabled person and by interacting with her dog, other people are in a sense interfering with her herself.",1,1744826859.0

We live in a diff state than where we grew up. MIL passed, left to the 3 kids. Sister lived in it. Paid the taxes.mortgage free. 

Didn’t tell us  she MOVED, found out when the letter to auction house off for back taxes came. 
We paid $5K immediately. 

But, we told his sister  and brother only way we pay is if we own the house. It had sat empty for nearly 3 years. They had tore it up anyways. They agreed, hired a lawyer to get them off deed. They signed rights away, it’s in our name  alone. We take 1-2 working vacas a year (a month each time) and are finally at rebuild stage. Had to be gutted, we did it all. 

So similar, but not exact. 

I would NEVER let someone take credit of what I paid and saved. 

Get a lawyer!!! You need that deed in BOTH names. Lawyers have ways to find records. Or to compel them. 

What’s to say sis doesn’t pass (I hope not but my 50 yo brother was hit by a car and died less than 2 years ago, things happen) and she wills the house to daughter and then you have an additional step to go through. 

Do it now! And no, you will not say the daughter came up with $6K!! You need to fix the deed. Don’t lie bc it will make things harder. Daughter trying to pull a fast one on you. You own 1/2 that house. 

Shes paid the taxes but what about upkeep?? Look what it cost us, tearing it down to the frame. I didn’t want to lose what his dad worked so hard for. Any idea what kind of shape house is in? Daughter isn’t even involved in this, your sister needs to act like an adult!

What he can do is start a saving fund for each child and create a journal in which he shares family history, photos , how  he misses them , how much he put into their investment or trust funds each birthday and Christmas, ECT.

1jz4cvw,mn3vfl3,TheOnlyKirby90210,"Wow. I will say it takes a special kind of entitled jerk to lay down an ultimatum like that to force someone to choose between their pets and their marriage. I will also say I'm the type of person to say I don't tolerate baseless ultimatums. Pets are family.  And yes to a degree women are very hormonal and can become more irritable right after pregnancy, but beyond that their behavior is a choice. Being overstimulated is an excuse to dismiss her behavior and her treatment of the cats. A way to rationalize to yourself why she's suddenly wants nothing to do with them (not that it seems she did in the first place since you're their primary human). This sounds to me more like the classic 'woman adopted kids, then had her own kids, now doesn't want the adopted ones anymore'. Some people emotionally lean on pets as surrogate children because they want something to love on and be loved by, but because they're animals they end up being treated as disposable accessories by after the fact. That is cruel towards living things!  Look at it this way: Those pets were raised in your home. You and to an extent your wife are literally their family unit, their world. They only know the life you gave and the love they get from you. Now your wife wants to discard them like last year's bag of the month and dump them in some overcrowded shelter so they can be someone else's 'irritation'. She's not the one seeing to their daily needs or having to interact with them, but she's going to turn your marriage upside down because her leg gets bumped into from time to time. If she's starting this early on using your child and marriage to get her way about small things, it's going to eventually escalate to threatening you for more serious or unreasonable matters when she wants to guarantee getting her way. It will branch into other things along the way because that's just how people are. I'd say call her bluff and tell her if this is some kinda test she's the one who failed not you and if she wants to use your kid as leverage then she can return to her parents and y'all will work out an amicable co-parent arrangement otherwise you're not getting rid of your pets and this is one of those times compromises and agreeing to disagree goes both ways.",0,1744656708.0

I say this all while coming from a place of understanding. I know what it's like to have to grieve a living parent. My mother was the good parent growing up. The one I loved. All the while my father was disgusted by my presence and hated being reminded of his children. 

It would take me a long time to realize she was abusing me too tho. She was simply the better option when it came to parents and was the only one to give me even a shred of attention. It never occured to me growing up that she should have protected me. That as the adult to a child she was obligated to protect me.

I got too trapped in the idea of us both being victims. And she was, in a way, a victim. But she was always just a bystander to it all, excusing my father's behavior or even justifying it to me, sometimes joining in.

1jyd32n,mn6kzju,NP_release,"Hate to ask but…How long do people in your family usually live? Is the typical peak in the mid 80s or is the average even older?? I ask because granny says she is going to die soon, so maybe she will and things will resolve on their own! Find out more about her health and the longevity of other direct family members if you can. 

Honestly, Dad needs to protect your mom, even from his own mother- that is his duty as a husband. But it sounds like he’s caving to granny’s demands. Which is definitely understandably discouraging.

Another thought is: are there ANY other siblings (uncles or aunts)? Can granny go live with them or other relatives? If so, your dad may offer a small stipend to help support his mother and save yall from nightmare grandma.

It’s me and my dogs. I’m married but he works so much and absorbs a massive amount of News /social  media  when home. I get about 1 hour a night with him. 

I worry when my dogs go ill lose the will to live. I have no friends either.  I moved 1100 miles away at age  25 and  never  made close friends here. 

I had 2 siblings here. I was with my sister 25/7 until about 10 years ago. She just stopped going anywhere at all. Her son went to prison and suddenly she’s sick all the time. She lives 1 mile from me , haven’t seen her in 10 years. 

My brother was here too but killed in July 2023, a car hit him while he was riding a bike, he died instantly. 
Lost mom in 2020. 

But we have to fight hard and keep going. Our moms would want us to (my dad bailed too, before I was born, he’s dead now too) 

We are strong enough. I read a ton. I garden alot too. I go to the beach for long walks and pick up trash. I walk my dogs daily, tho they are 11, 12 and 15 so I know it’s closer than ever. I volunteer as a guardian ad Litem tor abused kids in CPS system. I work part time.  I refinish old furniture. 

You live on bc mom wants you to. Ngl, it won’t be easy when you lose her. It’s been 5 years and I just stopped crying daily, recently. She was 1100 miles  away but I talked to her alot on phone and visited 2-6 times a year. I was on my way to see her in 2 days, I missed her by 2 lousy days. It was early into Covid and I think she died protecting me, to the very end. So I try to  make her proud. Say what you need to say now and ask what you need to ask now. My mom died unexpectedly. We didn’t know she had it till after she passed. But I was going bc in 20 years , was the first time she asked me to come home, I was going with no return date.

Left the house one day after my 18th birthday and only then I was able to start my healing journey. 
I had to go no contact with my father and low contact with my mother because I just couldn’t handle the toxic behaviors anymore. They got divorced the next year. I’m sure I helped her somehow, I like to think that all those years of effort helped to get her to this place where she felt empowered to leave, but truly she did when she felt ready. I’m just sharing this because I see you, and I understand how much you want to take care of your mother and make things right for her but she’s the one that can actually change it, but you should take care of yourself too, soon you’ll become an adult and real life will start, so don’t forget to take care of you.

Well my aunt was there who I haven’t seen in a few years and I just spilled some details on why I felt left out and the odd ball, and always have been. She didn’t have much of a response, but it was comforting to have someone who is blood actually seem to listen. I rant to my husband and other people but it was nice ranting a little to her specifically because she is blood and is apart of the broken family.

1jtsgsq,mm33wdo,2ndcupofcoffee,"Some families have a hard time celebrating a female child but go all out when a boy is born.  Some grandparents are all about babies but lose interest as a grandchild grows up.  Some grandparents have a favorite child and any baby born to that child has higher status.  Sorry they are behaving with such partiality. 

Consider honing your skills as a photographer.  Babies and children are so easy to photograph well especially with a long lens.  

Design a project.  Perhaps photograph your child in the same pose on the same day each year.  Take shots at a playground while your daughter is happy snd exuberant and then pick best shots.  You can even go online to sites where you submit photos that are turned into a hard cover book. Perhaps you could fo one every year.

You can’t change the grandparent favoritism.  But you can make lemonade out of a lemon.  Once you focus on photographing your child and learning techniques and printing out the really good ones, your photos and your daughter may start getting attention from outside the family.  That may ultimately make the grandparents feel they are missing out. Could bringing out a more balanced situation.

1jswjk7,mmnjk19,fudgyvmp,"It sounds like you don't have much knowledge of Christian holy days or the liturgical calendar. You should educate yourself about the religion you claim to follow before teaching your children falsehoods and lies by mistake.


Pascha (what you call easter), was celebrated by Christians before they ever arrived on Great Britain and met the people of Kent who called the month of April eostremonth after their goddess eostre, who we know zero of the worship practices of. The only thing we know about her is that the people of Kent named the month of April after her. That is the only knowledge we have of her, from Bede the Venerable writing about the calendar system in use where he lived, while he himself promoted modernizing the calendar system (he popularized AD/Anno Domini/Year of the Lord, as a replacement to Anno Martyrum, Year of the Martyrs, that counted years from the reign of Diocletian, where AD is years from the birth of Christ)

How can easter be based on pagan worship of Esotre, if we don't know how Eostre was worshipped. And why is Easter timed to match Passover, as the Bible describes Easter as the Sunday after passover? How is that pagan?


Halloween likewise has no relation to Samhain.

Halloween is All Saints Eve. All Saints was originally called All Martyrs, and was celebrated the Sunday after Pentecost for several hundred years. And then was moved to November first in the 700s, and rebranded All Saints to honor all Christians and not just those executed for their faith, as Christiandom had spread far and wide, and being executed for your faith was far less common. This was done in Italy. 


The first record of Samhain is from the 800s in ireland, well after the creation of All Saints. 

How can Halloween be based on Samhain, if we have no record of it until after the creation of Halloween?


I have never seen a Christian worship Saturn on Christmas. 

Do you also want to cancel Saturdays as pagan worship to Saturn?",2,1744416286.0
1jswjk7,mmwk3mi,Letsjustlisten,"Pascha in Hebrew means Passover. If you read the gospels, the last supper was on “the day of unleavened bread” or the first day of Passover. He was crucified as the Passover lamb of God, so why do we celebrate it a week late during Easter? Why do we do the same pagan rituals of an Easter bunny (symbolizing fertility) and decorating eggs (symbolizing renewal). Early Christians under no godly authority adopted these practices and put new names and meanings to the same ritual.
Christmas also makes no sense for Christian’s to celebrate. The early Christians did not celebrate birthdays because they believed it to be pagan. Jesus also wasn’t born in the winter, he was born in the spring. When shepherds were tending their fields. Sheep only give birth to lambs in the spring. The ritual of Christmas was condemned by God in the Old Testament. Jeremiah 10:3-5. It is older than Jesus but later adopted again and “christianized” into Christmas under no authority of Jesus or God. 
Halloween if you look up the origins did start as pagan. “The traditions of Samhain and All Hallows' Eve gradually merged, creating the holiday we know today. Over time, Halloween incorporated various customs, including trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, and wearing costumes.” These are pagan rituals being intertwined with religion. All ordered by Pope Gregory III in the 8th century. Again with no authority of God.
God said to not worship him how the pagans worship their gods. “You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way. But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go,”
‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭12‬:‭4‬-‭5‬ 
Yet that’s exactly what we are doing. That’s why I say I believe they have intentionally or unintentionally made golden calf’s out of these celebrations. 
God commanded Moses to keep pascha, feast of unleavened bread, and feast of first fruits FOREVER. Not just when we decide to change them into what we want. Leviticus 23, exodus 12 & 23. And before you say Jesus made an end to these commands, he said and I quote. ““Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5‬:‭17‬
He did not abolish these holy days ordained by God. He is the fulfillment of these holy days. That’s why I celebrate them with Jesus in the center of them.

Over time, Halloween incorporated various customs, including trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, and wearing costumes.” These are pagan rituals being intertwined with religion. All ordered by Pope Gregory III in the 8th century. Again with no authority of God.
God said to not worship him how the pagans worship their gods. “You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way. But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name and make his habitation there. There you shall go,”
‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭12‬:‭4‬-‭5‬ 
Yet that’s exactly what we are doing. That’s why I say I believe they have intentionally or unintentionally made golden calf’s out of these celebrations. 
God commanded Moses to keep pascha, feast of unleavened bread, and feast of first fruits FOREVER. Not just when we decide to change them into what we want. Leviticus 23, exodus 12 & 23. And before you say Jesus made an end to these commands, he said and I quote. ““Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5‬:‭17‬
He did not abolish these holy days ordained by God. He is the fulfillment of these holy days. That’s why I celebrate them with Jesus in the center of them. Not the pagan holidays that the Catholic Church “christianized” to appease to the world rather than obeying God and his commands.",1,1744556090.0

Years later they broke up and she fell into depression because he was basically her entire world since she isolated from everyone.

Judging by both you and your sister age, I can guarantee they are also going to break up eventually and she’s going to regret picking him over you, just give it time.

She’s probably also in a codependent relationship but she will only realize this when the relationship is over.

1js7b12,mlolxd5,Florida1974,"I would go NC if this is how my parents treated me. You are adults now. Just as you had to respect their lifestyle as a minor, they need to respect your lifestyle as an adult, and your sisters. 

I will never get it, how parents can’t love unconditionally.  They may not agree but they still love you and welcome you (and whoever) into their home bc you are  their child  

Maybe tell them no contact might be the right decision if this continues. 

Sure we should all respect our parents but that doesn’t mean they should hv to approve of your decisions. As long as you are happy, they should be happy for you. 

My mom was racist AF. The only time I ever got hit (it was the 70s and 80s, parents did whip kids) was when my mom told me I had to tell my friend she had to leave, bc she was black. I told her she was  ignorant; I was 10 yo and received a smack across the face. (This made my young mind research everything about slavery and racism) 

It took decades but I finally convinced her racism was wrong. And it took a close black friend to do it. I warned him about her. He was a good friend of the guy I was dating (who is now my husband). Mom needed a huge bush cut down in yard and asked my bf to do it . He agreed but said he would be bringing a buddy to help. I warned hose friend and he said it was fine. My mom was pleasant enough. Then she really sat and talked with him. She’s bringing out iced tea, laughing at his jokes (he is really funny). Then we upped and moved 1100 miles away. Our black friend  would go shovel her walks and put salt down. We didn’t ask, neither did she. He just did it on his way to work.

I went back for a visit and she starts telling me what he had been doing. Next thing I know she’s crying and telling me she was wrong for decades and felt so bad that she felt that way for so long. She finally realized what I knew at 10 yo, that you should judge ppl in how they treat you, how  they talk to you, not by their skin color. She eventually sat down and told him how she  was raised and  how she wished her parents had done what she did -she raised me to think for myself. She apologized to him for being racist. 

Patents get set in their ways. Sometimes we can open their eyes, sometimes we can’t. I wouldn’t go NC over that but I refused to let her say anything derogatory about black ppl bc she knew I would get up and leave. 
Children can teach parents too. 

Good luck with whatever you decide to do. As long as your kids are happy and safe, that should be enough!!!

A conversation means drama and guilt trips, it’s completely unnecessary. As for the second part about your daughter, a simple “no she doesn’t want to and we won’t force her” is all you need.

1jrs9g3,mlrh9zk,qu_lile,"I also have a niece with some problems. It started when she was very young, and got very bad in her early teens, she is almost an adult now. She has mental health issues from neglect from her parents, child protective service and foster parents, it led her to using heavy drugs (luckily only weed now). Because of child protective service and the foster parents me and other family members was excluded from her life almost her entire childhood, which didn’t help her mental health (and no, there was no reason to exclude us from her life). Luckily we got in contact about 3 years ago. I am one of the few people she trust. She can talk to me about anything, i don’t hide things from her, i’m always honest with her, and i don’t see her as a problem. She tells me if she is in trouble, if she use drugs, or if she just need someone to talk to. It makes her feel safe, and i can rest my mind knowing that she will call me no matter what.

Your niece trust you, so first i would try talking to her. Most likely it will take some time to get to the bottom of everything, but find out what she is dealing with, find out if you can help her in any way, educate her (but don’t lecture her) on life and possible dangers, do stuff with her, take her out on activities. If you go straight to her parents chances are that you loose her trust and she may put herself in more danger without a safe person to have her back. Trust is a very fragile thing.

If it is something really bad that seems out of hand, i would talk to the parents (as long as they are good, functional parents), but don’t do it behind her back, don’t blindside her. 

It’s not a guaranteed recipe for success i’m sure, but it worked with my niece, so just my advice from my experience.",1,1743974402.0

You have to go with your gut with that. Just keep in mind children want to please adults, so they may do things they don't want to because they think it'll make the adult happy, and sometimes they actually want to do it. It's a tough call but you are your child's advocate, so ultimately it's your decision to do what's best for them. If it's a cycle of I want to/I don't want to, that (to me) is a sign that something isn't quite right. Perhaps a more heart to heart talk just asking questions as to why and how your kids are feeling will help. 

My mother started to treat my nephew like crap once he was about 10 years old (you know, no longer fully compliant), and that boy loved her so much he just took it and took it and just wanted to prove he was lovable to her. We all have stupid excuses for it, but IMHO it really hurt his self esteem and looking back, we should have been more forceful with my mother (this is why she's limited to when she gets to see my son).

1jqm2ff,ml8ca0i,2ndcupofcoffee," The lego situation may have been a teaching moment for both.  Knowing there are issues and how much hr likes legos, you could have monitored what he brings with him.  Grandma, once he pulled out his legos, had a disagreeable choice and decided to let him play to avoid a meltdown. But she was likely feeling set up. 

Meanwhile his previous disrespect for grandma (when he took her legos) has now been reinforced because he still hears that her reaction was not okay while his reaction is acknowledged but not that strongly.  He will probably decide that he should get what he wants and take the chances he takes because he doesn’t really lose anything.  That will make relationships and workplaces very difficult for him and others.  

So grandma is in the dog house but what consequence has your son experienced by flouting that rule.

In yourself, ask yourself if you are really content with the changes your mom has made in herself or are you still angry with her?",2,1743700357.0
1jqm2ff,ml8hxgc,Responsible-Start307,"Ooh! So much to think about here.


I know I still have my own fears and resentments towards my mom when it comes to parenting. Though she has made huge efforts to change and do better, part of me is still a scared child. 


I have been using reparenting to heal from childhood trauma, but it has been a slow and laborious process.


Your thoughts about inadvertantly rewarding my son for stealing, while blaming my mom are things I will need to think more about.


Also, your insight that my son isn't really losing that much so he will continue to passive aggressively do what he wants. Is valid. I struggle with him stealing candy and ice cream from me, and sneaking technology time at home


Holding him accountable seems hard as well though. The amount of energy and effort it takes to do with things with him is astounding sometimes. And, I have to constantly watch how I'm approaching things with him because when he gets upset he runs away from home. (This behavior is called elopement).


He's already been brought back by the police five or six times in the last 8 years. So we're also worried about CPS intervention because of his running away. Again most of this is autistic stuff, I have reached out to therapist about getting new ideas in how to work with him. They mostly want me to attend their workshops which requires a babysitter so that I can attend the workshops. Sometimes I feel very overwhelmed and helpless.


This pattern affecting his ability to work a job in the real world is also a valid concern. His older half brother, who is also AS, is on permant disability. My cousin who is AS is also on permant disability and lives in a care home. 


I have a younger brother and cousin who are also AS, but did not get the diagnosis till much later because they were so high functioning. (My son first showed problems at 18 months old.)


My brother is independent and has a job, but will likely never have a romantic relationship and has dogs instead.


While I hope to give my son the best chance in having an independent life, I am not always confident that will be a reality.


Back to yesterday.


I did not know my son had brought his Legos to Grandma's house. I usually let my kids pack their own stuff without any monitoring on my part. He wasn't allowed to bring his tablet because he hadn't finished his school work. It is common for him to play with Legos when he can't have technology time. I have my mom watch them so rarely, (partly because my oldest daughter often doesn't want to go) I admit I had forgotten he wasn't supposed to bring his Legos until it created a problem this time. 


I'm also growing concerned that now my son just doesn't want to go to Grandma's house. My oldest daughter doesn't want to go to Grandma's house. My mom is uncomfortable watching them. 


My mom is pretty much the only babysitter I have. It would take a lot of effort to try and find ane prepare a stranger who would be able to watch them for pay. I haven't gotten that desperate yet. Although, in 2 years my daughter will legally be old enough to watch my kids for a couple of hours so I could just do that I suppose.

1jqm2ff,mlahdya,SaltyMomma5,"To a point. But making children be alone with adults they are uncomfortable with tells children they have no choice and the adults feelings are more important than theirs. That's not healthy, and teaches them they aren't allowed to have boundaries. My parents made me stay with my aunt and uncle regularly as a child, and my aunt was a monster to me and my cousins. All I was told was to respect her and suck it up because i probably did something to make her mad. Parents need to talk to their children and go with their gut. If grandma needs a serious sit down discussion, it needs to happen. But if kids are overreacting, then helping the children see what's okay and what's not needs to happen. 

If they're uncomfortable, especially after what appear to be minor incidents, I'm wondering if there's more that's actually causing them to feel uncomfortable. Could be as simple as the kids think grandma raises her voice too often (which I think a vast majority of people in general do this with kids from time to time), or it could be something more.

You have to go with your gut with that.

Sometimes we get upset when ppl make us do things we dont want. And for a kid that could be taking put the garbage helping with dinner dishes not being alloud to bring certain toys certain places etc. All of these things do not warrent limiting time with grandma over. It does warrent telling ypur kids while having big feelings over being made tp do things ypu dont want to do its important to learn.

Maybe you had a longggg day was treated like crap but still need to go groccery shopping because therea nothing to eat at home? Guess what it still has to be done. Instilling these ideas into our kids at 5-13 set them up for success and proper emotional devolopment. We shouldnt treat our kids like slaves or ask them to do anything we wouldnt do. Taking out the trash, hwlping with dishes cleaning their room or helping fold laundry is all good things to have them do. And if they dont like grandma because she has rules.

1jqm2ff,ml8hxgc,Responsible-Start307,"Ooh! So much to think about here.


I know I still have my own fears and resentments towards my mom when it comes to parenting. Though she has made huge efforts to change and do better, part of me is still a scared child. 


I have been using reparenting to heal from childhood trauma, but it has been a slow and laborious process.


Your thoughts about inadvertantly rewarding my son for stealing, while blaming my mom are things I will need to think more about.


Also, your insight that my son isn't really losing that much so he will continue to passive aggressively do what he wants. Is valid. I struggle with him stealing candy and ice cream from me, and sneaking technology time at home


Holding him accountable seems hard as well though. The amount of energy and effort it takes to do with things with him is astounding sometimes. And, I have to constantly watch how I'm approaching things with him because when he gets upset he runs away from home. (This behavior is called elopement).


He's already been brought back by the police five or six times in the last 8 years. So we're also worried about CPS intervention because of his running away. Again most of this is autistic stuff, I have reached out to therapist about getting new ideas in how to work with him. They mostly want me to attend their workshops which requires a babysitter so that I can attend the workshops. Sometimes I feel very overwhelmed and helpless.


This pattern affecting his ability to work a job in the real world is also a valid concern. His older half brother, who is also AS, is on permant disability. My cousin who is AS is also on permant disability and lives in a care home. 


I have a younger brother and cousin who are also AS, but did not get the diagnosis till much later because they were so high functioning. (My son first showed problems at 18 months old.)


My brother is independent and has a job, but will likely never have a romantic relationship and has dogs instead.


While I hope to give my son the best chance in having an independent life, I am not always confident that will be a reality.


Back to yesterday.


I did not know my son had brought his Legos to Grandma's house. I usually let my kids pack their own stuff without any monitoring on my part. He wasn't allowed to bring his tablet because he hadn't finished his school work. It is common for him to play with Legos when he can't have technology time. I have my mom watch them so rarely, (partly because my oldest daughter often doesn't want to go) I admit I had forgotten he wasn't supposed to bring his Legos until it created a problem this time. 


I'm also growing concerned that now my son just doesn't want to go to Grandma's house. My oldest daughter doesn't want to go to Grandma's house. My mom is uncomfortable watching them. 


My mom is pretty much the only babysitter I have. It would take a lot of effort to try and find ane prepare a stranger who would be able to watch them for pay. I haven't gotten that desperate yet. Although, in 2 years my daughter will legally be old enough to watch my kids for a couple of hours so I could just do that I suppose.


Again though, is that what's best for my kids or is that just what's most convenient for me?",0,1743701991.0

My sibling had a friend in high school whose dad walked out on his kids when their mother passed away, then went to live with another woman who had a 13 year old daughter. It turned out that he was s\*ually abusing her for 3 YEARS without anyone knowing. He is now in prison.

On a less severe note, I had a friend in middle school whose mom remarried a man with a daughter the same age as us. However, he was severely bullied by his new sister behind the parents' back and even bullied him at school. It was an awful situation because he was embarassed, and most importantly, felt like he couldn't speak up because he didn't want to ruin his mom's new happy relationship.

1jo7wxv,mkujgk7,,"I feel like I have lived a parallel life. Catholic upbringing, feeling shame about sex and my body, disordered eating (also binge eating), invasion of privacy, emotionally abusive and manipulative mother. 

It's hard because it usually isn't black and white. My parents were good parents in many ways but would never acknowledge wrong doing and would shamed me instead. It is frustrating because the shaming of you is a lack of accountability for them and so you can never expect an apology or for them to change their behavior And with the shame you become burdened with everyone else's failing, problems, and sins and if you can't carry it all you are blamed more. 

My Dad also enables my Mom, never intervened when she berated me. I have feel I have played therapist for my Mom over the years but I can't ever expect her to empathize with me. It takes so much work it hardly feels worth it.

I can sympathize with your situation. I think many people in this situation became parentified. No one ever talked to me about sex so I had to educate myself. I had an unexpected pregnancy at a young age and experienced so much shame from my parents I left the state with my now ex (turned out to be controlling and abusive like my Mom). I had to teach myself a lot of things growing up. I became hyper independent, I have to do everything myself. I have trust issues in relationships. I feel like there were many times I should have been protected and wasn't and many times I had to be the adult because my parents acted like children. 

I don't have advice but having a similar situation, I understand how it can be confusing. You have been molded into a codependent caregiver for other people. I like that I am kind but I also feel I have to sacrifice so much for other people it is a burden. People have different responses to this type of family trauma though. It really sounds like you are the family scapegoat and your mother is a narcissist though.

Please do not harm yourself.  It’s not your fault that you have a mom that is unable to be a mother. You have everything inside of you to make yourself a better life.  Start making a plan for yourself.  Go to your orientation by yourself.  Take buses or ride a bike to get there.  Leave early and walk if you have to. You are your own best friend.  Give your self positive affirmations everyday so you don’t have to hear the negative coming from your family. Write out what you would like your life to look like in the future and then write down steps to get there.  You need to find some jobs and start making money.  Put your money in a bank account and tell no one. Use your public library to search for training programs.  Can you babysit?  Can you run errands for people.  Wash dishes at a restaurant?  Anything you can think of to make money legally and save it.  Start investing in yourself. Meet new people that are working hard. Look for shared living quarters and separate from your mom as soon as financially possible. You got this.  20 is so young.  You are strong and you can do hard things.

You need to plan how you can get out and live by yourself or with a friend/sibling.

You already resisting abuse from the woman who was supposed to love you and care for you--you are stronger than you might think.

If you have a habit of not cleaning up after yourself it's less about the meal and more about the stress of knowing she has to either nag you to clean up or has to go clean it herself, so she can't exactly enjoy the nice gesture. I know it feels frustrating on your end but cant just enjoy yourself and leave the mess for everyone else. Part of loving any hobby is also cleaning up after you're done. Knitting for example is my hobby. It creations a LOT of lent and dust. Nothing that can't be solved with some wet wipes and a few minutes of my time.

1jmyfkk,mkflrms,DuckInternational910,"Oldest daughter here (32). Was in a similar abusive situation when I was 18. My brother and sister got to skirt under the radar while I was under a microscope with my parents. They were emotionally and verbally very abusive even though I was an adult. Truthfully what it came down to, is they were starting to get scared they were losing their strong grip on me as I tried to gain more independence. 

It's an exhausting journey but just keep going. Keep your blinders on, save money, and keep doing research on places to live, best places to find roommates, etc. I worked and went to school, and did side jobs just to stay away from home and make a little extra money. I worked at a restaurant in the evenings/weekends and nannied after school. Pet sitting, babysitting, dog walking, it makes really good money! Budget, and if you don't have a bank account already then definitely get one so your dad or sister don't try to take money. My mom had the same tactic, we had a shared bank account and she yanked all my money out of my savings to try and punish me. 

This will be hard but just keep hustling. When I found a place to live I moved everything out during the day when my parents weren't home, get help from friends if you can. Don't let your dad or sister know where you're moving when the day comes. I blocked their numbers and told them they could only contact me through email. 

Consider looking for resources through your school. You are still a child, and what your father is doing is absolutely abuse. I ended up being honest with my college counselor and it was the best decision I made. She helped me a ton and became a huge recourse and mentor. Helped me find a nanny job, even helped me try and find a place to live with my budget.

Dental diseases alone can clear out a room if the neglect goes for too long that it causes gum rot. Rot, as it decaying flesh. If he’s not cleaning using antibacterial soap what is he using? Is anyone actually checking that he’s cleaning himself the right way? He needs a towel or body sponge lathered up and scrubbing every nook and cranny. There is a chance he has some sort of skin affliction that me might be unaware if he’s not being aware of his body. As an overweight person I have to check everywhere there is a skin fold to make sure it’s all washed because if not sweat and dead skin builds up into a funky slime. Also have to check my belly button because the build up can also cause painful sores and funky odor.

Being older now, and a parent myself now. I’ve tried really hard to keep things as close and “fair” as possible, and the reality is…. You have to adapt your parenting to each child because each child is a different individual. The first child is the “trailblazer” - essentially breaking parents in. Each successive child reaps the benefits of the older getting the parents used to the ideas and items that come along. The baseline parental instinct is to protect your kids, and you shouldn’t  fault them for that (even if it can be annoying as heck). Instead of thinking about it as “unfair”… consider the fact that you showed your parents that having a phone isn’t so bad for a young kid… you PROVED to them that a kid could handle it. It’s not that she deserved it sooner than you, but that you earned that opportunity for her.  And trust me, there will be other things like this that come up. I get it.. it’s frustrating… but if your sister ever acts like she’s “better” because she got something or got to do something earlier than you… remind her that YOU paved the way for her and that she should be thanking YOU for being responsible and showing your parents the way.",1,1743250033.0

I was floored. I would've been grounded for 2 weeks. Then our 15 year old sister comes flying in, complaining that she could've skipped that extra class and just come home, too.

My jaw hit the floor. I went to the stairs and was like ""Mom, I'd have been grounded for **at least a month**. Wtf.""

She just laughed.

It’s so tough when your own mother makes you feel like shit so I know the feeling. The best advice I can give is try to mentally distance yourself from her to protect your own self esteem and build up your own self worth by spending time with lovely people. When she’s shit with you maybe cry it out but then put on your favourite movie and make sure to go to sleep happy. 

She also might be going through her own shit so perhaps try to talk to her about how she’s feeling without interrupting.",1,1743192965.0

I’d suggest getting a job first before you do anything. At 15 you can only work so many hours. Plus you need to manage to get to and from work. Life these days are more expensive than ever. My advice would be if you’re able to put your head down, don’t argue back with them, get a job, get use to the work life. Save up your money and keep it in the bank where your parents can’t have access to it. I know it’s silly but do a pros and cons list.

1jlhh2z,mk3roh0,rabidcfish32,"Well the best advice is you need a therapist. But money sounds like an obstacle. If you want to try though I recommend searching for a licensed counselor and one that is in training. You don’t need someone with a doctorate in psychology. But someone with a master’s degree in social work can also get their license in counseling. They have to complete hundreds of hours of treating clients before becoming fully licensed. The tip is, they are the cheapest. You can also ask for a sliding fee scale. 

Beyond that my advice is you are in a position of silently judging your parents and siblings with their life choices. I don’t mean like look down on them. But look at their life choices. From the outside and looking back what could have gone differently for them? What choices have they made that hurt them in the long run? Any patterns you see? Basically, learn from their mistakes. But don’t tell them their mistakes either. 

You are young. You don’t have to find another relationship right away. Take time and really reflect on yourself. What you need to do to make yourself a better person. What was it that attracted you to your first husband? Any red flags you can see now that you are looking back. 

I know you want to help your family. But they have to help themselves. No one can make anyone else change or be better. 

I encourage you to keep working on making yourself as financially secure as you can. Saving money, maybe more education if it will lead to a better paying job. Nothing is wrong with a side hustle while still working as an influencer. 

I think you will do better if you can be independent of your family financially. Even if you decide to still live with them and help them. Please also make sure you are working on securing yourself too. 

I don’t know what trauma happened to your siblings or yourself in your childhoods. But as someone who came from trauma and is about 20 yrs older than you, in my experience you can’t ignore the trauma. You have to face it and work through how it is effecting you. It is an on going process. You do the work on yourself and get to a good place. Then a few more years you might do more work. Then some more. But you can’t escape it in any healthy way.",2,1743121977.0
1jlhh2z,mk3zfiv,Dramatic-Stranger392,"Thank you so much for taking the time to respond I really appreciate it.

I’ve been in therapy for over a year, trying different therapists. It helped me overcome anxiety and fears, but in the long run, I realized that therapy alone doesn’t fix anything. I have to do the work staying fit, being financially stable, having hobbies, and surrounding myself with good people. Therapy gave me the push, but real change had to come from me. That’s why I eventually stopped going

At one point, I was diagnosed with depression and took Zoloft for six months. It helped me focus on my career, but it also made me feel isolated, numb, and disconnected from myself. My bubbly, funny side faded away, and I had constant nightmares. Later, I was diagnosed with ADHD because I struggle with focus, decision-making, and feeling overwhelmed. Alhamdulillah, I feel much better now. I’m not crying in my room every day like before, I’m more outgoing, and I’m more focused on my career. But something I’ve realized about myself is that I never give 100% to anything in my life, and I don’t know why.

When it comes to my ex husband, I was drawn to his energy, ambition, and kindness. He had a good heart, and we shared big dreams. Before marriage, I felt like a free butterfly with him, our connection was fun, exciting, and full of potential. But after marriage, I slowly lost my identity, my passions, and my sense of self. I had to change the way I dressed, my music taste, my lifestyle to fit into his expectations. I felt controlled rather than loved

He had a habit of making “jokes” at my expense, small, cutting comments disguised as humor. I’d tell him they hurt me, but instead of listening, he’d say I was being too sensitive and needed to “chill.” I found this selfish and dismissive. It made me feel like my emotions were never valid.

The trust issues made things even worse. He constantly dug into my past, questioning everything. I hated talking about it, so I would hide things not because I was dishonest, but because I didn’t think every little detail mattered. Sometimes, I would lie about the past just to avoid unnecessary drama. But for him, it was a huge deal, and he would never let it go. Small issues turned into huge fights.

I left my family, my friends, and my home country to be with him. At first, I lived with his family before we got our own place. Me and his mom were best friends, they loved me and I loved them so much 
I was excited to build a life together, but I quickly realized how lonely marriage could be. The little things hurt me the most like when I was on my period, crying, and just wanted a cup of tea, instead of making it for me, he would just order it. I appreciated the effort, but it felt so distant and impersonal. His love language was never acts of service, while mine was.

I gave my all to him, I cooked, cared for him, supported him, and even took care of his family and friends. But I never felt that same level of effort in return. He loved me, but not in the way I needed to be loved.

Now, looking back, I see the signs I ignored

Give yourself a break on the putting a 100 percent into something. That is your ADHD lying to you. You are likely giving what you have the emotional energy to give to whatever you are doing. That is not the same for everyone. It isn’t even the same for the same person on any given day and time. Depression sucks out passion and energy too.

1jknw8q,mk0t6bw,qu_lile,"Yes. My brother, 4 months ago. Have done this in the past and took him back into my life, but no more. He is a liar, and never ever take responsibility for his actions and words and how they hurt people around him, and stir up drama for no reason (so does his wife). He don’t care about me, our other siblings, his kids (none live with him) or our parents. Our dad got very sick a couple of years ago and i really thought he changed after that and that we finally could have a good relationship, but no. He is just my brother on paper and that’s it. I don’t miss him, my life is drama-free and filled with positive energy when he’s not in it. Our siblings has also cut him out of their life. The only one who talks to him are our parents, but considering how awful he is against our mother, i’m not surprised if they also eventually cut him out of their life. 

If i run into him or we have to gather at a family-related thing i will be polite and say hi, but nothing more (but in my case, the odds of him showing up at anything family-related are very slim, as he don’t give a damn about anything other than himself and his current (third) wife).

It is extremely hard to cut out family, because, family. But it is important to ask oneself if keeping them in your life is good for you. If they just drain your energy, stirs up drama for no reason and are awful to you, cut them out. You don’t need that kind of people and negativity in your life.",1,1743087799.0

First and foremost have your husband go to his current bank, cash out completely, and open a banking account under his name and do not ever put his mother on it! That should have been done when he turned 18, or at the very least when he entertained the thought of marriage. His mother is no longer the center of his life, you are. Secondly if she opens her mouth never believe a thing your MIL says she’ll do. She made it very obvious she was being shiesty from the beginning and you guys still wanted to be amicable and give her the benefit of the doubt. That was a bad move on your parts. Always trust your instincts. And third don’t let her guilt trip you over finances. Whatever decisions she makes she’s done this for 70 years of life. She knows what she’s doing. And I bet she’s sitting on a stack of cash she saved from all the labor her sim out into the landscaping plus your earnings from helping with the child care. If the house is in her name let her keep it and let it rot. File a quitclaim deed which relinquishes his part of ownership to the co-owners and walk away from that mess. As much as it hurts, objects are objects. You’re giving up material possessions but you’d be gaining freedom from your MIL’d crazy control tactics. As for the storage unit, again it’s material possessions. If you give the storage rental notice and say you don’t want the stuff back they will either throw the things away or auction it off. Contact them, explain that your MIL is trying to hold your things hostage and you don’t want it anymore. They may work with you. In the mean time moving forward I hope you and your family build and prosper, OP. Times may get a little rough but once you guys have your freedom all that will matter is you, your husband, and your children’s togetherness.",2,1743033634.0
1jkna5q,mjxjkuu,Sandbunny85,"1. Accept who she is—and what she’s never going to be.
Bella is not going to change, be reliable, show empathy, or support your family in the way you need. Waiting for her to “come around” only gives her more power to hurt you. Accepting that she is selfish and manipulative frees you from expecting different behavior.

2. Protect your peace—go no contact or very low contact.
Gio may not be ready for full NC, but you don’t have to deal with her. Create strict boundaries:
	•	No phone calls.
	•	No updates about the baby.
	•	No emotional labor from you.
Let Gio manage her if he insists on keeping a thread of communication.

3. Let go of the baby items and cat—emotionally.
Yes, it sucks. But Bella is using them as leverage. Rebuild what you need for baby #2 without involving her. Keep receipts and make a wishlist—friends and strangers can be more of a “village” than toxic family.
As for the cat: if it’s safe and cared for, leave it. If not, report it stolen or talk to a lawyer.

4. Legal and logistical steps to consider:
	•	See if Gio can remove her from the storage unit legally or transfer it fully to his name.
	•	Create a detailed inventory of what’s in storage and assess what’s replaceable.
	•	If she continues to withhold belongings or pet intentionally, you may have grounds for civil action (though it’s rarely worth the emotional toll unless high-value items are involved).

5. Therapy—for you and Gio.
This kind of trauma and long-term emotional abuse has lasting effects. Therapy can help you heal, reinforce your boundaries, and help Gio untangle his guilt.

6. Start a new legacy.
This cycle ends with you. Keep the focus on your kids, your peace, and your own values. Bella will fade. You won’t regret protecting your family’s joy.",2,1743035112.0

“Cats fine,” we get pictures once a week maybe. But forbid we are late on that payment for the storage unit. “Our” house we pushed her to rent it, she refused. We even had friends willing to rent. Told her to sell it, can’t find a buyer. Gio told her once the family is out here I’m not paying the mortgage.  

she guilted him “I’ll have to get another job or take on more work to cover your mortgage” she is 70 years old. all that money, roughly $650 a month, we could spend on trying to get everything ready for little brother or give her to cover shipping us our stuff is going to a house no one lives in cuz she won’t rent or sell. She’s waiting on us to fail and come back. 

I’m ready to cry because we are scraping by. A few of the parents of our new after school program want to throw us a shower in April. Due in May, currently march. We are third trimester, basically 2 and a half months from due date. none of the baby stuff has been shipped even though we have been out here since November. Pods and other things like it, I have checked they do not have a branch in Bella’s area code. 

I’m low basically NC…I don’t even send her pictures or videos anymore, if I do it’s maybe every two weeks she’ll get one. She calls Gio daily and he’ll bring up the baby stuff or checks in on the cat but conversation goes no where cuz she changes the subject.  

I personally think she’s gotten attached to the cat. if she’s been half as lonely as she says she is I can see her kidnap the cat to keep for herself. ignoring pregnancy so it only makes sense she’d hold the baby stuff hostage. I doubt she knows our due date. 

No my parents won’t deal with her bs about meeting up at the storage unit or to get the key to send us stuff cuz she will have them jumping through hoops to even attempt. Gio can’t go out as he doesn’t feel comfortable leaving us alone. Gio does DoorDash/grub hub/uber/lyft during the morning or afternoon, so he’s basically working split shifts to cover everything. 

For years I worked 2/3 (waitress/after school care/baby sitting/plasma donor) jobs. Since firstborn it’s been “back pay time off, I want you to be able to see and be with our kids all the time. I owe you that, you deserve that.” If I don’t have any baby stuff by the shower I’ll be going NC and Gio knows that. He isn’t ready to go NC as it had only been the two of them forever. He knows what she’s doing is messed up, he knows it’s toxic but he’s just not ready to cut her out yet.  

small note to add, not sure whose idea but…she wants to fly in shortly before and hang out for roughly a week after I give birth. she wants to fly in to make things “easier” so are we paying to board our cat, her flight, and the mortgage on “our” house….or are things not as bad as she says they are cuz also her three landscaping customers 1. Is moving states. 2. Is older moving to a retirement home. 3. Is much much much older and apparently at deaths door. Updates if anything gets sent or if she shows.",-1,1743024704.0

Every adult has both freedom and the responsibility to use that freedom to create the life they want to live.  When there is a disconnect between my choices and the results of my choices, then something is wrong.  When I go to work every day, I expect a paycheck every couple of weeks.  If I forget to roll out the trash on garbage day, I don’t expect the garbage collector to run into my back yard and get it, I just learn to put a reminder on my calendar for next week.  Guilt is a short-term motivation, but doesn’t build love in my heart; guilt builds resentment.  We all have to look outside ourselves for knowledge and resources and to learn new skills.  What have you done to learn about appropriate family boundaries and how to help someone in a healthy way?  Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend’s book Boundaries is a classic that may be interesting.  Christ Jesus was motivated by love to come to us, and learning to be motivated by love is a lifelong journey for me!

My sis found addiction at the same time did. (approx) I won't share complete history. She let my other raise her 3 children, lost the one home my mother bought with  retirement money and leaving my mother to live in her van. 
""So, following my sisters path?""
Years later my mother begins to show signs of dementia. My sister asks for me, to get my Nina and mother's eldest sibling Of 70yrs still working as an RN, to release my mother to me and out of our aunts care. Knowing that this responsibility is ours to care for our mother convinced my aunt mom would be priority and that myself, wife, 3 children ➕️ Sister and her 3 kids and granddaughter help our mother would be ok. We made room in the Victorian rental and my whole family minus my eldest daughter were under one roof and storybook should have a [WHAT?] happy ending. I took mom to all her medical appointments to show proof of deteriorating health for a power of attorney and social security approved me and we should be good....
NOW!
GUESS WHAT MY SISTER DOES??
lol I come home one day to see my mom and nephews driving off with my mother. Wife didn't know they were laving... long story ending. My Lil sis Kidnaps [literally] my mother, has changed SSI card pin# and moved to mother to her married boyfriends house to cared for by his wife. I KNOW All that I could have done. But I was done. Dunno, 8-10 years now my sis has tried to contact me she says I have to visit mom. Then tells me mom isn't able to stay at that home anymore. Then tells me I need to take care of my mother [DONT GET ME WRONG, MY MOTHER WAS TOO INDEPENDENT RAISED US TO BE RELEASED AS MY GRANDFATHER WAS AT 16 & A $100. I REMIND MY SISTER OF HER ACTION AND THAT OU MOTHERS FINAL DAYS ARE HERS TO BARE. While my mom was with me she thanked me for taking care of her. I confessed the pain, stress, and sacrifices of being a parent, Apologized for my selfishness and trouble. We had our moment that is the happy ever after. My mothers Mom sat in a wheelchair no words with the once beautiful eyes stared at everyone she didn't know. I don't want to see that again.


Sorry and Thank You
Raul
PS. We all can change . Just be prepared and you be the ""Bigger Sister"" should her mature and come to you even if not with apologies or forgiveness.  You can forgive without asking it of you remove [you may not feel] the stress in remembering all the pain and treatment you endured.  Life is for you and your entertainment only.  ""

1jjyjzo,mjte7q1,UnevenFork,"I had a sudden (and prompted) realization in my mid to late 20s that my younger sister was never actually nice to me. The example that always pops into my head is the Christmas she gave me 2 really nice ponchos. I excitedly turned to her to tell her that I've been looking for *EXACTLY THIS*, how did you even -

She had already turned her head away from me to talk to someone else in the room. I didn't even get to fully say ""thank you"". She did the same thing when she told me she was pregnant with her oldest daughter. I got teary and excited and *she just turned away from me*.

I don't know what I did to her. We had issues growing up, but I thought we'd talked through that when I was in high school. Everything had been fine for a long time, basically until it wasn't.

My life has been so peaceful since cutting her out. I *hate* not knowing my niece's, but I hold out hope that they'll get curious in high school or early adulthood and come find their long lost fun aunt 🤣😅

1jjxq27,mjrrofl,Critical_Brain_7565,I see you are in a very sticky situation. I would consult a Social Worker. If and when your father goes on hospice I suggest he not stay in his home but to a facility. He will need 24/hr care and your brother is far from responsible nor is he a nurse to keep your father safe and comfortable. An elder care attorney prolly has dealt with these types situations. Does anyone have POA? For your father’s best interest one of you kids needs to have one. Does your father have a living will? Those are just some things I have dealt with my late parents. Usually the executor of the estate has POA too. An estate attorney can help you save money and avoid probate too. A Will is just not enough in your situation. Your situation is not unique trust me. These professional people can help guide you. I wish you well.,1,1742956691.0

You are the parent, you choose how to raise your kids. The moms has more say than the grandmother 10000%. You mom lives in a reality that her own true is what matters and is the ultimate truth! That will cause big harm own your kids (flat earth and anti science? No good) 

Living in the same house was a wrong decision, that will keep running your relationship with your fiancé. You didn’t even considered your fiancé wishes to NOT leave with your mom which I find very disrespectful and very mommy’s boy. Don’t you see that your future wife wants to raise a family with you? 

You have your own family now and your mom can destroy it for the pleasure of controlling you and her grandkids. Stop taking her side, listen to your fiancé, did you even thought that by denying her opinion more and more she (future wife) will grow apart from you and even leave you? Honestly if I was your fiancé I would definitely leave you if you don’t change, sorry but is true, I don’t like men with no action and that let other people control them. 

It’s not normal for your mom to control who the kids can see (their other grandparents), all evidence of her controlling nature are clear as day and you are denying it. 

The more control you give to her the more she will take, and you only being on her side won’t help you and your family. So yes, grow some balls, listen to your future wife and think the best for your kids, that is not living with this controlling grandmother…

While convenient, living right next door to your family  or your inlaws can get messy, especially if boundaries are often crossed and you expect a lot from them without letting them have the time to be a family themselves. That can feel claustrophobic pretty quickly to people who aren't used to that dynamic. Throw in house ownership and the potential of entitlement to access and this often implodes. Sometimes putting a bit of space between you all is better for everyone and all the relationships involved.

I suggest thinking back to whether there have been 'missing missing reasons' where your son or your daughter in law have expressed boundaries or feelings to you and you dismissing their concerns as you kind of are here.

It's also pretty common in families that can be difficult, to set the boundary of 'if they are husband's family, husband deals with boundaries or drama,' and vice versa especially if the family doesn't respect the person in your dil's position enough to want to work things out. Respect goes both ways.

But I also agree with the other posts, we can't know if it was justified or not with such minimum detail, but if it becomes abusive, loud, toxic, violent, and his episodes can be unpredictable, dil and your son can make the decision to protect their kids from the trauma of potentially witnessing an episode, especially if you've been dismissive or unwilling to compromise on their boundaries.",3,1742703589.0

It would all depend on the details of what this crisis was to make it easier to get an honest opinion.

If this was just a situation where they were yelling or where they were extremely upset, and there was no violence and the children weren’t there at all then it would seem to be she is overreacting or using this as an excuse. It’s quite odd that she claims to be so uncomfortable and yet is still staying on the property.

I would rearly see him.And after working outside he don’t want anything at home. I was just a child then . After my brother grown he would come to save me but he get beaten too. He was little but he tries and then to ruin our friendship she always kept comparing us all the time and she is successful but now she doesn’t have a good bond with him either.From childhood she always did what she wanted to do with me .sometimes even blood comes through my mouth but she kept beating.those mars would heal 2to 3 months after.then she would again do it.she always says my shoulder have make her study,she is more fair than me etc even now in every singlething she bullies. I was so dumb that I would believe anything she says if she says humans lay I would believe that too.Then I wasn’t good enough but now I do understand what is right or not.I am a girl with no childhood,no skills,but a loser.
I always wanted to show her can do it but I couldn’t cause no one was there to say I can or keep hand on my head but reather I was bullied in school,neighbours,family,highschool ,college.
I was a hsc24 candidate but my mental health was so bad that I couldn’t attend it .This year is my last chance or my father is not gonna .I can’t express or say this or I have som many things yet to tell but even doctors couldn’t fix me . I attempted suicid so many times I failed or hospitalized .
There was a time when I would want to be lovedfrom every one I would seek it wherever I could find it fortunately I wasn’t misused by others but I got see how cruel humans are . Now I don’t believe in love or relationship. I was always confined in home so I don’t know how to make friends. Last year I was buillied by my class mates, teachers but they act as nothing happened and gave me tc . Some days ago I told my father about the builling he was like I am too emotional,and a loser who can’t do anything but talk. Now I have exam in 2 months they are forcing me to get married or get a+ , but all the they are mentally torturing me now they don’t go on physical violence but it’s even harder those beaten , those marks may go away as I am starting to forget many parts of my memory. She is even beat my 3 years old sister.I can’t help her nor me . I am suicidal but unable to die, unable to believe anyone because everyone listens to money and they have it so I can’t file any case .I don’t want my children to face the same childhood as me but I know I am becoming her day by day . I have no where . I can’t even cry for like 5 months and sometimes I starts to cry on my class or in road . 
I have seen 7 psychiatrist in Dhaka they provide me anti depression medicine and if I take it I sleep all day and could not move my head in pain and become uncontrollable and suicidal. Now I stopped it like 1 year the suicidal thing is gone but but my situation or environment is not going with me . Praying isn’t helping me either. I just feel good when I am outside with people who doesn’t know my parents. But without college I am not allowed to go out without them .",1,1742754257.0
1jh1m48,mj3ubdl,,"I feel like it's painful right now since many things are going to change and things are happening fast. But your mentality that you want what's best for your mom and are supportive about her decision is honestly the biggest help to her at this time. You can try to make plans to see her once she has settled, gift her something she can add as decoration in her new space, contact her often and talk about your daily life. That can help both of you close that gap that long distance can bring. Cliché but time makes things easier. My own mother stayed for us in an unhappy marriage and once we became adults she felt like she couldn't leave because she felt like she was not strong enough to start over. She passed away last year and I feel her biggest regret was not being able to live her dreams and fight for her own happiness. Maybe you can't be happy right now but hopefully you can be happy once you see that she's doing okay. You'll be okay too, just continue to support each other as family.",1,1742623631.0

That is to say if you’re very close there will always be a part that wants to be with your mom, but she’s done her part already. She made sure you grew up and she trusts you’ll be ok in the world on your own now. That’s every parents duty. Now she’s living for herself. Try not to view it as if you’ll never see her again. You two can always reach out and connect whenever you want. Allow yourself to feel whatever you feel during this time you’re adjusting to the change and soon it’ll pass on its own.",1,1742625714.0

1jg9ti5,mj3x7pv,,"Let me just start by saying your parent's love lives are not your responsibility and they should not be putting you in a situation were you have to help them figure that out. You're 18, you should be worried about planning your future and living your youth. Not stressing about your mom's actions and mood swings. I understand if you want to be supportive of your family and you can talk to her about it because it has obviously made you uncomfortable to the point that you asked her to erase it. But if she doesn't see that it's a problem because it's breaking a boundary that she has no right to mess with since she has moved on herself, maybe she should consider therapy to learn to deal with her unresolved feelings of her not feeling like she's enough and emotional outbursts that overwhelm those around her. But remember it's not your fault or your responsibility!! Take care of yourself and your own mental health and your own boundaries. And I don't mean to sound harsh but I had dealt with my own parents trying to place their problems on us as kids and grew up with a lot of anxiety and stress and I don't want you to feel the same way.

Boundary options could be to let them in and they can wait on the couch, or answer the door and tell them you'll be ready in ?? minutes, or don't even answer the door.  You could politely remind them that this is your home and they are welcome to come at agreed upon times, even if that means waiting in the car or on the couch if they arrive early.

1jeivdx,mijkf9w,Formal_Nose_3013,"Well, you have multiple options. How old is your nana? Are you asking this out of concern for her health (does she has any health issues or may react badly)?

You have multiple options:

1) You could go with someone. You do not have to do it alone. You could be with your boyfriend, especially if he is supportive (This is optional). If you are afraid of your nana reaction, you could also involve here someone that she and you trust, so that person is present to calm her down. You have to explain the situation to this person before taking them to your Nana.

2) You could send someone else on your behalf, that your Nana and you trust. Someone that you know that will explain the situation very calmly to her, and not make it worse. 

PD: Additionally, if she has health issues, like heart issues, and you think she will react badly, it is a good idea to think if it is a good idea to tell her. Maybe you can avoid telling her in order to take care of her health. If you must tell her for the well-being of the child, then I would recommend maybe make her sit her down and give her some water to drink before you release the news to her. Also, do this 30 minutes to an hour after she has eaten lunch or dinner. People get easily irritated when they haven't eaten, hence this recommendation. A full belly helps. Perhaps invite her to a restaurant and after eating, release the news. Present the baby as a blessing, not as a problem, and mention how you plan to deal with the situation.

Good luck.",2,1742346993.0

My older brother was like that. He wanted everyone to do everything for him, write his resume for him, get a job for him, support financially his dreams to travel abroad (with no job), and get him a car (my dad gave him). He was unemploy by choice for years (cuz no job was good enough for him).

Your brother sounds frustrated that he can't be at the same level as the rest of the family but expects other people to put him there without moving a finger. People like that the more you give the more they will demand, so at every giving you're setting a higher and higher standard for them. 

Once you stop giving they will say you're this AWFUL and worst person ever and will never recognize what you have done to them.

Now 5 years into his marriage my son and I are broken. He says His wife has never met anyone like me. She comes from a very sheltered upbringing and lives in a bubble of Reality TV and Target runs. Neither of which I participate in. She has gained a lot of weight and is very manipulative and a dictator. I opened my heart to her and we were building a bond, but due to financial reasons I cannot afford to live near them anymore so we are now becoming estranged. I never ever talked behind her back to him.. I expressed love toward her and quietly tolerated her. Accepted her as my daughter. Their house is filthy, she is a bank exec and works full time and the kids go to daycare because she rather pay for that than have me live with them. I get it.. I don't want to live with them either but sometimes sacrifices need to be made to make ends meet and do whatever we think is right..

1jddb0a,mib3i8w,Jean_Wagner,"I am so sorry, and want you to know that you are not alone. This happened to my husband and I two and a half years ago, and we are still going through the healing process. I see some similarities from what you have shared. My husband has three kids from a previous marriage, and the oldest was 10 when we got married. He is now 41, married with two kids of his own. After retiring five years ago, we moved across the country to be near him and his family – something we had all discussed and planned for a very long time. He and his wife even helped look for a house for us since we were out of state. Like you, we had a good relationship with him and his wife, despite her controlling behavior and insecurities. We were thrilled to be able to see our grandkids often, and go to their games and performances. We noticed behavior changes in my stepson right after our move, especially towards my husband, but thought it would just work itself out as time went on…wrong. I won’t go into all of the details, because I don’t want to deflect from your situation, but he and his wife ended up going no contact with us. We felt blindsided, betrayed, and heartbroken, and nothing he told his brother and sister made sense…it still doesn’t to this day. We tried to reach out to them, but were met with nasty, accusatory texts, mostly from his wife. My husband did the same thing as you, which was to send his son a text saying he loved him and that the door was open, hoping they could work things out…no response. Thankfully, we still have a close relationship with my other step-son and my step-daughter, but my oldest step-son’s choices have made this hard for everyone, including his siblings. Sadly, we have met several people who have gone through this as well, and just recently, it happened to some very dear friends of ours (they, too, had a close relationship with their son). I wish I had answers for you as to why this is happening, but I don’t. However, I can share with you some things we have learned that have helped us begin the healing process:

·         Identify your support system. For us, it was a group of friends who allowed us to vent, cry, be angry, and grieve whenever we needed it. They also knew when to set limits with us in a gentle way, so we could focus on other things. Our friends encouraged and reminded us to us to come to them with our emotions, not the other two kids.

·         Keep your relationship with your daughter separate and try not to get information about your son from her. You do not want to put her in the middle. Our oldest has done this to both his brother and sister, which we can’t control. However, they completely see that, and appreciate that we haven’t done the same. We have a rule with them that if they want to bring it up, they are welcome to do so, but we do not initiate any conversations about their brother.

·         Forgive yourself. You are going to drive yourself crazy, going back in time and re-hashing every word, every action, every moment with your son. Don’t try to justify your son’s behavior by being hard on yourself. There is a right way to deal with emotional issues from the past, and a wrong way. I personally believe that going no contact is only acceptable in terms of abuse. Otherwise, there is always a way to work through problems without ending a relationship. You need to remember that this is his choice, not yours. Focus on becoming the best version of you, keep the door open if he chooses to walk through it, but don’t try to fix this…you can’t.

·         If you are a person of faith, dig into that. For us, our faith is what has gotten through our darkest days. In becoming closer to God, our struggle with forgiveness has gotten easier, and we have become more aware of all the many blessings that have come from this.

Again, I am sorry you are going through this and I will be praying that your son can find a better way to work through his hurt than shutting you out of his life. Take care. ❤️",1,1742238244.0

OP. Your situate it’s a toxic stepparent + enabling bio parent is very common. Stepmom is going out of her way to eliminate you from the picture, to make you know you are unwelcome in her house or her family. And if your dad gave two effs he would have stood up for you but didn’t. That is all the answer you need. He’s showing by his actions not his words how little he holds you in regards compared to his wife and other children. Trust me when I say if you looked into other examples, if your dad really wanted to be your advocate he would have found a way to still spend time with you, stood up to his wife for you, made you included in family activities, etc. He hasn’t.  He can SAY the opposite and claim he loves you all he wants, but it’s one thing to make a claim and another to SHOW he cares by his actions. Part of us as children naturally want our parents in our lives, but sometimes they are the ones who cause the most pain. Imagine if the abuse was much worse than it was, as often is the case where abuse leads to the child’s serious injury or death. Or if you had gone through with a suicidal impulse. Your dad would probably still be denying being aware of anything and not holding himself or his wife accountable. You need to focus on yourself snd finding happiness, OP. Forget them and move on. If your siblings show up later and want a relationship with you, build on that.

The way he acted as a child was a missed diagnostic opportunity and now he has no awareness of how and why his brain works like that and he’s never been taught how to be any different and now it’s effecting his ability to be an adult. The thing that really stuck out is him not understanding and being rude interrupting calls still. He lacks boundaries probably because he wasn’t taught any. I have a male friend with severe adhd, he however is kind but can be extremely overwhelming and talk over people, interrupt people , not realize he’s literally screaming at you (generally out of excitement) he doesn’t process things correctly.

1jbdbi9,mht6wbc,AltLifeCoach,"Your sincerity and persistence are admirable. However, repeatedly apologizing or offering gifts might unintentionally pressure your youngest sister. Give her some space; consistently show gentle, unconditional kindness without expecting immediate results. Write the birthday card, but focus on expressing your unconditional love rather than asking for forgiveness or friendship explicitly. This reduces emotional pressure and shows your sincerity. 

Continue small, thoughtful gestures without expecting responses immediately—this patience conveys genuine care. Avoid involving your older sister or family conflicts in conversations with your youngest sister; let her form her opinions independently. Over time, as she matures, she will better recognize and appreciate your past and ongoing care. 

Meanwhile, prioritize your emotional well-being through support from trusted friends or counseling to manage stress and family tensions constructively.

Given time, I understood that he was very jealous of me. Not that I was praised due to something, far from that. He was the golden child, never had to work nor do anything at all, while I had to do everything. The thing is, that I'm cursed with memory and never really had to struggle with learning, except for a period where I nearly died and lost a lot of school days and fell a bit behind for some time after that. In the end, I solved that problem, found a decent job, while he couldn't do anything like that. So, he decided to take my girlfriend from me and you may figure the end of this. You have your kids, he doesn't. You have a happy family, he doesn't. A lot of times, things happen due to that. But you aren't to blame for finding happiness. His problem probably is just jealousy. Don't push for it, he needs to figure for himself what really means to be a family.

1j9m8gb,mhi5ws9,InnaComa,"I was in a similar situation years ago where my wife up and left. My son was 3 at the time. In her case it wasn’t to do with sex or drinking. She just didn’t want that life and I wasn’t given much more of an explanation (she’d go on to become a sheriff’s deputy somewhere and build another life). I was crushed, I was shocked, and that loneliness that you speak of, I knew it well and it was a spear in my heart. I hadn’t known such agony. It was very hard to keep everything going, to keep that mask on just to survive and put one foot in front of the other. 

It took time, not much, as I naturally started adjusting as a single father and adapting. I don’t know if this is where you’re headed given your wife has been gone 5 days, but you will absolutely be ok. Everything will indeed work out. Yes, the road is bumpy and jagged along the way, but it won’t always be like this. I assume you’ve always “been ok” up until now, so hopefully just hanging onto that will give you hope and reminders that everything will continue to be ok overall.

Life is hard, especially in these chaotic times we live in, but it’ll get easier and you’ll become stronger. In fact, I truly believe you’ll find strength and resilience inside that you never knew you had.

It’s good you’re speaking with a counselor, and do stick with that. It’s a matter of building whatever support system you can to help you Through this situation. Even coming on here and letting your feelings out is another avenue of support, and any bit will help.

The loneliness… that’s a hard I know, but it will get easier and you will 100% find solace, whether you choose to be alone, reconcile with your wife, or meet another partner down life’s road. You WILL get there. Just please, if your wife being with multiple partners is an element of her life you do not want to be apart of, then I recommend you don’t. It’s important to be happy and have a trusting relationship on terms you both agree with.

Try to eat, that’s important. And especially sleep, I know it’s hard (especially with your wonderful 1 year old). There will come a point where you’ll look back on this and see how your own strength got you through this. Anyway, continue with the counselor, maybe find a group if you have the bandwidth. You’ll collect tools in your bag for future events and rough roads, because that’s life. But don’t forget that almost always the good times far outweigh the tough ones.

Her logic is that he feeds me, clothes me, and spends money on me so she’s a good mom. 
She is very cribbing as a person. Gets jealous when people compliment me. Makes faces when a friend does anything good for me (last week my friend made tiramisu for me and she legit squinted her eyes lol) 

Now I have distanced myself from that piece of shit. It’s so much better. Like ofc it feels like I am living with a roommate but a roommate who cooks for me and pays my bills. I don’t want to leave this comfortable life. 

So if I only talk to her when I need money. No birthday wishes, no Mother’s Day wishes nothing.

What’s worse, it was my dream car that was the same make and model of one my mom had in my childhood. 

That’s so annoying he doesn’t believe you. Slightly humorous to think of him spamming some poor dude’s phone thinking it’s you.

Bernie’s situation won’t change unless **he decides to stand up**. No one can fight this battle for him—you can only **advise and support**.

# 1. Bernie Must Take Legal Action

* If he truly wants custody, **he must be willing to fight for it**.
* A **family lawyer specializing in special needs** can help, but **only if he takes that step**.
* He needs to **document Lilly’s neglect** (CPS reports, school records, messages) and **petition for a court-monitored parenting plan**.

# 2. He Must Set Boundaries and Enforce Them

* Bernie **must stop caving** to Lilly’s demands—she only controls him **if he lets her**.
* He should **refuse to drop everything** for her emergencies and **stick to a custody schedule**.
* **Therapy** can help him build the emotional strength to stand his ground.

# 3. He Must Prioritize His Own Stability

* To fight for custody, he must **secure a stable job and living situation** first.
* He **cannot keep sacrificing his future** for Lilly—his **role is to be a father, not her backup plan**.

**Your Role:** Advise, support, and encourage him, but **he has to want this** and be willing to fight for himself and his kids.

She had asked me to come home, which had never happened. I moved away 2p years before that but I  went back 2-6 times a year. But covid hit and I couldn’t. She asked me to come home and despite covid, I was going bc she never asked me bc I was there enough as it was. 

That is so awful they didn’t let you say goodbye. I know exactly how it feels. A bit different scenario but it still feels the same. I needed to say goodbye, sounds like you did too. 

As for the $, there could  be consequences. I suggest you talk to a lawyer, specializing in estate law. Brother  may have got her to sign over power of attorney and if he did, it could be legal. But it also could be unauthorized agency, basically forgery. 

Was there a will??? Don’t fret if there wasn’t bc there are also intestate laws (dying without a will, vary by state but are pretty similar). If she had any joint accounts with him, joint car loans, anything where his name is on it too, 1/2 goes to him automatically. But you don’t get to help yourself before her death.

If they are still married & she didn’t give your kids gifts, that means neither did your BIL. They are a unit and your BIL is the one related to your husband, so the issue is actually with him. It’s his responsibility to ensure his side of the family (which inc you/hub/your kids) is treated respectfully. 

It’s also your husband’s responsibility to handle his side of the family. If his brother & SIL lack manners in saying thank you for gifts + have a problem giving back gifts to your kids, he should ask his brother why. 

But I agree with you, stop giving gifts to them unless this is resolved. 

And we no longer speak to my hub’s brother & his wife. They were disrespectful to us for years and also did not say thank you for multiple gifts we sent their kids (we don’t have kids).

Most of the time, we are the ones picking out the gifts etc. or getting blamed for things — as if our husbands don’t have their own brains and are fully capable of making their own decisions. If your BIL respected your husband, he would not allow this. So that tells you guys how he really feels. 

I don’t blame y’all if you go LC or NC.",1,1741791248.0
1j84zbc,mhe3zwo,Soft-Breakfast7694,"I sincerely appreciate your response and insight on this. They’re not separated and I agree I shouldn’t be directing all blame at her. I think I do that because my husband’s side of the family has created that dynamic and I’ve been conditioned to it… I’ve mentioned him speaking to his brother about it although with the time that’s passed since I feel like it’s a lost cause. And moreso just an uncomfortable conversation to have. Everytime I think about how we/he could address it I feel like it comes across greedy as if to say “where’s my gift?”.

Thanks again for your feedback.",2,1741790419.0

And even if there isn’t a reason for him being favoured in adulthood, I think it’s a bit unfair of you to distance yourself from him. It’s not like he asked to be the favourite yk? At the end of the day he’s your brother so try to reconnect if there isn’t any other reason :)",1,1741662164.0
1j7zl1w,mh0wm03,Ultra-Cowbell-394,"Here's the thing, I don't want his stupid wallet, I want a real dad. It feels like he wants to buy a  way out of guilt, or this is the only thing he knows how to actually do. It's not like he isn't getting good examples of how a healthy relationship should be, my aunt and me asking how you are doing AND feeling, actually digging into a subject that is important to him/me/her. He drifted in and out of the relationship when I was a kid because he was always busy with physical work, and taking physical care of mom. Taking things out of my hands is what he did I think because it went too slowly, not doing things together. I feel like walking away again, deserving better. He estranges everybody from himself including mom, and he probably doesn't even know it.",1,1741616090.0
1j7t7u4,mh1mgdg,LopsidedAd2172,"She sounds like she just uses you off what you can do, i.e. babysitting or dog sitting. She is not concerned about you leaving the forces because you PTSD, or what you went through that led to you developing it. She is more concerned that you are going to receive something her husband didn't. You do deserve it, don't let her tell you otherwise. Watch out too, that she doesn't try to talk you into giving her whatever you get because she deserves it more. Good luck, and look after yourself.",1,1741623928.0
1j7sv5k,mh81cpa,AltLifeCoach,"Your situation sounds emotionally draining and toxic. If you’re of age and have the means, consider leaving to protect your well-being. Distance can bring clarity and peace. If leaving isn’t an option, seeking professional counseling or support from a trusted mentor can help you navigate this situation.   
  
Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to be in an environment where you feel respected and understood. Focus on building a support system and setting boundaries to protect your mental health. Prioritize yourself—you don’t have to endure this alone.

Go to the wedding, or don’t.  Think of future holidays.  You gonna be at all the family events? Travel and make new framly?

I mean yes, maybe have a comb where you tell her how you feel and she needs to take a stand for you as it makes you feel belittled. Coz if she doesn’t take stand today, you will be signing up for a person who never speaks up for you, who is ok when you are belittled.",1,1741588190.0
