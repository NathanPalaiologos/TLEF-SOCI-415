## Introduction

**Sociology has changed**. It’s no longer just theory and text. It’s an **ever-evolving fusion of data, algorithms, and human stories**. 

**Sociology** -- and its power to map social patterns -- drives new insights. Survey data, social media, census records: features selected, models trained, findings validated. Contextualization. Interpretation. Critical reflection. 

**Sociology has changed**. The era of narrative alone has given way to data-grounded discovery In the quest to understand inequality, networks, and collective behavior. And those who harness both numbers and nuance, redefine how we see society. **Sociology has changed**. When social phenomena are both seen and measured, the discipline is transformed.



## Notebook 1: Classification through Naive Bayes and BERT [Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NathanPalaiologos/TLEF-SOCI-415/blob/main/demo/SOCI415.ipynb)

**Learning Outcomes**: Through this class, students will

- understand the how we can text data are vectorized for qualitative analysis in Computers.
- understand what is a classifier, how does it work, and how it can be applied to sociological studies.
- classify texts in a classical approach that requires training data.
- apply a theory they've learnt in the course to let a LLM label texts for them, without fitting training data.
- critically evaluate the quality of classification, and analyze the pros and cons of using LLM in sociological studies.

## Class Structure

### Part A: Intro to Vectorization and Classification

- In this part, we will use a labeled text dataset related to topics discussed in the course, vectorize it, and show with 2D visualization what text data look like in the eyes of a classifier.
- We will then train the model with a training set, and test the prediction quality with a test set. Here we introduce the concept of **train-test split**, which helps us evaluate how well our classifier generalizes to new, unseen data.
- Lastly, we cover how do we evaluate the quality of prediction using **accuracy** and how we can visualize the result using a **confusion matrix**. This provides students with a basic insight of machine learning.

### Part B: Intro to Zero-shot Classification with LLM

- In this part, we will use the same dataset as the previous part and a **pre-trained LLM** to perform classification. 
- We will provide a prompt template let students apply knowledge to generate their own prompts and make classifications.
- We will also show that, provided with a range of possible labels, students can use LLM to predict even beyond the labels in the original dataset.
- Lastly, we will evaluate the quality of predictions, explain the importance of **prompting** in **zero-shot classification** and discuss the pros and cons of using pre-trained LLM.

- **Connection to Academic Reseach**

<div style="font-size: 80%;">
A number of sociology papers employed text classification as their key methodology, for example:

Blodgett, S. L., & Green, L. (2016). Demographic Dialectal Variation in Social Media: A Case Study of African-American English. ArXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08868
